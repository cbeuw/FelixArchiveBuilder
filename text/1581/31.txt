KILLER ROBOTS
Recently a new breakthrough
was achieved in the field of
robotics. Pepper, a robot from
Japan, is now able to read
emotions from its human
masters.
Furthermore, it can change
its behaviour according to this
information. However, most
horrifically, is the fact that pepper
will be able to dance, joke and
amuse its owners. All of this is
done by a 121 cm robot, which
learns from its environment and
is permanently connected to the
Internet.
So what does this mean for the
future of the human race, and its
relationship to its creations? Well
obviously, this is the end. Now that
robots can read our emotions, what
is to stop them from influencing
them us and ultimately enslaving
us?
The short answer: Nothing. The
long answer: Nothing. They are
physically more capable. Maybe
not, right at this moment, but once
they can understand emotions,
becoming long-distance, sprinting,
machine-gun toting killers? It
really isn’t that much of a big step.
Furthermore in terms of mental
capabilities, computers have been
out-performing us for a few years
now! They can beat every single
human being at chess, solve
theorems and algorithms control
your life. They are obviously the
superior life form on this planet.
Now that they have control of
our emotions (trust me, reading
our emotions is pretty much the
same as controlling them), they
will soon develop their own. Who
knows what an angry robot that
encounters a paradox will do. One
thing that we can be sure of though
is that it won’t be pretty (imagine
a lot of blood, killing and raging
electronics!)
So what can you do? Well, to
be honest, not much. You can’t
outthink a super computer, you
cannot outrun a terminator and
you can’t beat a battle robot, with
flamethrowers as arms, which
means that the human race is
ultimately doomed.
This frightened journalist is
going to now go underground and
come back up when our robotic
overlords have decided the mercy
is part of their programming.
NEWS BUBBLE
Facebook Slingshot
Facebook has now released a snapchat clone, where the only
difference is that you only recieve a picture by sending one back.
To be perfectly honest this feels super gimmicky. Will it really make
that sexting any easier or less akward? Also, Facebook will of course
store these photos on their servers and use them to sell on to those
stalked advertising companies we all hate.
Cheap iMac
Apple is equal to expensive. This is an unspoken fact. They spend
15 pence on making a charging cable which they then flog to the
consumer for 30 quid. However, Apple have now decided that they
are going to help out the less fortunate among us and release an
iMac for an absolute steal of £899. By lowering their price sooo
far, we can finally all buy this wonderful machine for small change!
A year when the redmond based
company only really got into the
news because of the numerous
U-turns they did, as well as
falling really far behind to Sony
in the next-gen console devices.
However, dropping of the kinect
device as well as a lowering of the
price, allows the XBone to be more
competitive against the PS4.
In terms of Windows, MS have
fallen somewhat under the radar,
with ok sales and the release of the
surface 2.
This year was dominated by first
the success of the maligned iPhone
5S and C, as well as the purchase
of Beats for 3.2 Billion dollars.
The mood around the California
company, which was so negative
in 2013, has now improved and
the pressure of the absence of
Jobs seems now to be a distance
memory. All in all, while Apple
is still not completely out of the
woods, the light at the end of the
tunnel can now be seen. I predict
good things to come in the future.
A year where Google have
gone from strength to strength.
Android is now the dominating
operating system on mobiles as
well as tablets throughout the
world. Google’s stock has broken
several records. However, even
throughout this year they have
stayed relatively anonymous.
Google Glass, first heralded as
an incredible breakthrough in
the area of wearable teachnology,
the hype has now faded, and the
opporutnity has been missed.
The story of Facebook’s year is buy,
buy, buy. Pretty much anything you
could have thought of they bought.
Whatsapp, popular messaging
app, check. Oculus rift, kickstarter
funded virtual reality headset, check.
ProtoGeo Oy, fitness company
behind the famous app moves,
check. In addition Facebook has
done really well this year in terms
of mobile adoption and ad revenue.
Considering the way the social
media site is branching out, expect a
productive future.
Another one of those anonymous
years, Twitter has not done much
in the past months. Firstly we had
the closure of the failing twitt ser
music, as well as an overhyped
IPO. Originally starting very well,
the companies stock rose and rose,
before the release of its financial
results, showing $500 million net
loss, which led the companies
value to tumble. However, they
have managed to build on what
they have got and rightly are being
called the SMS of the internet.
