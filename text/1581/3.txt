The following sciences students have given a significant
contribution to the operation and improvement of the Royal
College of Sciene Union this year! Congratulations!

the room in question room
won’t be available for tours on
the upcoming accommodation
open day.
Travelling upwards, we
encountered a flooded
bathroom with a non-
functional light, and a rather
worrying sight outside room
310 in House 24. ‘The cave’ is
a longstanding Fisher feature,
a passage between
rooms and the
kitchen, which
has at most
four feet of
headroom.
However,
a portion
of the
w a l l
that was
c l e a r l y
marked as
containing
the carcinogen
asbestos appeared
to have been patched
up with a large amount of
silver duct tape. Exactly what
lies beneath this duct tape is
unknown, but nonetheless
one would think that asbestos
regulations would require
more than just duct tape to
contain it.
Electrical safety
in the building does appear
to have improved, with the
old telephone circuits being
removed and the fuseboxes
checked, albeit only a year too
late. It is remarkable
that the passing of
the recommended
date did not
appear to
trouble the
hall team
as much as
some origami
birds that were
hung from the
fire alarm in a
students’ room last
year, which resulted
in a stern email highlighting
the extreme danger this posed
sent to said student and much
chastising.
It is also clear that the
College have given up any
form of aesthetic maintenance
when it comes to Fisher. Most
of the walls are falling apart
and cracking, the paint in
most places is peeling and the
carpets look like they haven’t
been cleaned in many years.
This is really quite
unfortunate, given that many
residents appear to be quite
attached to what is
left of the building
and the survivor
spirit and
camaraderie
that it
inspires.
Given the
number of
p r o b l e m s
plaguing the
College’s last
major accommo-
dation project, the
late and shoddy Wilson
refurbishment which resulted
in an untreated fungal infesta-
tion that would have fascinated
even the most experienced of
the Biology department’s my-
cologists and floors that were
so uneven and mislaid that
wardrobes seemed in danger
of toppling, one wonders if it
would not be better to spend
the sever-
al hun-
dred million pounds spent
on the new halls refurbishing
Evelyn Gardens to a reason-
able standard?
Investigation
reveals that
these issues
are well-
known to
prospec-
tive ap-
plicants,
with sto-
ries of the
famed 2007
Fisher ceiling
collapse circulat-
ing on The Student
Room. So perhaps the 2015
freshers will actually be glad of
the 40-minute commute that
awaits them.
Just how well maintained
is Fisher Hall?
4 metres
high? Got
a hard
hat?

Huxley Bins
Set on Fire!
It is reported that at some point last
week there was a fire in the Huxley
building, which is home to both
the Mathematics and Computing
departments. In an e-mail sent
to students in the Computing
Department last Friday; the
College said, “An incident was
recently reported of a cigarette
butt causing a fire in a bin located
on level 2 of Huxley building, in
front of the Clore lecture theatre.
Please be reminded that smoking
is not permitted in front of any
of the entrances to Huxley or on
the walkway to Sherfield building.”
The Fire Officer was not available
for a comment.

Professor is Inventor
of the Year
Chris Toumazou, professor
of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering, has won the Inventor
of the Year award for Research at
the European Inventor Awards.
Professor Toumazou won the
award for his work on a new device
called the SNP Doctor, which
uses “small silicon microchips
to identify genetic mutations
that determine a person’s
predisposition to certain hereditary
diseases.” Prof. Toumazou was the
only person from the United
Kingdom to win the award.
James Stirling, who is the Provost
of the College said, “This award
really underlines what Imperial
researchers do best – taking world
leading research and applying it
to help solve global challenges.
The whole College warmly
congratulates Chris. This award
is a brilliant acknowledgement of
his hard work and his innovative
spirit.”
In addition to becoming Imperial’s
first Regius Professor during the
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee year in
2013, he also won the Gabor Medal
at the Royal Society last year. Prof.
Toumazou was also the youngest
professor at the College when he
was appointed at the age of 33.
Prof. Toumazou has set up the
DNA Electronics Company
through Imperial Innovations
in order to market the SNP
Doctor. It is thought that the
new product would save hospitals
large amounts of money, whilst
also providing DNA Sequencing
results to patients in a matter of
minutes instead of weeks. The
company has already announced
collaborations with major firms
such as Roche and Pfizer.
