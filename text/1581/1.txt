More information has come to
light on the scandal that hit the
final exam for first year students
on the Electronic and Information
Engineering (EIE) course. Last
week the students sat their
Operating Systems paper, but
moments after the exam started
there were fits of laughter as the
department had accidentally left
the mark scheme for the first half
of the paper attached.
After some discussion between the
invigilators, the papers were collected
and replaced with fresh copies minus
the offending sheet. When asked by
the Daily Mail for a statement the
College said:
During an examination being taken
by 30 first-year Electrical and Electronic
Engineering students, the first page
of the answer scheme was included
alongside the question paper due to
a printing error. The Department
became aware of the situation within
five minutes of the exam beginning.
The exam was halted and the papers
were removed from the students.
The Department reviewed the
situation carefully and concluded that
students would not have been able to
use the information to any advantage
during the short time they had access
to part of the answer scheme.
Theexamquestionsrequiredstudents
to demonstrate the application of an
algorithm to a given data set setting out
detailed reasoning in their solutions.
The required algorithms were not
revealed in the answer scheme.
Once this was established, the exam
recommenced with the correct version
of the question paper.
However, it has since become clear
that this does not tell the full story.
Reading the first half of the exam paper,
it seems that the solutions could have
provided more assistance in answering
the questions than the College have
let on. According to a student we
contacted, elements of some questions
did not require extensive work to reach
an answer. In fact as part of the first
question of the paper, candidates
are asked to “list advantages and
disadvantages” of three different
algorithms. This would mean
that a student who copied what
was written on the mark scheme
could potentially gain many of the
marks for that part of the question,
without having to add the “detailed
reasoning” the College mentioned.
In addition to this, new information
has now surfaced...

Further concerns have been raised in recent weeks
about the structural integrity of the Fisher Hall
buildings in Evelyn Gardens, including the event
mentioned in the above title.
Following a prior investigation of Fisher last year,
this author visited again to examine the most recent
developments as the building slowly disintegrates around
the poor Freshers inside. The alarming incidents reported
add to the recent controversy surrounding the college’s
accommodation policy, with both the move to North Acton
and the poor quality of the Wilson House refurbishment
sources of concern.
Upon revisiting Fisher, the first Fresher we encountered
(who wishes to remain anonymous) repeatedly described
the building as a ‘shithole’, and mentioned that they knew
someone who had been moved to another hall for a week
recently as the accommodation team worked to repair part
of the ceiling that had apparently collapsed. They was happy
to take us to a part of the building in the corner of House
30 not previously visited, where their friend gave us a guided
tour of a double room.
The ceiling behind the door had a metre-long crack
running through it, which is reported to leak. The far
corner near the window contained a rather
unsightly black patch of mould,
which the occupant
insisted that
t h e
College were
aware of but had yet to
rectify. Something tells me that
