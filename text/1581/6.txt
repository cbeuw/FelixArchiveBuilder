The Results are in – What Did
the Residential Experience
Review do for you?
E a rlier
this year Professor
Debra Humphris Vice-Provost
(Education) set the wheels in motion
for a review of the ‘student residential
experience’ to determine how College
fares against peers and where improvements
could be made. Professor Myra McClure chaired
the review panel, and members of the panel
included Union President David Goldsmith, Union
Deputy President (Welfare) Marissa Lewis, Head of
International Student Support Dr. Sharon Bolton, and
the Director of Residential Services at LSE Ian Spencer.
Of course, the important question that
begs to be asked is “what did these
people recommend?”
College
will undertake a
feasibility study on the
possibility of introducing
a “Rent Guarantor Scheme”
which would enable College to
act on behalf of students seeking
accommodation without a UK-
based guarantor.
College will give greater
consideration to strengthening
student feedback about
renting in the private
sector.
