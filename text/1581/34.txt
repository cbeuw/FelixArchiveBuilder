FRIDAY 20 JUN
36 CLUBS &SOCS
The Most Ancient and
Noble Meat Appreciation
Society has had a long
and illustrious history. Its
distinguished members
have, however, never
been ones to rest on
their laurels, whereupon
came the idea of a
daring expedition to the
forgotten city of Bruges,
in the far-off land known
as Belgium.
Having obtained a most
generous grant from Her
Britannic Majesty’s Imperial
Institution an expedition of six
gentlemen and gentlewomen
was outfitted for the journey,
under the leadership of the
eminent natural historian Helen
Pennington FZSL. Here I
humbly present a short record
of our travels, in the hopes that
it will serve for the edification
and enjoyment of the readers of
this fine journal.
We departed from London
on the afternoon of the 23rd
of May in the year Our Lord
2014. We travelled fast and
light by locomotive and, with
the assistance of a native guide,
soon managed to find our way
to our final destination. The
city presented a very pleasant
aspect – the remains of strong
exterior defences suggested a
warlike past but the wide canals
and richly appointed buildings
also indicated a long history of
prosperous trade. The streets
were narrow but pleasant,
possessing a curious, non-
Euclidean property that greatly
intrigued our logician (see the
attached monograph opposite).
On the day of our arrival the
weather was most agreeable,
very much similar to the climate
of England. However, on our
second day the clouds cleared
to reveal a piercing blue sky
and a truly strange oddity – a
yellow glowing orb of light very
similar to one of Mr Edison’s
electric lamps but of far greater
size and intensity. Fortunately,
this frightful apparition soon
disappeared and the heavens
returned to their habitual grey.
The natives were a hardy
and friendly people. Our
explorations were helped by the
fact that, much to our surprise,
many of them spoke perfect
Queen’s English, which they
had learned from previous
expeditions. We visited many
historical sites around the city
and learned much of it storied
history. It appears that much
of the industry of the town is
dedicated to the production of
a most curious substance called
‘chocolate’. All of our party
found this an intriguing area of
study, and we dedicated a great
deal of time to ensure a most
thorough and comprehensive
investigation was carried out.
In turn, our evenings were
primarily dedicated to the
detailed examination of the
town’s bars and drinking houses.
As per the constitution of our
Society we devoted much of our
efforts to an investigation of the
city’s culinary heritage. This
included partaking of a hearty
luncheon in a humble but
agreeable tavern suggested to us
by the guidebooks of Monsieur
Michelin. We also took the time
to visit a museum dedicated to
so called ‘fries’ – poor relatives
to the great British chips, yet not
without commendable qualities.
While we were only able
to stay in Bruges for three
days we gathered much useful
scientific data. Overall this was
a very successful expedition to a
fascinating and exotic location –
we would certainly recommend
further research in this and
other similar localities.

Last month six members of the Meat Appreciation Society set off for a trip to Bruges.
Little did they know what awaited them. Here are their stories.
