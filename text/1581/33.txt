FRIDAY 20 JUN GAMES & TECH
SECTION BATTLE ROYALE
Recently EA announced a closed
beta for its newest instalment in its
Battlefield franchise. All you needed
to do (and still can do at battlefield.
com/hardline/beta) was give in
your details and hope that EA
decided to pick you. To be honest
with you, I would honestly go for
it. You only lose about 2 minutes
of your time, and potentially get to
test a triple-A title for zilch. I mean,
what do you have to lose?
Anyway, I was lucky enough to
be chosen for the Beta, (although I
believe that pretty much everyone
is chosen) and immediately went
to download the game from origin.
The interface itself is very similar
to battlefield 4 in that you have do
everything pre-game through your
browser. You have a profile, loadout
and can choose your server/game
mode there.
The setting of Battlefield
Hardline is basically cops versus
robbers. However, add into that
tried and tested formula the guns
and mechanics of the Battlefield
series, and you should get a really
good game! Currently since we are
Battlefield Hardline
A serious review by Maximilian Eggl on the latest Battlefield game beta
in beta the game only has two game
modes, namely Blood money and
heist. Blood money is a really fun
capture the flag mode where you
have to steal money from a neutral
safe and bring it back to your own.
At the same time you can steal
from the other sides safe, while
they can do the same to you. Heist
description
I played several rounds of this
mode and was really satisfied. The
gun play from Battlefield, which
was ok to begin really melded
well with the concept of the game
mode. I found it really enjoyable
when I was stealing the cash, the
adrenaline was rushing as I waited
there to pick up the cash and I
was elated when I managed to take
someone down who was about to
rake in big time. Furthermore, the
tactics of this game mode are wide-
ranging and can be completely
different. For example you can play
extremely aggressively, camping out
your opponents safe and kill them
every time they try to bring money
there, or extremly defensively by
just defending your own safe. All in
all it made for a really good gaming
experience.
The heist game mode is similar,
but instead of both teams needing
to steal money from a safe, we
have the robbers needing to crack
a safe and then carry the flag for a
set amount of time. The cops need
to stop the robbers from doing this.
Simultaneously the robbers have a
limited number of respawns, while
the cops can die as many times as
they want. I found this mode really
good as well, however I think that
even just a little teamwork would
make this way better. However, as
always battlefield players are quite a
selfish bunch.
In terms of new content, apart
from the game modes, we have the
addition of new meelee weapons,
like police batons and baseball bats.
Furthermore, the inclusion of a
riot shield which stops most bullets
really is different from what we have
seen before. The best addition in
my opinion though is the grappling
hook and a zipline. This gives
the already interesting movement
options a new dimension which
can lead to completely new tactics
to take out your enemies.
All in all considering that this
game is in beta, as well as being
actually a quite demanding game I
was really impressed by how well it
ran. Very rarely did I have any lag
or performance issues. Everything
was really smooth and looked really
good.
Felix Books
The books section while rather
entertaining, when reviewing the
walk through guides of various
games (which it does too rarely),
still lacks that heavy gaming
influence that for instance the
gaming section possesses. The
editor-in-chief himself remarked:
“I really like gaming, gaming
is fun.” Which completely
supports the idea that he wants
to revamp the books section, and
rename it to the Walkthrough
Books section, furthermore
giving the already overworked
games section team (who were
incredibly successful) the job of
increase the readership.
Felix Sports
Last week the Felix Sports
Sabrecats came up against the
Gaming Giants. After failing to
score a single point, the Sabrecats
were ruthlessly destroyed when
the Giant’s Skene entered the fray.
Furthermore a dismal display by
Sabrecat’s captain Wagle just
went to show that the Giants were
superior to the Sabrecats. After
this humiliating loss owner of
both franchises, Editor-in-chief
Joe Letts said that “I really like
gaming, gaming is fun.”, thereby
sacking the entire Sabrecats
players, and instating the Giants
team as a dual team taking over
the roles of both.
Felix Catnip
Lonely catnip editor looking
for a games editor to make
her section better. He must be
creative with design, have a heavy
focus on gaming, and be able to
write good articles in a pinch. I,
myself, am in charge of a rather
unknown section trying to get
more exposure and readers.
Starting out with a co-editorship
with a possible move into senior
editorship possible (winky face).
Editor-in-chief himself said, “I
really like gaming, gaming is
fun”, meaning he is more than
happy to finally get this section
off the ground, and actually
getting people to meet up.
Felix Hangman
Hey hangman editor here. I have
managed to change the games editors
review of my section before it went to
print. They said that hangman would
be better if it made fun of gaming.
No effing way. Gaming section is
the worst section, and I would rather
wipe read bad poetry than set my
eyes upon that tripe. In fact, you
know what, gaming could do with
a bit more hangman. So from next
year onwards the gaming section
will now be known as the gameman
section, horoscopes, bad jokes and
being really unfunny, just like the
real hangman section! In fact, the
Felix editor himself said, “I really like
hangman, hangman is fun.”
However, if we remember that
Battlefield was released less than a
year ago, should EA be bringing out
the sequel? I honestly have to say
no. Battlefield 4 was a mess when
it came out, and still occasionally
suffers from bugs and glitches.
Hardline proves that Dice can
actually bring out a well-optimized
game that runs well, so why hasn’t
this been applied to Battlefield 4?
Why release an entirely new game
for an outrageous price, when the
engine is the same, most of the
mechanics are the same and there
is relatively little content. To be
honest, I really think that it would
be better if Dice had released
this game as a DLC, and I would
perhaps be more inclined to buy
it. However, for to be paying the
whole £60 or whatever it will cost
is really ridiculous considering I
already have Battlefield 4. I am
sorry EA, but regardless of how
good Hardline is, I will not fall
for your money making schemes.
Shame really, because as an add-on
I would have definitely bought it
and advised others to get it as well.
