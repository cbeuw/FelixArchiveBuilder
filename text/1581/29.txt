FRIDAY 20 JUN FILM & TV
If/when a murder happens,
the excuse of “the mirror made
me do it” is not likely to be an
acceptable form of defence for
the perpetrator. However for
the characters tangled up in
the violent nightmare of film
Oculus, it really is the case that
the antique family mirror drove
everyone ultimately crazy.
21-year-old Tim Russell
(Brenton Thwaites) is awaiting
for discharge from a psychiatric
hospital, where he stayed ever
since a horrific incident that
occurred eleven years ago. He
remembers snapshots of what
happened, with the gruesome
flashback ending with him,
as a ten-year-old boy (Garrett
Ryan) shooting his father.
Reuniting with his older sister
Kaylie (Karen Gillan) in the
outside world, Tim wishes to
start a brand new chapter in his
life, away from the horrors that
took place in their household
all those years ago. But Kaylie
wants Tim to remember and to
exact revenge on the dark entity
that put them in this difficult
situation in the first place. But
remember what exactly? And it’s
from this point on the film starts
to effectively juggle two narrative
strands. One in the present,
and the other focusing on what
happened eleven years ago.
The Russell family, led by
father Alan (Rory Cochrane)
and mother Marie (Katee
Sackhoff), move into their
new home, which is where the
deadly mirror in question first
makes its appearance. It’s a part
of Alan decorating his office,
although little does he know how
much of a twisted, sinister turn
his domestic life will take as a
consequence of having that ugly
relic around the house.
At first they are small, minor
changes, then they develop into
disturbing visions, stomach-
turning violence, leading up
to downright insanity. Marie
and the children are thrown
into this also, building up to
a crashing climax that leads to
Tim becoming institutionalised
at a young age.
In the present, Kaylie
remembers all about what went
on during the dark periods of
her childhood. She tracks down
the haunted mirror, does her
research, and is ready to test and
destroy it once and for all. Her
family name was clearly hit hard
by bad press surrounding the
news coverage of that infamous
night, and now she’s willing to
prove everyone’s innocence, her
father’s as well as her brother’s.
The cameras are set up to
record everything, and she has
also dragged along her reluctant
brother to take part in what looks
like a risky experiment.
Now this mirror is a piece of
work. It has defence mechanisms
of its own, and has the knack
of playing some serious mind
games with the poor fools who
try to tackle this problem head
on. It plays with the characters’
minds, placing them in wildly
confusing and equally dangerous
situations. And even with a single
misstep, Kaylie’s plan will fall
spectacularly apart. As the focus
of the horror film starts toying
with the protagonists, the equal
effect is had on its audience, in
its gripping, spooky atmosphere
that has an advantage of not
being utterly predictable from
start to finish.
The performances are
uniformly excellent, the best
work coming from Scottish
actress Karen Gillan, handling
her meaty role with confidence,
with the added bonus of putting
on an impeccable American
accent. Cult favourites Cochrane
and Sackhoff have more to do
than the audience is initially lead
to believe, and they both pull off
terror beautifully.
Very few horror films have
satisfying endings, and Oculus is
no exception when it comes to
this department of becoming the
flimsiest part of the movie, having
had such incredible scenes of
terrifying and effective build-up.
But the film opens itself up for
possible sequels, and with the
endless horror opportunities that
the deadly mirror provides, bring
on part two and whoever wants
to square off against it.
Justice League assemble
The rumour mill is exploding with numerous casting announcements
as well as wild speculations surrounding Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel
sequel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Here is what little
we know so far...
Brit actor Henry Cavill will be
back: reprising his role as Clark
Kent/Superman. Hurrah.
Whether you like it or not, Ben
Affleck WILL be playing Bruce
Wayne/Batman.
Relative unknown Gal Cadot is set
to play Wonder Woman, adding
a much-needed female superhero.
Jason Momoa (aka the guy who
rapes Daenerys in Game of
Thrones) will play Aquaman.
Fast-talking Oscar nominated actor
Jesse Eisenberg is confirmed for
Lex Luthor, Superman’s nemesis.
Bruce Wayne’s loyal butler, a role
once filled by Michael Caine, goes
to the equally great Jeremy Irons.
Amy Adams is signed on to return
as Superman’s girlfriend, award-
winning journalist Lois Lane.
The only parenting figure of
Superman who hasn’t died, Diane
Lane will guide Clark as Martha.
Laurence Fisburne will be Clark’s
new boss, as the editor-in-chief of
Daily Planet, Perry White.
Please let this be true. Loki as the
new Joker? Yes please. He’ll be
absolutely incredible.
No Justice League movie can be
without Catwoman. Emily Blunt is
reportedly circling the role.
In honour of Ben Affleck playing
Batman, there have been stories
Matt Damon could be Robin.
Stephen Amell, playing CW’s
Green Arrow (ie DC’s version of
Hawkeye), is up for joining.
Yeah, nice try Ryan Reynolds, The
Green Lantern will not be a part of
this. Not for a while anyway.
He may have dropped out of 50
Shades of Grey, but could Charlie
Hunnam be The Flash?
