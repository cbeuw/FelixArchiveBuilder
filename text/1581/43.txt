How England’s boys did
runs the rule over the Three Lions
Continued from Back Page
Rooney did score though in a
much-improved spell from the
Three Lions midway through the
Second Half. However, Suarez was
able to capitalise on an error from
England captain (and Suarez’s
Liverpool team mate) Steven
Gerrard to blast the Uruguayans
to victory and leave England’s
campaign hanging by a thread.
It had been an encouraging
performance again from England,
as they seemed to compete against
a team that not many would have
given them a chance against a few
months ago.
However there were very
worrying signs at the back again for
the Three Lions, as they seemed
all at sea when trying to deal with
Luis Suarez’s brilliance.
England manager Roy Hodgson
will know that he has gained a
lot of plaudits with his team’s
performances over the first two
games. However, he will also know
that almost all of those plaudits will
disappear if they fail to hold up
their end of the bargain by beating
Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on
Tuesday at 5.

JOE HART
Had a so-so game. Though
he possibly could have
done better for the Suarez
goal.
Leighton BAINES
Was fairly anonymous
going forward and will
need to do more to prove
he was the right choice.
Gary CAHILL
Was culpable along with
Jagielka for Suarez’s
second goal. OK otherwise.
Phil JAGIELKA
Seemed all at see when
defending against both of
Suarez’s goals.
Glen JOHNSON
Provided a brilliant
assist for the Rooney goal,
and was a threat going
forward.
Raheem STERLING
Not great when compared
to his performance in
the Italy game. Needs
experience.
Steve GERRARD
Lost the ball that led to
the first goal. Misjudged
the header that led to the
second goal.
Jordan HENDERSON
Was fairly anonymous for
the most part of the game.
Danny WELBECK
Struggled today and
will need to produce a
performance against
Costa Rica
Wayne ROONEY
The one bright spot, but
he needs to produce this
performance more often.
Daniel STURRIDGE
With the exception of
the build up to the goal,
Sturridge didn’t have a
good day at the office.
