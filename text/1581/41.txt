FRIDAY 20 JUN HANGMAN
NEW research has shown that a sensationalist
headline published in the Felix section,
Hangman has directly caused a huge national
spike in sensationalist headlines.
More and m o r e
headlines (insets)
appear to be
e x a g g e r a t i n g
the claims of
p u b l i s h e d
reports -
statistical and
scientific.
It appears
that the mere
publication of
such headlines
increases so
does the number
of misinformed
articles based on those
headlines.
Or maybe not but most likely it does and
also, there’s a really good chance that this
encapsulates everything that’s wrong with
Britain today.
In fact, it’s almost certainly a disgraceful
violation of all the principles that make us Brits
great.
At any rate, what we can assume is that since
this headline has been loosely derived from an
obscure research paper or misconstrued from
some statistical data we can safely readjust our
lifestyles.
GOSH, these celebrities have made yet another mistake.
Could be in their extremely expensive
and well-made clothing or it might
just have been something
they said.
Anyway, your insults
are definitely justified
and definitely not an
angry manifestation
of the profound
inadequacy and
uselessness of your
life.
I mean sure,
these guys made a
very public mistake a n d
that should probably earn t h e m
a little bit of stick, but this level of gleeful
schadenfreude is almost certainly loosely masking a deep
dissatisfaction with all the opportunities missed and
horrendous decisions taken.
But sure, don’t worry about it, these guys probably won’t
hear your lurid insults that would never be said to anyone’s
face.
Because after all, they are successful millionaires with
multiple talents and a bright future whereas you’re a
complete failure with no prospects left to rue what could
have been if you had any ounce of talent or desire to work
hard.
Fuck those famous guys at any rate.
This guys pretty darn talented and very handsome, but you should
probably make fun of his hat or glasses or something Credit: Onsecrethunt
