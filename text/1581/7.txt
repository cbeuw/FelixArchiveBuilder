FRIDAY 20 JUN FEATURES
W
ithout making
so bold a
claim so as to
say that we’ve
never watched
porn, it’s fair to say that neither
of us are connoisseurs of the
cinematographic genre. However,
the 2005 feature-length Pirates,
with its million-dollar budget, was
the most expensive pornographic
film ever made at the time, a title
now held by its 2008 sequel. This
seemed like it would be viewing
worthy of our comparatively
innocent eyes, and certainly stood
to be a good candidate to meet his
quality standards.
I wouldn’t say that it’s the
best film that I’ve ever watched,
but it was definitely the best
porn I’ve ever seen, in terms of
cinematographic value. Being 129
minutes long, it did start to drag in
some parts, but the storyline did
hold its weight (being very similar
to Pirates of the Caribbean,
although not so identical that it
was boring).
The film follows a pirate hunter
as he, along with his first officer
(played by the well-known Jesse
Jane) embark on a mission
to catch the most feared of all
pirates, and rescue the husband of
a beautiful girl that they’ve picked
up along the way. This is all done
in an attempt to foil his plan to
gain great powers from the Sceptre
of Inca, which obviously requires
a descendant of the family to
which it was entrusted to activate.
I’m sure you can see where this is
going. There is a surprisingly long
plot diversion following a Chinese
gunner, Wu Cho (who is as
stereotypical as you can imagine),
as spends almost the entire
duration of the film searching
for potassium nitrate. Despite it
being 1763, it’s never referred to
as saltpetre; clearly the writer of
the script was insistent that the
scientific accuracy be maintained
for a modern audience.
Until I watched this film, I wasn’t
aware that silicone implants,
peroxide, or extensive waxing were
commonplace in 1763. All of the
actresses were artificially modified
in the breast department, which I
think is an occupational hazard of
the genre. That said, as obvious
as I found this, it was apparently
not apparent to a non-female
observer. A commendable aside
of the historical inaccuracies is
that the participating male actors
wore condoms during penetrative
sex. This practice, although fairly
commonplace, and sometimes
legally required now, was fairly
unusual in 2005 (and certainly in
1763), and shows how progressive
this film was, in terms of the genre.
We were in agreement that the
aspect that let the movie down was
the acting. Obviously, the actors
in a film such as this are chosen
at least partially for reasons other
than their ability to act as though
that giant CGI sea-monster (ooh-
er) is real, and the pool from which
they can be chosen is far smaller.
Although some of the (non-sex)
acting was indeed very good,
there did appear to be an inverse
correlation between the ability
to make the character believable
and the ability to perform a really
hot sex scene, which was slightly
disappointing. The biggest name
in this film, Jesse Jane, was
definitely the weakest actor, but
certainly drew in viewers in her
own right. Despite this, the script
was strong enough that it was
possible to imagine good acting,
and the stiff reading of lines didn’t
really detract any enjoyment,
merely adding some comedic
value. Several of the leading
actors won AVN awards for best
actor and actress, which might
say more than I could about the
quality of acting compared to
other competing productions.
What was unusual about this film,
in comparison to most extended
pornography, was that the erotic
scenes didn’t appear contrived; for
all the scenes, there was context
and build up. Yes, this could have
been better, but as the New York
Times described it, “a relatively
high-budget story of a group of
ragtag sailors who go searching for
a crew of evil pirates who have a
plan for world domination. Also,
many of the characters in the
movie have sex with one another.”
This film is described as having
been made to appeal to women as
wellasmen,andthisisevident.The
film opens to a young, newlywed
woman, nervously stripping for
her husband for the first time.
This is unexpectedly well-acted,
and is initially realistic. However,
the sex rapidly became too porny,
and I think the producers missed
a trick by skipping the niche
appeal of a virginity
scene, which women could have
related to. What disappointed
me most, watching this film as
a woman, was the ratio of male
to female orgasms in each of
the erotic scenes. There were no
female orgasms shown in any
scene where a man was present,
and in only one of the all-girl sex
scenes (where it wasn’t really clear,
but I’ll give it). This inequality
particularly saddens me, because
I find it thoroughly unnecessary.
I don’t think there is anyone
who is going to be turned on by
a pornographic (male and female)
sex scene, who would be turned
off by watching a female climax.
I’m sure that these world-famous
actresses are perfectly capable of a
magnificently faked orgasm, and
certainly, there is time to include
it in a film this long.
Even with a million-dollar
budget, there’s only so much
money left for CGI, and we were
left wondering which of the sex or
battle scenes were more realistic.
They seemed, at times, to have
plumped for quantity rather than
quality, with a large number of
beautiful sweeping shots of what
could have been Play-Doh boat
models. That said, the non-
computer-generated scenes were,
on the whole, very well-composed
and shot, with the exception of
a few rather oddly-placed light
sources (and I’m not talking
about the non-conventional use of
candlesticks in the final scene).
This is a critical analysis, and
I am picking on the bad points
of the film, but I should end by
saying that as far as pornographic
films go, this was definitely of very
high quality, and I would go as
far as to say that it preaches far
fewer bad habits that most porn.
The media frequently reports
on how damaging it is for young
people to learn about sex from
pornography, a sentiment that I
would agree is true to an extent.
However, with an immensely
popular pornographic feature
such as this moving towards a
more realistic portrayal of sex, I
see no reason to artificially shield
the next generation as ours never
was in the days before parental
controls.
A
ll this said, the best
judge of porn has to
be its ability of inspire
carnal lust. And did it
succeed? Sadly, the
only se[a]men to be seen that night
were of the onscreen variety; Mr
Wu’s puny gunshots were unable
to arouse any other kind of shots
that night, something which no
amount of saltpetre could fix.

with the condition that it be in HD, in Dolby Surround.
