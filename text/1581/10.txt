What have you been doing for the
last year?
My year has been so varied and busy!
I’ve learned a lot, supported many clubs,
new ideas and events, and represented
students nationally. I’m most proud
of the Union Sports Strategy and
Activities Development Fund which
will create more opportunities for
student activities in the future.
Top Four Favourite Colours?
1 – Algae Green, 2 – Pine Green, 3 –
Shamrock Green, 4 – Avocado Green.
Green things make me happy! The
Green Huntsman Spider evokes mixed
emotions but looks amazing
Best thing you’ve done this year?
This would be the Student Consultation
Framework that I developed. This is a
document, produced through extensive
consultation with College staff and
students, which sets a standard for
how students should be consulted on
changes that affect them.
Will you lobby the College to
develop halls in Hyde Park?
How absurd! However I did rally time
and time again for the occupation of
Kensington Palace and its gardens.
Unfortunately the College consistently
sided with the royals and defeated every
one of our Constituent Union armies.
Best thing you’ve done this year?
Tom was busy and unable to come back
to us. However he has had a successful
year as the chair of the Recreational
Clubs Committee and of course won
the Presidential election. - Ed.
What was Tom up to instead?
Tom was probably chopping wood in a
forest somewhere, saving children from
fatal accidents or moving frantically
up and down while trying to avoid
protruding pipes. We wish him well -
Ed.
Best thing you’ve done this year?
Probably having dinner with Professor
Lord Robert Winston - it was definitely
the highlight of a lot of hard lobbying
work over the Immigration Bill. It was
pretty incredible to hang out in the
House of Lords and watch the debate.
How much do you like Cyan and
Magenta?
Genuinely the names of my future
children.
Best thing you’ve done this year?
Abigail was busy with exams and
unavailable for comment. As Tour
Manager of IC Sinfonietta and a keen
martial artist she was elected as next
year’s DPCS. Good luck Abigail! - Ed.
What was Abigail up to instead?
Aside from exams we think Abigail
was either conducting chemistry
experiments galore, demonstrating
her martial arts experience on club
“naughty officers” who failed to pass the
“Key Information” quiz or practising
for a summer concert - Ed.
How do you think the Union can
improve?
The Union can improve by trusting
the intelligence of its members to make
decisions about their own lives.
What’s your favourite thing about
Metric?
The thing like most about Metric is that
I can be totally and utterly safe there
thanks to the Safe Space Policy. Also
that fact no-one else is there helps too.

As at least 39.9% of you know,
last term saw the election of a new
team of Union sabbatical officers
and full-time roles; people who
have taken a year to focus on
things that directly affect “you the
student”.
The official terms of all full-time
roles change on August 1 each
year, and things still happen
during summer, but this is the
last time we’ll be seeing the Sabbs
during term, before the new team
take over next year.
At the top of this spread you’ll
hear from this year’s officers, and
at the bottom you’ll see next year’s
eager young’uns.
