FRIDAY 20 JUN
40 FOOD
Hello - I’m Serverella, your
average neighborhood waiter.
Just like Cinderella, I’ve been
“forced” into drudgery to
get by; except outside of
the Grimm era, I work at the
coalface of the service and
hospitality industry to survive
in pricey London, and said
drudgery is by choice.
Don’t get me wrong; unlike
Cinders, my job is more than
menial labour - I actually get to
bat my lashes at a variety of folk
in semi-decent uniform, and I’m
certainly not covered in soot/
cinders by the end of my shift.
It’s just as grueling though; I can
be on my feet for up to 10 hours
per shift. I enjoy it in some weird
way, though sometimes I wish
customers would make it better for
us - it’s actually not that difficult.
So here are some of my musings
on what goes on behind the
scenes, and some tips on how you
can make the most out of your
hospitality-industry experience
(whether it’s a birthday party,
casual first date, classy business
schmoozing or your bajillionth
anniversary) - this way, you can
help us help you.
GETTING ONE FOOT IN
We’re well aware some places are
so bloody popular that reservations
are damn well expected/a must
(looking at you, Sushi Tetsu), and
others (hello MEATLiquor!) just
don’t do reservations - so you have
to try your luck right when it opens
and hope to high heaven you get
in. And some establishments are
the poncey type where even if they
don’t say so, they’ll be snooty to
walk-ins.
But what about those you’re not
sure about popularity-wise (read:
most places)? As a starting point,
if you know you’re after a weekend
primetime lunch/dinner slot,
don’t be a self-centered yuppie -
PLEASE RESERVE EARLY (if
they take them.) If you’re coming
in on a chilled day (Mondays and
Tuesdays tend to be dead-days for
restaurants - it’s why you get most
deals happening on those days) or
a bit of an off-peak time, you could
just walk in and ask the host(ess)
nicely. It goes without saying that
your chances increase loads if
you’re there right when it opens -
compared to when the night is in
full swing.
On the subject of OpenTable for
reservations…establishments would
much rather you call to reserve - it
costs us a fee per diner (nevermind
the crazy start-up and monthly
subscription costs), whereas
phoning/emailing us directly
bypasses that. Think of the site as
the Ticketmaster of the restaurant
world - albeit quite hated by peeps
in the industry. Those “OT-only”
deals you got on their site? Some
of them are actually a sneaky way
for restaurants to pass on the
per-diner cost. Others make up
for it by hiking prices up post-
installing OpenTable. Emailing is
free, and allows us to keep more
of our profits (don’t be surprised
if some restaurants act a little bit
colder towards OTers...I’ve seen it
happen.)
Big group? For the love of
Michelin, wherever you go, don’t
just show up - please phone or
email way ahead of time. There
will most likely be a minimum
spend of some sort (to discourage
stingy campers who’ll spend nawt),
but sometimes if your group has
been amazing your server might
throw in a nice surprise...more on
freebies and attitudes later though.
NO-SHOW ETIQUETTE
We get it, life’s a b***h and
sometimes things just get in the
way. Or other times you’re still
undecided between two places for
that special surprise and figured
you’d book two to be safe and stand
up on one when you’ve decided.
Either way, we know minds and
plans change; just please PLEASE
phone or email us to let us know
you won’t be coming, whether it’s a
busy day or not. Sometimes we get
unexpectedly slammed with walk-
ins, so you taking the trouble to tell
us in advance helps us make sure
we can make another unexpected
customer happy.
Same goes for if you’re running
late - most places will hold your
table for up to 30 mins without
you giving notice, but it’s much
better for us all if you say ahead of
time how far away you’ll be. Your
table isn’t the only one in your
server’s section, and any notice
you can give us helps us organize
ourselves a bit better. Scratch our
back and we’ll scratch yours by
trying to make sure you won’t have
to rush through your main course
in 10 minutes because we need to
turn tables for the next seating.
Be sensible, though. Restaurants
actually keep track of repeat no-
shows and cancellations - if you’re
the kind to stand us up 13 times
out of 15 reservations, eventually
we won’t even bother accepting
your booking.
FREEBIES
Oh we can tell who you are all
right - those of you who want
something for nothing. Your
servers are canny like that (even
the bartenders you were trying to
sweet-talk for “birthday shots”),
but we can tell you that if you
don’t expect it and are all-around
pleasant, and it’s genuinely a social
occasion or you’re a good regular,
more often than not we’ll *maybe*
give you a free something. One
thing’s for sure, though: name-
dropping the owners is NOT the
way to go. You know the owners
personally? Great, so do we! Half
the time we probably despise them
- nice try, bub.
Sometimes when you get a
freebie, you don’t have to feel too
bad about it - we’ve usually got a
little “freebie tab budget”/stock we
reserve for complimentary goodies
on that night, so we can afford it.
Other times though we’ve got to
twist our managers’ arms before we
can comp your drink - so be nice!
At a bar? A decent tip (beyond
your usual 1-2 quid) goes a long
way in getting your bartender to
sweeten up. They’ll be even more
inclined to remember your name
and drink choices before you open
your mouth (even if they’re usually
very good like that, tip or not.)
SOME WAYS TO PISS US OFF
Once you’re shown to your table,
for heaven’s sake, sit where you are
seated. Nothing personal - there
really are so many good tables,
and unless you’ve put in a special
request/are a good regular your
chances of getting a good table
may be slim. Don’t be an asshole
by requesting a bigger 4-pax table
when there are just two of you -
if the place fills up, I sure as hell
refuse to turn people away just
because your Gucci/LV is warming
the two spare chairs. Can we say
mismanagement of resources?
Just as douchey would be asking
to move tables because you feel
shafted. For Roux’s sake, planning
seating arrangements requires just
as much meticulousness as Gulf
ware plans.
I cry at the number of people
who are more interested in their
cellphones than engaging with
their dates/mates and paying full
attention when ordering from
their servers. Unless you’re a doc
on standby waiting for an organ to
arrive, turn the darn thing off (and
if you are, wouldn’t you be eating
in the hospital cafeteria anyway?)
There are plenty more ways you
can rock - or suck - when you’re
dining out, though sadly they won’t
all fit on this page. Interested in
hearing more tales from my end?

out norms? Want to share your
