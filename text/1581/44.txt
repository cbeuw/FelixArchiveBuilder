FRIDAY 20 JUN
46 SPORT
PELOTON
TO
PARIS
Continued from Back Page
With great trepidation and supposition
the brave fifteen prepared for a two day
cycle to Paris; an Arch to Arc ride through
Southern English countryside to promised
celestial heights of French tarmac. In
pensive preparation for the challenge ahead
many members settled into a relaxing night
of partying in central London, while others
relaxed to an evening of car hunting and bag
loading until the early hours of the night.
And after a restful two hours of sleep it was
time to depart for Marble Arch.
In great style everyone arrived precisely for
the 4:00am meet; a semblance for times to
come. The chilled darkness of Marble Arch
endorsed a frosty air of great expectation.
Michael Kaye, our support driver and joint
tour organiser with Vicki Solly captured the
moment at Marble Arch before firing the
metaphorical starting pistol for our 288km
journey.
100m round the corner and we had our
first stop. Fran’s saddle had gone floppy and
the trusty Garmin route plan was corrupted.
It had decided we would fly there in a dead
straight line. Our team guide Matthias Knop
swiftly employed some crossed fingers and
leprechaun luck to set us moving once
again. This was however not the end of our
Garmin glitches.
London proved slow but clear road
cycling, and before we knew it we were
reunited with the support car. A Nature
Valley in the stomach and a cereal bar in
the back pocket and pedals turned
once again. Cycling in a group
of fourteen has two major
issues: English roads
are never straight, so
cars have very limited
time and space to
overtake, leaving
some overtakes
dangerously close to
handlebars; the other
is a caterpillar effect
when the Peloton
front changes pace.
A slight touch on the
brakes by the Peloton
leader and the back of
the pack is emergency
braking to avoid a collision.
By the two hundredth kilometre
we had filtered the effects down and
were substantially smoother, but there were
many alarmed squeals escaping the peloton
before that.
The second rest stop taught us all a lesson
on how to relieve oneself in public while
wearing cycling gear. First one must waddle
around in cycling cleats to find a suitable
bin/bush/tree to hide behind.
Then it is a complicated
labyrinth of lycra to
negotiate with a re-
enactment of the
“walk-off pants
r e m o v a l ”
scene from
Zoolander
for the
boys and
a far more
complicated
achievement
by the girls.
However as
always, we
power through
whatever obstacle
in the name of our
cause. The final 40km
was ahead, and time was
rapidly disappearing to get to the
ferry at Newhaven.
Time for Garmin glitch #002. Youthfully
optimistic we turned on to a dead-end road
and persuaded each other that the Garmin
must be correct, before reaching a dirt track
to a chorus of “I told you this was a dead-
end” and “this is going to be bad for my
bike!” Nevertheless, any obstacle and the
next kilometre was completed at a nerve
shatteringly slow pace. Laughing it off back
on tarmac we proceeded into yet another,
even muddier bridle path that was clearly
not correct. Muddy cleats and slipping
wheels, bikes on shoulders and mud filled
brakes, we introduced our road bikes to the
joys of mountain biking; amazingly, without
a puncture.
Finally, the hills of Newhaven presented
themselves to us, along with the first
puncture. A relaxed and hard earned descent
turned quickly into wheel locking panic as
Tom Bartissol (our French host) suddenly
stopped halfway down in front of a pothole
with a puncture. In our special supportive
way we all hurled abuse at him as we passed
wondering why he had stopped. Then
collectively agreed he had completely over
reacted and must have stop to announce “le
tres dangeroux pothole”. The error was soon
