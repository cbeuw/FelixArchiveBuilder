The future is sure an ugly, grim
place indeed for Bong Joon-
ho. After global warming freezes
Earth to death, lucky survivors
on a miracle train that repeatedly
travels round and round the globe,
are stuck in this perpetual cycle
and the harsh class division the
train enforces on its passengers.
The rich enjoy all the luxuries
near the front of the train, where
the poor are forced to survive
amongst themselves in horrendous
conditions.
But it’s time for the passengers of
the back to rise up. United under
the reluctant leader in the form of
Curtis (Chris Evans), they plan a
day of uprising to overthrow the
unfair, violent rule of the rich
that is imposed on them. The aim
is to get to the very front of the
train, take control of the engine
room, and come face-to-face with
Wilford (Ed Harris), the man
who built this train. Whilst the
train serves as a vessel of survival
away from the freezing cold of
the outside world, the conditions
inside as it is soon revealed to us,
are not all that much better.
There are striking, unsettling
similarities with what goes on
inside this train with what is
happening right now in our
world. The extreme wealth gap,
violence against the weak, greed
for resources, the list goes on and
on. The struggle experienced at the
back of the train is very extremely
portrayed, with no sugar-coating
of any kind, whereas the lavish
display of what goes on near the
front is quite the uncomfortable
spectacle. Curtis and his gang are
completely stripped of colours,
only introduced to bright shades
and lively ambiance as they slowly
but surely make progress with the
revolution.
This is the most complex role
Chris Evans has ever had, and
he comes off convincingly as a
conflicted leader, unwittingly
thrown to the front of the
movement. Octavia Spencer
shows she is one mother figure
not to cross, as her character’s
determination to find her son gives
her an insane drive and a fiery
spark and strength like no other.
John Hurt is a man of few words
but with important information to
share, and with Ed Harris, the two
make up the classic “wise old men”
characters who know more than
they let on, hugely contributing
to the film’s overall narrative arc,
despite not having long individual
roles.
The excellent cast from the
West is joined by Korean actors
Song Kang-ho and Ko Ah-sung,
who serve as the key plot device
for the film to progress into more
exciting, dangerous territories.
There is quirky humour in their
performances, something that
comes as a welcome distraction
from the otherwise very damp,
depressing mood.
Tilda Swinton, always the
excellent scene-stealer in whatever
movie she is in, does exactly that,
as the eccentric Minister Mason.
The steam and energy fizzle off
towards the end. But there is no
doubting that Snowpiercer is a
thought-provoking, often shocking,
unsettling film that covers a hell of
a lot in its running time.
