FRIDAY 20 JUN

BOOBS! CAN
WE EVER GET
ENOUGH OF
THEM?
A R T I C L E
ACTUALLY 90%
IMAGES
HANGMAN KNOWS YOU CAN’T HANDLE TOO MANY
WORDS
NO!!!!!! That would be really
stupid. As it stands, a mere
50% of the population has
them, maybe they would be
boring to continually expose
and discuss if 100% had
them.
Listen, men have
absolutely no idea about
boobs whatsoever, the only
way they can realistically
be educated about them is
through constant societal
obsession.
Anyway, aren’t they great?
I mean, just think of their
potential to feed small
children. If that doesn’t
justify judging people on
their breast size, then I
simply don’t know what
does.
And check out these
pictures, sure they look a bit
like boobs when you’re only
glancing, but really they’re a
sand dune, whilst the other
is actually a mushroom.
How unfulfilling was that?
No, there must be breasts
and they must be regularly
and consistently distributed
throughout all publications
and media outlets.
It’s the only common
sense view.
KNOWING full well that you
couldn’t possibly handle long
blocks of text, no matter how
well written or entertaining,
Hangman brings you an article
that is 90% images. These can
be seen above and, although
they don’t quite say a thousand
words like a lot of images
can, they are at least bright
and colourful. They’re also
extremely easy to interpret and
add absolutely nothing to your
knowledge of the world. That’s
probably for the best.
