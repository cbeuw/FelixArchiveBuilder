GOAL
Late last night England’s chances
of qualifying for the next round
of the FIFA World Cup went from
optimistic to pretty slim. Their
chances of qualifying for the
next round now depend on Italy
winning their remaining two games
and Uruguay and Costa Rica and
England themselves beating Costa
Rica. Even then the group will come
down to goal difference, of which
England’s is currently worst.
England looked comfortable before Luis
Suarez was given a golden chance to take
the lead in the first half, which he duly took
with a header. Shortly before this Wayne
Rooney, playing in the centre today after
swapping his role with Raheem Sterling,
narrowly missed with a free kick before
hitting the crossbar with a header.

PELOTON
TO PARIS
Triathlon’s Easter Tour
Report
ICU Triathlon
With great trepidation and supposition the brave
fifteen prepared for a two day cycle to Paris;
an Arch to Arc ride through Southern English
countryside to promised celestial heights of
French tarmac. In pensive preparation for the
challenge ahead many members settled into
a relaxing night of partying in central London,
while others relaxed to an evening of car hunting
and bag loading until the early hours of the night.
And after a restful two hours of sleep it was time
to depart for Marble Arch.
In great style everyone arrived precisely for the 4:00am meet; a
semblance for times to come. The chilled darkness of Marble
Arch endorsed a frosty air of great expectation.

ICU DANCE COMPANY
We took 7 dance teams to compete in four
different categories - ballet, tap, jazz and
contemporary in advanced and beginners
categories. We have never before entered so
many categories/taken so many of our club
members on tour before. This was a fantastic
opportunity for our members to showcase
their dancing abilities to a large audience in a
competitive environment. We competed against
a total of 15 different universities from across
the UK and were successful in placing in 3 of the
categories.
