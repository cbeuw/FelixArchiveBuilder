FRIDAY 20 JUN NEWS
Continued from Page 1
over the circumstances after
the mistake had been discovered.
According to one student, once
the invigilators had realised
there was a problem, they did
not immediately collect all of the
question papers. In fact, whilst
the invigilators discussed their
course of action, the students
chatted about the exam paper
and the answers (which they still
had at this point) with their peers
for approximately ten minutes.
The College’s claim that students
would not have been able to use
“the information to any advantage”
is therefore questionable.
Furthermore, when the new
question papers were provided,
the students were not forced to
use new answer booklets, meaning
that those who managed to copy
down answers or hints before the
question paper was removed could
have gained an advantage.
Another dimension of the
situation involved the students
who had extra time to complete
the paper. Operating Systems
was part B of a two-part module
that also included Computer
Architecture. This was sat in the
morning and was then followed
by a 30-minute break before Part
B (the one with the mark scheme
present). However, as the extra
time students finished Part A,
the other students had returned
from their break, meaning that
the students who were eligible to
receive extra time were present for
the mishap, and were able to listen
to or take part in the discussion
of the paper and answers before
taking their break, in which they
could potentially study the topics
they knew were on the exam.
Having looked at the relevant
documents, it would appear that
the entire module, represented by
papers A and B, is worth 7.5% of
the first year EIE course.
When speaking to Felix about
the exam paper, another student
said, “[the department] wrongly
thought we couldn’t extrapolate
the answers from the mark scheme
so it was probably wrong for the
exam to go ahead”.
Felix feels that it is unfair to
unduly criticise the staff for a simple
mistake.
However we believe that the
students should be informed in
more detail about any repercussions,
and that the overall situation could
have been handled significantly
better when it first arose.
As a group of representatives
of the Student’s Unions and
Associations of the Russell Group,
you would expect them to be
doing, well something. With an
empty website and empty promises
of meeting at least 6 times a year,
rumours have been spreading
amongst the twittersphere that the
group may be disbanding.
When approached to comment
on the situation, or really lack
of situation, the Aldwych group
declined to reply, which makes us
wonder whether there’s actually
anyone at the other end of the
computer.
The pristinely made website that
has pretty much no content apart
from a long list of bullet points
about the Constitution along with
no press releases, new updates
or events, its no wonder that the
group may be scrapped and sold
for parts.
Perhaps the Aldwych group will
step up its game with the new
prospect of Oxford joining the
non-NUS affiliates club or perhaps
they’ll do what they are good at
doing, which is nothing.
Either way, it’s clear that this
group either need to step up their
game or step out of the game.
