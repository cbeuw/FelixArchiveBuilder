FELIX GAMING REVIEW –
Editors: Maximilian Eggl, Calum Skene games.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Felix news
The games editorial team can now
exclusively reveal that the Felix
news section would be much better
if there was a heavier focus on
gaming news. Recent articles in the
game section garnered a lot of views,
and there were several calls for the
current games editor to be instated
as news editor. In fact, the current
Editor-in-Chief remarked: “I really
like gaming, gaming is fun.”, which
seems to suggest he supports the
idea of a change at the helm of the
front page of Imperial’s newspaper.
There seems to also be suggestions
of a redesign of the felix logo as seen
on the right, with a public poll to
take place to choose the right one.
Felix Comment
The discussion for this article is
whether the comment section
would be better with a heavier
focus on gaming. While currently
the comment section is quite
boring, discussing inane topics
like philosophy and communism,
a larger influence from the
interesting area of gaming would
certainly increase readership in this
old-fashioned section. In fact, the
current Editor-in-Chief remarked:
“I really like gaming, gaming is
fun.”, once again suggesting a shake
up in the current set up of the
comment section. I myself would
be quite satisfied if this happened,
and would certainly contribute.
Felix Science
A recent scientific paper published
in the prestigious journal Gamure
that suggests that the science section
is boring, and would be much
better if gaming was given a more
prominent position. This could
include the science of how shooting
barrels and/or respawns. This last
issue in particular has wide-ranging
consequences and could result in
immortality. In fact, the current
Editor-in-Chief remarked: “I
really like gaming, gaming is fun.”,
suggesting he as well is inclined
to introduce a gaming focus into
science, thus making this section
more relevant for the Imperial
college of Science an Technology.
Felix Arts
Having recently visited the gaming
exhibition at earls court, including
modern artists like EA van Gogh
and Leonardo Di Activision, has
really opened my eyes to gaming
as an art form. The pieces like
Call of Duty were insightful and
really commented on our current
social and economical situation. I,
therefore, call for the Felix Editor
who recently said, “I really like
gaming, gaming is fun.” to shake
up the dusty art section and actual
get people reading it. This change
could include instating the games
editor as arts editor, as well as
featuring interesting art (gaming)
reviews.
Felix Music
The latest album GTA V by
genre-spanning rockstars Rockstar
studios has been an absolute
success. The music throughout
the entirety of this work really
is entertaining and spans the
entire spectrum of emotion. It
allows you to let your anger free
and really roam the wide world
it creates. Now read again, you
read a gaming review. Admit it,
you loved it. Therefore I suggest
that we model music more on the
gaming section, with a heavier
focus on gaming. This idea is also
supported by the current editor-
in-chief who said: “I really like
gaming, gaming is fun.”
Felix Film
This lengthy section, almost like
the films it review, would certainly
benefit from a snappier first person
gaming approach. Controlling the
characters would convey emotion
and thus giving this section a
much needed readership boost. In
addition the Felix editor himself
said: “I really like gaming, gaming
is fun.”
Felix Tech
The tech section is the worst
section of them all. Maximilian
Eggl, current technology section
editor said: “It’s completely
shit, we only review apple stuff
anyway.” Us from the gaming
section have no clear solution
for this lack of quality due to
the fact that even doing more
gaming related material would
not increase the quality of this
section. What we do suggest
is scrapping the tech section
completely and introducing
a section namely gaming-
technology, with Maximilian
Eggl, current gaming section
editor, as its chief.
Felix Food
Sandwich à la Gaming:
2 x pieces of bread
1 x piece of ham
2 x salad leaves
3 x tomatoes
Mayonaise
Firstly toast the bread until it is
crunchy, and then slowly add the
mayonaise to each side. Next very
carefully cut the tomatoes into halves
and arrange them symmetrically
on one of the pieces of toast. Then
forcefully throw the salad on the
toast, and finish off with slapping
the ham on, and then smacking the
two pieces together. Voilà you know
have perfect gaming snack food
Gaming would be
better
