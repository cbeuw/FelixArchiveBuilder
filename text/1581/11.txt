Deputy President
(Education)
Deputy President
(Finance & Services)
Felix Editor
IC School of
Medicine SU
President
Best thing you’ve done this year?
Definitely going to the top education
committee- the College Senate- and
winning a debate on why we shouldn’t
switch to GPA (Grade Point Average).
Having most of the senior members of
College on the opposing side meant this
victory for students was even sweeter.
What are your top four favourite
colours and why?
Well dur- obviously cyan, magenta,
black and white. Because these are the
only 4 colours that exist. Aren’t they??
Top points for loving Union branding colours! – I
would admit to it to if I could. Ed.
What you wish you’d known when
you started?
The Union is very well respected by and
has a strong relationship with College.
This is very useful when making change
and getting things done and I wish I’d
utilised this more sooner.
How often do you eat at
FiveSixEight?
I eat in 568 more than I should but
I think, or at least hope, it’s less than
once a week! We’ve added a lot of new
things this year and I try to make sure I
try everything new at least once.
What you wish you’d known when
you started?
I wish I had known just many emails
I would receive from random PR
companies. And also how hard it can
be to manage a large team. It’s been a
fun year and real learning experience.
How often do you eat at
FiveSixEight?
I’ve reduced the frequency of my visits
this term, but at times I’ve been every
day of the week. I’ve probably spent
over £1000 there over the course of the
year (not including drinks). Talk about
giving back to the Union! Great place!
What have you been doing for the
last year?
I’ve spent my year pulling my hair out
at how many events the Medical School
puts on and trying to ensure that no
one dies. It’s all in the role of a medical
sabbatical.
How often do you eat at
FiveSixEight?
I only eat at FiveSixEight when Kieron
is paying. He’s very generous with
his hard earned wages. They should
probably name a burger after him... Or
at least after RSM hockey.
Best thing you’ve done this year?
Working with EESoc and setting up
coding classes where students can teach
children how to code.
Why did you run for the role?
I want to improve the feedback system,
implement e-learning across the college
and enhance the PG experience.
What is your favourite “Cards
Against Humanity Card”?
Money can’t buy me love, but it can
buy me peanut butter jelly time
What is your favourite floor of the
Union and why?
Level 1, no stairs
What are you looking forward to
the most?
After this year, I think the thing I’m
looking forward to most is seeing even
more bits of the Union I’ve never
encountered and the interesting things
they get up to and events they run.
What is your favourite “Cards
Against Humanity Card”?
I’m ashamed to say that I only
encountered this this year. My nerd
credentials are slipping. I did enjoy it...
though some pretty terrible things crop
up. I don’t think I have a favourite card
but Step 1. _____, Step 2. _____, Step 3.
Profit is an old classic.
What are your plans for next
year?
I plan to make Felix the student paper
of the year, and ensure it wins a shit
tonne of awards for student media. I’m
also looking at long term plans to install
a cocktail bar into the Felix Office,
for the inevitable Wednesday night
breakdowns.
What’s your favourite thing about
Metric?
The senseless apathy that you have to
induce within yourself to have a good
time there. For me, that takes about six
pints and two tequila shots. Nothing
more, nothing less. Also requesting
the Fly Like a G6 parody “Fly like its
Quiddich” every time I go and being
told to do one.
What have you been doing over
the last year?
Delivering babies, offering
contraception advice and attempting to
entertain 4 year olds in an allergy clinic.
Oh, and making sure that Imperial’s
most decorated rugby club made some
money. #whowinsatvarsity
What’s your favourite thing about
Metric?
The Exit!
