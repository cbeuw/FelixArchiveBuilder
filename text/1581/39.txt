FELIX’S FAVOURITE ANONYMOUS EDITORS EXPLORE
THEIR HIDDEN DESIRES
After a disappointing response to Annie’s propositioning in last week’s Catnip, she found
herself alone and upset one evening in the Felix office this week. When Hangman found
her this way, he decided to cheer her up by taking her on what
she thought would be a romantic(ish) date.
Hand in hand, they strolled down High Street Kensington
heading to what Hangman has said was his favourite
restaurant, known for both its excellent cuisine and reasonable
prices. The location? McDonald’s. As Annie is a poor student,
she decided it was acceptable. Getting inside, Hangman had
conveniently “forgotten” his wallet, and when Annie offered to
pay, he immediately ordered the most expensive thing on the
menu. After ordering her own food, Hangman told Annie that
she was too fat, and ate her burger in the hopes that this would
be the beginning of a diet, as well as eating half her chips.
This was nothing, however, compared to Hangman’s behaviour. Not only was he
obnoxious and rude, he spent the entire meal making terrible jokes (see page 42 for
examples of this). The worst was when he began making predictions for their future, all
which seemed to end with Annie’s violent and untimely death. Overall, it was the worst
date that Annie had ever been on.
The sex was okay though.
Agony Aunt Annie Whiteley, 43, lives in Hammersmith, and likes kittens, sappy romance
novels, and hardcore BDSM on the weekends.
Hangman, 20, lives in Fulham, and likes bad rap music, racism, and puns.
