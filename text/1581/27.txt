Clearly, old men in action films is
a popular trend these days, thanks
to Liam Neeson’s unprecedented
success with the Taken franchise,
that currently has its third film in
production. Kevin Costner tries
to copy the success of Neeson in
the form of a career revival, with
Luc Besson, the influential figure
behind Taken, penning the script.
The result is a mixed bag; Costner
certainly has what it takes to pull
off a potential franchise, but the
film is so cliched and all over the
place that a well-assembled cast is
not fully utilised.
From the get go this is not
something to be taken seriously.
Ethan Renner (Costner) is
only given months to live after
Tammy (4th July)
Transformers (5th July)
HTTYD2 (11th July)
Hercules (25th July)
Guardians of the Galaxy (31st July)
The Inbetweeners 2 (6th August)
Lucy (22nd August)
a malignant cancer spreads to
his lungs. And it’s this bleak
prognosis that the CIA decides
to take advantage of. Vivi Delay
(Amber Heard), one of CIA’s elite
assassins, is tasked with hunting
down the Wolf (Richard Sammel),
a mysterious, illusive criminal
who needs to be caught for some
reason. She makes a deal with the
terminal Ethan. Do this one last
job, and the CIA will provide him
with a new experimental drug that
could cure his condition.
When he is not being shot at
by foreign agents and potential
terrorists, Ethan is having
problems at home too. His
estranged daughter Zoey (Hailee
Steinfeld) who he never paid too
much attention to, does not even
call him “dad” but instead by his
first name. His ex-wife Christine
(Connie Nielsen) is also tired of
her husband’s demanding job.
Throughout the film, 3 Days to
Kill has the constant urge to try to
balance two very distinct aspects to
the story, never quite succeeding
in make one side as good as the
other. The thrilling action scenes
get it exactly right. McG, last
seen directing the underrated,
much underseen This is War, has
a good grasp of using Costner, a
seasoned, veteran actor who looks
comfortable in his role. He looks
as though he’s been doing this for
years, successfully pulling off his
scruffy, grumpy look.
The script, co-written by Adi
Hasak and Luc Besson, manages
to take its time to place some
off-beat humour into many of its
implausible situations, almost in
a self-mocking sort of way, which
turns out to be an unexpected
surprise in the best possible way.
It hits a definite low point once
it starts focusing on the women
surrounding Ethan’s personal
and professional life. There is
absolutely nothing new about the
broad, thin characterisation of the
film’s wife/daughter roles and the
film doesn’t quite know what to
do with Amber Heard, who just
pops up whenever she feels like
it, in her fancy car, flirting with
Ethan occasionally, giving him his
new mission, then disappearing for
another significant portion of the
film.
Sadly despite Costner’s leading
man efforts, there isn’t a franchise
potential here. But as a one-off,
mindless bit of entertainment, it
gets its job done, just like most
things handled by Besson.
