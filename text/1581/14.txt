New research has shown that
men watching more violence on
television could result in stunted
in brain development, and the
inability to control impulsive
behaviours, including aggression.
Astudy,ranbyatopbrainjournal,
used brain imaging techniques to
measure the mental abilities and
volumes of key brain regions for a
group of men, specifically chosen
due to the fact that they don’t play
video games but still watch TV.
The young men kept a diary of
what they watched on the TV for
a week, and completed further
psychological tests to measure
memory, attention and inhibitory
control.
It was found that the more violent
TV viewing the men indulged in,
the more likely they were to be
less attentive, and were less able to
control their cognitive function.
Not only that, but there appeared
to be an actual structural difference
in the brains of those that enjoyed
the violent content of television
shows.
Lead author Tom A. Hummer,
Ph.D., assistant research professor
intheIUDepartmentofPsychiatry,
said of the study: “When we
looked at the brain scans of young
men with higher violent television
exposure, there was less volume of
white matter connecting the frontal
and parietal lobes, which can be
a sign of less maturity in brain
development.”
White matter of the brain
insulates and protects nerve fibres,
they allow different parts of the
brain to connect and interact with
each other. Usually, this white
matter volume increases as the
brain makes more connections
throughout development, up
until the age of around 30. These
connections are important for
executive functioning of the
brain, which includes formulating
plans, make decisions, reason and
problem solve.
“The take-home message
from this study is the finding
of a relationship between how
much violent television we
watch and important aspects of
brain functioning like controlled
attention and inhibition,” Dr.
Hummer said.
People who spend more time
sitting are more at risk of getting
cancer than people who don’t, a
new study reveals.
We already knew that sitting
is linked to diabetes and heart
disease, but our sedentary
lifestyles are now even more
dangerous than we thought.
Scientists looked at thousands
of cancer studies and found that
the risk for three specific cancers,
bowel, endometrial (womb lining)
and lung, is much greater when
you sit down, like you do in the
office or when watching TV.
In the studies, the least amount
of time spent sitting was two
to three hours. Every two-hour
increase in sitting time from this
was linked to an eight percent
increased risk of bowel cancer
and a ten percent increased risk
of endometrial cancer.
At least sitting doesn’t increase
the risks for other cancers.
But even if you work out
regularly, you can’t get rid of
the increased risk of bowel,
endometrial and lung cancer.
Only spending less time on your
bottom will help prevent them.
THIS research was carried out as
a ‘meta analysis’, as it took data
from previous studies to draw new
conclusions. Pooled data was taken
from 43 studies with more than four
million participants, and covered
more than 70,000 cancer cases.
“Cutting down on TV viewing
and sedentary time is just as
important as becoming more
active,” said Daniela Schmid, one
of the authors of the study. “For
those whose jobs require them to
sit at a desk most of the day, we
recommend breaking up the time
spent sitting by incorporating
short bouts of light activity into
the daily routine,” she added.
So next time you switch on your
screens to watch the World Cup,
don’t take a seat – take a stand.
