FRIDAY 20 JUN
18 COMMENT
I’ve been calling myself a feminist for
about 10 years, and I started doing so
for a simple reason – I believe women
and men should be treated equally.
I was not going to pretend not to be
something because it might make
others around me more comfortable.
Just to be sure, I looked up ‘feminism’
in the Oxford dictiona§§ry, “The advocacy
of women’s rights on the ground of the
equality of the sexes.” I wish it were a
concept so obvious it didn’t need a name,
but we live in a world where rape is used
as a weapon of war; where infant girls are
killed because their parents wanted a boy;
where girls are denied education, and the
multitude of other little inequalities that
grind down our daily lives. I will continue
to call myself a feminist, because to get
anywhere near equality more needs to be
done.
I was mocked by female friends at school
for expressing “radical” feminist opinions,
such as, “why does that have to be pink?”
or “are we going to learn about any female
scientists?”, or “why aren’t we telling the
boys not to rape?” Without fail, those who
mocked all call themselves feminists now,
after a brief stint in the real world.
Perhaps they still call themselves
feminists because they’ve not engaged in
“online feminism”, a warped world where
words no-one has heard of before appear
at an alarming rate. It bores me. It annoys
me. But it doesn’t stop me calling myself a
feminist. In fact, it doesn’t stop me being
Chair of the society.
Portraying feminism as a monolithic
force, where everyone thinks the same is
a bit disingenuous. There’s never been
a coherent feminist movement. It has
never existed. From the splits between the
suffragettes and the suffragists in the early
20th century to the controversy of the
Spice Girls’ use of Girl Power in the 1990’s.
Feminists are going to disagree. There are
rather of lot of people who want gender
equality, we don’t all sit in a room with
an agenda and decide on strategy. By the
way, the gays don’t either – there is no gay
agenda, just equality.
Although there are arguments for
different terms being more socially
acceptable or less divisive, ultimately in-
fighting is not action and surrendering
the identity of a movement because it
is deemed unpopular not only doesn’t
bode well for the rest of your movement’s
principles but it also doesn’t make sense.
It’s not the combination of letters or
sounds in the word ‘feminism’ that people
have a problem with, and changing the
word doesn’t change how the backlash to
feminism is a reaction to the redistribution
of power gender equality would ultimately
require, not because some online activism
is inaccessible. It’s only a matter of time
before ‘ugh those feminists’ becomes
‘ugh those humanists/egalitarians/gender
equalists’.
I’m proud to call myself a feminist. I’m
proud to campaign to make life easier for
women. We don’t need a new word, we
need more activists from all backgrounds.
Consider this a call to arms: wave your
(borrowed) mooncups proudly, bare your
hairy legs, do whatever you want really,
we’re not picky, just join the cause however
you feel comfortable doing so.
A response from members of the Feminist Society...

Feminist Society 2013-14

I
first remember coming
across the word ‘feminism’
when I was about 9, and
asking my mum what it
meant. “It’s the principle”,
she replied, without even
glancing up from her newspaper,
“that girls and boys should be
treated in exactly the same way”.
I remember thinking it bizarre
that such an obvious concept
even needed a name, but I didn’t
question it any further.
A
s a shy and
body-conscious
teenager walking
to school by
myself, I quickly
realised why.
Men on the street - construction
workers, paramedics out of an
ambulance window! - would wolf-
whistle and hurl abuse at me, and
laugh raucously when I nervously
walked faster and turned up my
Walkman CD player (remember
those?). I’d run out of hands if I
tried to count the number of times
people ‘accidentally’ brushed their
own hands against me on public
transport. My female headmistress
strongly discouraged me from
applying to study science (“what’s
wrong with English, or Spanish?”).
Even now, my grasp of Java is,
apparently, “excellent, for a girl”.
So, determined and spurred on
by a leaflet at the Freshers’ Fair,
I joined a few feminist groups on
Facebook - my first real experience
of Feminism, with a capital F.
I suddenly felt that, despite
having been belittled and harassed
on an almost-daily basis, I knew
next to nothing about what it
was supposed to mean. It wasn’t
a man cat-calling me on my way
to lectures, it was ‘objectification’.
‘Privilege’ took on a specific
meaning quite distinct to its
everyday usage. I was learning new
concepts at a rate unparalleled since
primary school - ‘androcentrism’,
‘intersectionality’, ‘rape culture’,
‘sex-negativity’ (which doesn’t
always, apparently, imply that all
sexuality is bad, merely that ‘the
patriarchy’s’ construction of it and
its focus on ‘PIV’ is ‘misogynistic’).
I eventually plucked up the
courage to dip my toes in the water
and comment on a long thread (just
two posts under a lonely, unliked
call for volunteers to help with a
fundraising event for a domestic
violence charity), questioning
why the content in question was
offensive and whether it was
really intended to be in any way
sexist. “You’re trying to derail this
conversation by education”, came
the terse reply, unhelpfully linking
me to a guide called Derailment
for Dummies. “It’s not our job to
educate you. Besides, it doesn’t
matter whether they knew they
were being sexist or not.”
I’m sure the reply was well-
intentioned. And I’m sure most
people who call themselves
‘feminists’ would have given a
longer and more informative
response. But the thought stuck
- if feminists were capable of
making me, a keen, reasonably
well-educated victim of sexist
behaviours, feel alienated and
uncomfortable, what hope does
the movement have in convincing
those who don’t even believe in
equality, especially those who
aren’t open and willing to swallow
a dictionary of new words?
And, regardless of the
argumentative style, the word
‘feminism’ itself is now so
polarising as to make the associated
discussion completely useless.
“I’m a feminist” will win you
instant feminist cookies from the
20% of Americans who identify as
such, but is completely and utterly
counter-productive when trying to
explain to our target audience - the
very people who are senselessly
sexist - why their behaviour is
wrong. “Check your privilege” is, at
best, likely to earn you a quizzical
look from all except the minority
who’re already intimately familiar
with the concept of male privilege.
Trying to explain to a group
of men why their conversation
makes me feel uncomfortable is
already difficult enough without
having to simultaneously defend
myself against allegations of being
an angry lesbian man-hater and
repeatedly explaining the details
of the strawfeminist fallacy. I
don’t care what the construction
workers wolf-whistling me think of
feminism (much as I’d like them
to have respect for the first-wave
feminist suffragettes who fought
for the right to vote). “I’m no
feminist”, I’ll say instead, instantly
capturing everyone’s attention,
“and I know you mean well, but
your conversation makes me feel
scared and uncomfortable.”
And I don’t seem to be the only
one to hold this view. One of the
‘Feminist’ pages I followed linked
to an article listing celebrities’
“misguided” reasons to decry
feminism. Bjork, Beyoncé, Taylor
Swift, Madonna, Geri Halliwell;
the list goes on - all role models
to millions of young women, who,
for one reason or another, have felt
the need to distance themselves
from the F-word. “I can’t believe
it, I’m so angry”, said one of the
comments. “How can all these
celebrities have completely
misunderstood what feminism is?”
The truth is, they haven’t.
Modern-day, ‘third-wave’,
feminism isn’t seen as a welcoming
and all-accepting movement
(though undoubtedly many
feminists are, and the original
tenet still holds; modern feminism
encompasses a hugely greater
number of beliefs and dogmas in
addition to the simple plight for
equality). The F-word instantly
conjures up not-entirely-untrue
images of an élitist, infighting and
hopelessly idealistic group. A co-
ordinated movement was useful
years ago to provide a unified
front to change laws; but today,
we’re trying to change attitudes -
a much more difficult goal - and
flying under the outdated and
divisive banner of ‘feminism’ is
actively destructive to the cause.
Identifying as a ‘feminist’ - or
indeed an ‘equalist’ or ‘humanist’
or any other ‘ist’ - provides an
easy ground for stereotyping and
strawman arguments. When trying
to win over others, standing on your
own two feet is much, much more
powerful than bandying around a
word which is just another thing to
argue against.
We live in a world where just
23% of American women identify
as feminist; where several major
female role models have come out
against feminism, and even where
a member of Imperial’s WSET
Society committee came out a few
years ago and said (albeit opposed
to the current official policy of the
group) that they ‘have no place or
tolerance for feminism’.
Perhaps, rather than smugly
attacking and critiquing all these
people, it’s time for the Feminist
community to take a good long
look at the image it (correctly
or not) portrays to the average
person on the street. And to cut
out alienating feminist jargon,
to be willing to make pragmatic
short-term compromises for long-
term idealistic goals, and to ditch
the toxic, divisive, and outdated
F-word once and for all.
O
r, at least, to have
respect for those
of us who make
the informed
decision not to
use it.
