FRIDAY 20 JUN CLUBS & SOCS
Endless twisting roads.
I kept running, ever
conscious of the footsteps
behind me, its march
keeping to the drumbeat of
my heart.
I took a left, almost falling
from skidding on the
torrential downpour.
Tap.
Tap.
Tap.
After my recent submission
to a collection curated by messrs
McIntosh and Bergen, I took my
leave for Bruges. I had heard much
of the Belgian air’s restorative effects,
and I was tired from my studies,
and so I found myself but 3 days
ago leaving the comfortable bosom
of London for the continent. The
journey was largely uneventful,
although I found myself attempting
to leave the train at Aalter, as if in
a trance, unthinkingly taking my
luggage and walking to the door. I
came to as I had nearly stepped out,
and returned to my seat. I now wish
I had not, and allowed whatever
providence to succeed in its attempt
to save me.
Upon reaching Bruges, I
attempted to find my lodging, a
small boarding house near one of
the city gates. I had procured a map
while in London, but none of the
streets seemed to quite match, and
were named differently when they
did. I walked at least one circle of the
maze, the trudging of my feet like a
shambling chant, walking out some
kind of prayer to be shown rest. But
as that thought crossed my mind,
the architecture yielded, and it was
before me, where surely it was not
before.
I checked into the hotel, and
went for a simple dinner in the
small square a short walk away. The
mussels were delicious, the escargot
divine, the beer rich and dark.The
streets, previously desolate and
foreboding, were now filled with
all kinds of people, bustling and
scurrying to avoid the rain, suddenly
pouring from the sky as it was. I idly
watched them to and fro, before the
sky darkened, the rain stopped, and
they disappeared. I paid and left,
and found myself stood on a bridge
looking out over one of the many
canals, and shuddered. The river,
its black mass seething and writhing
beneath, gurgling as if digesting
its last
victim, hungry. Even though it
has no eyes, I knew it watched me
pass. It watched, and I shuddered,
with something even more primal
than fear, something that left me
transfixed, held as if by the hand
of God Himself, if such a thing can
even exist in the face of this... thing
below. By the time I returned to
my body and came to my senses,
the shadow in the water was gone.
I stumbled back to my lodgings,
shaken.
The day that followed was
agreeable, visiting local collections
and enjoying delicacies. The rain left
me soaked as I walked, and I often
found myself at a loss attempting to
comprehend the geometry of the
place, but suddenly it was refreshing,
almost comforting in a way I can’t
quite describe but felt so assuredly.
There was one moment of unease,
however.Withinacollectiondevoted
to showcasing local produce, I came
upon a scene of such macabre
intentions I can barely comprehend.
A vision of a man consuming
his own flesh, as if overcome by
madness, not for want of food, but
of such warped senses as to find it
appetizing. Next to them, a woman
offered up her child, like a basket of
delicious fruits, insane and twisted.
Confused and
unsettled, I moved on into the safety
of the rain. I woke the following
morning, packed my things, said
my goodbyes, and started toward
the station. I inevitably found myself
lost, the maddening layout mocking
me as I walked in circles again. I
could not even try to ask a local for
guidance, as the streets were once
more empty. After an hour of this,
the sun beating down on me, I tried
to stop for a lunch, or perhaps one
of the Trappist brews, but found no-
where open. A bell tolled in the near
distance, hidden behind the walls of
this maze, so close and yet obscured
and concealed. I turned, looked at
my map, turned again.
Everywhere, a winding
road of esoteric yet uniform
architecture, devoid of any
kind of life. “Gieterijstraat”,
“ W i t t e l e e r t o u w e s s t r a a t ” ,
“Minderbroederstraat”, the language
as arcane as the streets themselves,
seemingly assembled without form
or reason. It was at this point that I
knew. The city had caught me, and
now it was simply playing.
I walked and walked, growing tired
and hungry. I longed for the rain, to
coolmeinthesunandasreassurance
that time was truly passing. But with
it came the footsteps. When I first
heard them, I felt joy, but it soon
turned to terror as I saw what was
making them, for I had seen it in the
eyes of the man feasting on himself.
I turned and ran. The footsteps
followed, with a slow yet constant
pacing, never matching my speed
but always growing closer. I ran and
it followed, waiting for me to tire and
fall.
The rain lifted, and with it went
the footsteps. I was safe, of a kind,
but just as trapped as before. I rested
for a few moments, before stumbling
forward in hope of finding a gate
before the rain returned, my body
aching.
But it rained again. And again,
and again, through day and night. I
do not know how many frozen cold
wet nights I ran for. It never quite
reached me, but it was often close,
its scent lingering, mixing with my
own newfound smell of decay. Even
though I knew there was no exit
from this foul place, I kept running,
hope alone keeping me mobile.
Days turned to weeks, and I
collapsed, exhausted and starving,
not even having the strength to fear
anymore. I willed it to catch me, to
consume me through myself.
When the rain came that time, I
did not hear the footsteps.
I am told I spent only 3 days
abroad, although they will admit
I looked somehow aged. I escaped
with my life, but I am less sure of my
soul, and know I have lost my mind.
My nurse chatters to herself as she
tidies my bedsheets and nightstand.
I pick at my skin and start to salivate.
