Six quality sides took the field last

ous games met Coults A F C . The
game was hard but Chelsea turned

goal by Dr. Coults sealed a 3-0 tri-
umph for The Blues. Cheers to
everyone w h o took part &. espe-
cially the organisers. Yous done
well!
Best of
mates
Last week the Chess Club's 1st
team scored another win at home
against Harrow, avenging last sea-
son's disastrous draw.
Harrow's top boards included
two International Masters. IC's
Jon Hastings was horribly savaged
until I M Colin Crouch blundered
like a novice. Paul G e o r g h i o u
resigned but spent hours trying to
convince everyone he ought to
have w o n .
Natasha Regan's o p p o n e n t
forked her rooks a n d Nick
Moloney sank into a safe draw.
Gavin Knott set a pretty trap for his
opponent, w h o obliged and lost
his queen. Chris Greenshields
resorted to c h o m p i n g bananas; his
opponent s o o n lost the plot of the
game. Patrick Duncan was pitted
against "the most boring player
ever". Exasperated, he accepted a
draw. Harrow's captain appeared
to have Dave Tang tied in knots at
first, but Dave's superior skills told
eventually.
The final score of 5-3 gives the
team 7/7 for the season so far,
making them almost certain to
tetain the M i d d l e s e x League
Championship for the third year
running.
The C h e s s Club is h o s t i n g
weekend tournaments o n 8 and
21-22 February. All standards of
player are w e l c o m e . Contact Barry

St. George's were our opponents
as w e braved - 5 winds to embark
in our first match of the season.
M a t c h fitness proved to be less
of a problem than first anticipated,
although Hedge had warned us to
give the all important 200%.
The first goal was a while a
while c o m i n g although w e had all
the pressure; Lili the powerhouse
(Why's our leccy bill so high then?
- ed.) struck the ball low into the
back of the net. She scored again
within a few minutes with another
impressive strike as the 3 sup-
posed strikers floundered.
W e started the 2nd half 2 nil
up fx with several more layers on
to try fx fight the nipple hardening
cold (spectator sport?). Again w e
had all the pressure &. eventually
Taffy stuck home - the first of the
three strikers to score. This was
followed by the ' H o o d e d Yank',
Anna, w h o broke her duck on her
debut.
Scrubber missed around 15 sit-
ters ix it was all looking rather
embarrassing until she eventually
scored w h e n a nice Greek bird put
her clear through with seven min-
utes to go.
The back three were never real-
ly troubled with M a r k h u s ,
Wannabe Yank Vasso fx Sick Bird
Hacker ensuring only one goal
passed their dainty bodies (or was
that a mistake by frost-bitten keep-
er Langrish?).
Well done birds. O n to the
Semis!

IC II V KINGSTON II
Last year IC seconds qualified in
the inferior BUSA Shield, went to
Leicester and lost eleven - nil. This
year, the seconds had performed
heroically in the league stage and
qualified for the superior cup c o m -
petition. Despite the daunting task
ahead of us, the seconds were ready
for our opponents, Kingston. N o w was
the time for redemption.
With the referee needing to be resusci-
tated before the match, both teams
waited pensively for the kick-off. The ini-
tial signs looked bad, with Kingston
stroking the ball about with gusto and IC
looking a bit panicked. After five minutes
of mutual probing, IC broke from the
back. Si received the ball on the halfway-
line, turned and ran at the Kingston
defence. They backed away and backed
away, leaving him the chance to have a
crack from a few yards outside the area.
The goalie managed to get a hand to the
shot but it wasn't enough as the ball flew
into the back of the net.
The game continued at a blis-
tering pace with Kingston probing
us gently but with our defence in
control. Minutes after the first goal,
a g o o d break d o w n the left saw
M a r t i n bearing d o w n o n goal.
Despite an angle, our Tiny Tyneside
Tyke slotted the ball away at the
near post. Two-nil up and IC were
playing their hearts out.
Despite the teams being very
close in terms of skill, IC's c o m m i t -
ment meant that Kingston were
always on the back foot. N o t
renowned for their battling quali-
ties, the seconds pulled something
special out of the hat and were first
to every ball in the first half, were
harder in the challenge than their
South London rivals and altogether
m u c h harder than the, at face
value, physically stronger bods
from Kingston.
A m o d i c u m of egality w a s
attained for around ten minutes,
but another IC move saw Pistol
Pete charging one-on-one towards
the Kingston goal. From a similar
position to Martin, our Gaelic Goal-
Machine buried the ball into the net
and broke Kingston's hearts. Three-
nil at half time and things were
looking up.
The second half was more even
for the first half an hour, with
Kingston reducing the deficit to
t w o . But with Rob at central
defence winning every header and
tackle they couldn't find another
and as the match wore on IC found
more and more space to break.
The match was finally sealed
fifteen minutes from time with
another Pistol Pete goal. They all
count, and despite the fact that it
was from one yard out, surely this
was the most ptecious goal Pete
has scored all season.
Particular mention must go to
Andy Ferguson w h o managed to
combine defensive fortitude with
attacking class and for Stevie C
w h o stepped into the breach after
Phil The Pill's bizarre domestic
accident put him out of action.
So, Captain Loz leads an IC
football t e a m into the s e c o n d
round of the B U S A cup for the first
time in living m e m o r y . Hurrah!
Thanks also to supersub The
Mighty Robo, c o m i n g out of retire-
ment for one final game.
Elsewhere at Harlington, the
firsts lost to a strong U E A team
despite a classy goal from Spanish
Superstud Alex. A n d to the
fourths...
Astheheadline once said,
"Glory, Glory IC Fourths", so it
proved today with an excellent 2-0
win in the B U S A shield versus
Brunei. A professional perfomance
from the team and a clean sheet
was only marred by a horrific injury
four minutes from time to inspira-
tional C a p t a i n A n d r e w Swift.
Epitomising the whole teams' spir-
it Andy launched into a brave chal-
lenge o n the 6 foot 5 Brunei 'keep-
er. Unfortunately the damage isn't
superficial and Andy wiil be out of
action for a long time. Everyone in
the Fourth Team, and indeed the
whole Club wishes Swift a speedy
recovery and w e all hope he is back
up to full fitness by the start of next
year. As a captain Andy was orgas-
mically magnificent, his team talk
today focused his players minds
and spirits to such an extent that
actually the result was never seri-
ously in doubt. For the record the
goals were scored by Darren and
Perez and I would like to add that 1
didn't get sent off but saved a cru-
cial penalty when the score was nil-
nil. G o o d luck Andy; we'll win the
final for y o u !
Telephone reports from darkest
Wales suggest that the Thirds tri-
u m p h e d 3-2 against their sheep-
shagging opponent at the Swansea
Institute for Guide-Dogs. Rumours
of ginger scousers scoring are as
yet unconfirmed, but if Jamie has
broken his IC duck then we will
never hear the end of it.
ICFC II 4 - 1 Kingston II
