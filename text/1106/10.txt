10 JOHN H EGLEY: GOD? 6th February 1998
" M y dad always told my sister not to
play with her food. He said that carrots
do not make very g o o d friends..."

• Jonathan Trout met "Comedy's Poet Laureate" at the Bloomsbury Theatre before the final show in his highly popular national tour. •
He brought Will Dugdale along to take the pictures and a handful of chocolate eggs for reasons which will become obviousjj
T
he deserted, expectant the-
atre has a strangely charged
feel to it as I perch on the
stage aside John Hegley. Casually
dressed in an open necked,
expensive looking shirt and cream
jeans, his timid, innocent public
persona seemingly belied by his
darting eyes and unshaven chin. I
hand him a coffee, the five
sachets of sugar inspired partly by
knowing, winky irony, partly by
gushing hero worship but mostly
because he might have been seri-
ous in naming his first book "Five
Sugars Please". Typically, as such
situations often turn out, he used
none. Before we started I w o n -
dered if it would be possible to
ask him to think of a p o e m
around the theme "Felix".
HEGLEY: H o w much?
TROUT: just a couple of lines.
HEGLEY: I meant h o w m u c h I
would get paid.
TROUT: I'll give you a Creme Egg
for it.
I duly hand over a Creme Egg. H e
seems surprised, and grateful.
HEGLEY: Yeah? O h , all right.
Cheers mate. That's even before
you've heard it!
TROUT: You get an extra one if
it's decent. Are your p o e m s any
good? Do you think so?
HEGLEY: Erm... [laughs] I've got
to say, that was a very g o o d
opening question... I think that
some of them are. S o m e of them
are even poems. Not many.
TROUT: W h y d o you think people
like you so much? W h y d o y o u
think can you fill a place like this?
HEGLEY: Well, they are accessible,
and people generally d o like poet-
ry, I think there is poetry in lan-
guage; there are lots of phrases in
language which are poetry; a lick
of paint, legs eleven, clickety-
click, people like it.
TROUT: W h e n did y o u realise that
you were destined for greatness,
who was the first person to say
"you're really g o o d , you could d o
something with this?"
HEGLEY: John Peel. W h e n we did
a Peel Session, '83, I remember
that was the turning point, really,
when he said he liked one of our
songs on the radio.
I had watched his show on the
previous Wednesday, in which he
had described his life story previ-
ous to his brush with fame. I
questioned as to whether comic
poetry had been a conscious
career choice:
"It wasn't really, no, it drifted, 'cos
I started out as a singer, and then
started doing some of the words
without the music, so it sort of
drifted towards that."
Mark Radcliffe's evening show on
Radio O n e was instrumental in
Hegley's recent resurgence; I told
him that in a recent interview
[Felix 1093] Radcliffe had pro-
nounced Hegley as one of his
three favourite guests, along with
film buff Mark Kermode and
transatlantic media chick Katie
Puckrick. H e was at first shocked,
and then genuinely m o v e d .
HEGLEY: I didn't know that...
That's fucking great... oh, that is,
I'm so, oh that's really fantastic...
Did he really say that? W o w . . .
[Recovering] Did he mention Nigel
at all?
TROUT: N o , he didn't mention
Nigel [Hegley's silent, miserable
sidekick and guitarist], rude
m a n . . . what do you think that
exposure did for you career?
Obviously, y o u ' d done that earlier
stuff with Peel, but that brought
you into the consciousness of a
whole new set of people.
HEGLEY: Yeah, it's been very
g o o d , actually, in terms of open-
ing it out, bringing in a younger
audience, because I was a bit
bogged d o w n with The Guardian;
1 enjoyed working with The
Guardian and younger people do
read that but it's not hip, not hap-
pening, is it, in that way, So it
really brought in a younger audi-
ence, which is fantastic.
From this g o o d position, I stupidly
asked him h o w his doggie was...
HEGLEY: Well, he's all right. He's
in a plastic bag, a plastic bin liner,
with two others.
[There is an embarrassed pause
as I take my foot from my mouth]
That'll teach y o u . . . [laughs]
Gently diverting the subject (did
he notice? I don't think so...), I
ask w h o his favourite poet is.
HEGLEY: There are a few g o o d
people about, but, what d o you
mean, across the board? If I had
to choose one person's words to
take to a desert island, Elvis
Costello.
TROUT: Were y o u influenced at
all by Ivor Cutler [Glaswegian sur-
realist poet/singer/playwright]
HEGLEY: Ivor Costello, Elvis
Cutler, erm, [mouthful of Creme
Egg] a little I think, yes, not being
afraid to be absurd.
Staying on the poetry theme, I
asked how he dared rhyme "tob-
bogan" with "mahog'un" [see box].
He laughed, then, struggling with
his egg, ignored the question. "I'm
trying to eat this chocolate egg
without getting my thumb on the
bit I'm eating... [then, bizarrely]
...1 was in such a rush to get out
of the house I didn't get to wipe
my arse, it's true...". This was sur-
prisingly hysterical, the three of us
spontaneously falling about.
Whether it was the delivery or just
the full horror of the statement I
know not. After settling d o w n I
continue by asking if, as many a
spite-filled p o e m might suggest,
he really hates his brother-in-law
HEGLEY: N o , not really. But he's
not entirely fictional...
TROUT: H o w m u c h poetry is left
in y o u , d o you think?
HEGLEY: Well the nice thing to
think is that the vessel refills; at
the m o m e n t I hope that there is
about one hour and forty minutes
worth...
TROUT: Were y o u bullied at
