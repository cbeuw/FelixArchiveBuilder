Letters to Felix, Once More Unto the
Polls, Dear Friends
"SORRY" SAY
HOCKEY LADS
Dear (Deidre),
This letter c o m e s from the sin-
cere heart of all the m e m b e r s of
the men's I st hockey t e a m .
It has c o m e to our attention
that there s e e m s to be s o m e ani-
mosity towards the w h o l e t e a m
from other members of the hockey
club. W e were unaware that our
boyish jovialities were causing such
grief. W e were shocked a n d sur-
prised to be accused of being arro-
gant, although w e ' d like to point
out that this is due to high spirits
after g o o d fortunes.
We'd like to apologise profuse-
ly for our actions, and w e hope that
you can find it in your heart to for-
give us. W e cannot, however, make
any promises about our future c o n -
duct.
H o p e this g o e s s o m e w a y
t o w a r d s bridging the vertiable
chasm that has d e v e l o p e d .
All our love a n d lairiness,
IC M e n ' s 1st hockey team,
mainly Steve Morrell.
BITCH ALERT
Dear Editor
The Great British Bulldog is
alive in the guise of the Assistant
A c c o m m o d a t i o n Officer.
I had heard rumours of the
inferior treatment other students
had received at the hands of this
rude and boorish individual.
1 had not believed any of it,
until I was on the recieving end of
this w o m a n ' s aggressive, hostile
and overbearing manner.
M y mistake was to ask for
assistance in finding a c c o m m o d a -
tion in the private sector. English is
not my first language, like so many
other students at l . C . I had gone to
this office for advice, but was treat-
ed in a d i m i n u a t i v e w a y .
Subsequently my c o m m a n d of the
English Language was questioned
and also whether I had the ability
to be studing in this institution.
This incident h a p p e n e d a
month ago, and to my knowledge
the situation is still g o i n g o n .
Anyone w h o has had the misfor-
tune to c o m e up against these cir-
cumstances please c o m m e n t !
Since the senior management
has had little to say on the subject.
It is time the Great British Bulldog
was silenced.

OILY INTERESTS
Dear Felix
1 a m writing as a member of the
ICU Environmental Society. A lot of
people may have noticed that w e
have been collecting signatures for
a petition to Sir Ronald Oxburgh,
Rector of the college, asking him to
clarify his position on the close links
between IC and the O i l industry.
Imperial's funding is increasing-
ly c o m i n g from O i l companies with
a reputation for appalling environ-
mental distruction, denial of Global
W a r m i n g and links with assassina-
tions. W e w o u l d prefer to be fund-
ed through companies associated
with alternative energy forms and
ethical investments and through
state money.
Oil companies are investing a
small proportion of their budget
into renewable sources of energy
but they are making no move to
reduce overall oil c o n s u m p t i o n . O n
the contrary, they are planning
continued expansion of fossil fuel
c o n s u m p t i o n in the 21st century
(eg. By investing huge amounts
into exploration of new fields such
as the N o r t h Atlantic frontier),
whilst l o b b i n g persistently to
u n d e r m i n e international agree-
ments to limit greenhouse emis-
sions.
The Text of the petition is as
follows:
To Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of
Imperial College:
We the undersigned are c o n -
cerned by the college's close finan-
cial links with the oil industry and
hence our association with the
environmental damage, exploita-
tion of third world resources, sup-
pression of human rights and links
with the arms trade which arise
from that industry's activities. W e
do not wish our education and the
direction of our research to be

directed to such destructive ends.
As a non-executive director of
Shell Transport and Trading and the
Rector of Imperial College, w e call
on y o u to clarify this conflict of
interests.

WHAT D O DEP
REPS DO? G O O D
QUESTION...
Dear Jeremy,
What is a D e p Rep? This is a
question which a lot of people
have been asking m e recently,
whilst s t u m b l i n g t h r o u g h the
Presidential Suite, and so I'd like to
set the record straight once and for
all.
To cut out the nonsense, your
Dep Rep is your M P . Any problems
you have whilst y o u are at IC,
whether y o u are an undergraduate,
postgraduate, first year, final year,
or EVEN A M E D I C , your D e p Rep's
job is to... well, REPRESENT y o u .
So w h e n you've got a problem
with a lecturer, y o u should g o and
see your D e p Rep, w h o can sort
the problem out at staff-student
meetings. A n d w h e n y o u think the
prices in the d a Vinci's are far too
extortionate, then - tell your D e p
Rep, w h o has a full vote on ICU
Council, and can therefore... REP-
RESENT y o u .
Are w e getting the general
idea? N o w y o u may be asking w h o
your d e p rep is. Believe me, I often
ask the same question. Contact
your C C U (Constituent College
Union) President, and find out, and
then hassle them into doing their
job properly. M o s t D e p Reps are
very g o o d at their jobs, but there
are some w h o leave a lot to be
desired. Take the power back, find
out if you're being represented
properly and if not - change t h e m .
Best wishes (oh, and a belated
happy new year, folks),
Andy Heeps
ICU President
