TIME TO ABOLISH
THE CCUs
The problems of the City a n d
Guilds Union this year serve as a
pointed reminder; it's time to face
up to reality and admit what our
C C U s have become - outdated
self-serving remanents or their for-
mer selves that eat up resources
and d o hardly anyone any g o o d . It
would be ludicrous to have five stu-
dent unions at Imperial College,
but the student union identity is
still endemic in the C C U s . While
they are still called unions, the atti-
tude that they should be providing
social facilities will prevail even
though the ability to d o so it far
beyond their resources and c o m -
petence. IC School of Medicine
Union is the only C C U in living
memory that has run a 'proper'
students' union, and many of their
facilities are duplicated or bettered
by ICU.
Unfortunately, the inability of
the C C U s to d o the job they think
they should be doing interferes
with their attempts to d o the job
they should be doing; namely, aca-
demic support and advice for stu-
dents. Such support is woefully
lacking at IC (see m y rant in Felix
1 103) and though it would be great
if college overhauled the system,
it's really down to the students of
ICU to take the initiative.
Let's look at a specific exam-
ple. You enroll o n a new course, a
difficult one, only to find that you
lecturer is inaudible / incompetent /
wrong / failing to turn u p at all.
What can you do? At present, not
much. If you are fortunate enough
to have a d e p rep, then y o u c a n
complain to them. If they are one
of the more conscientious ones,
they inform department via the
staff-student committees, but the
department does nothing. The end
of the course rolls along (assuming
you're still doing it), and you fill in
the end of term questionnaire. " O h
dear", say the department, " D r
Death got a bad response this year.
Never mind, let's give him to the
first-years next time." A n d that's if
you're lucky. But d o n ' t worry,
there's always the C C U bar night to
drown your problems, maybe.
Close 'em d o w n . Get rid of the
archaic names and crests, burn the
regalia. W e don't need half-arsed
unions, w e need a properly run
academic support service for stu-
dents, people w h o are approach-
able and efficient with real powers
to make changes in the depart-
ments. Do it now.
AT H O M E BY THE
RIVER?
The poor state of IC's halls of resi-
dence is well known - I've heard an
estimate of £ 3 million just to keep
Southside Hall running safely.
The rich state of the IC boat
club is also well known - They've
just received £ 7 0 3 , 5 0 0 from the
National Lottery. (Felix 1 105)
Perhaps less well known are
two futher facts; that the new boat
house will incorporate nine study-
bedrooms (for use of the boat club
team members only), and that lot-
tery grants cannot be used to fund
a c c o m m o d a t i o n .
So w h o ' s paying for the bed-
rooms? It wouldn't be coming out
of the reisdences budget would it?
1 think we should be told.
