6th February 1998 JOHN HEGLEY: GOD?
b e c a u s e it d i m i n i s h e s t h e r a i n f o r e s t s "
school?
HEGLEY: Not really, 1 was ignored,
which is probably worse.
TROUT: H o w has the tour been
going?
HEGLEY: Very nice, we had a real-
ly, really nice time...
[How many times were y o u told
at school not to use the words
very, nice, really, and especially
really, really nice? -Ed]
...but thank G o d it's over.
TROUT: Are you likely to d o any
more radio work in the future?
HEGLEY: Yes, yes 1 a m , it's likely,
if all goes according to plan, I'll
do another little series of fifteen
minute pieces for radio four,
maybe a two hour special for GLR
for Easter.
TROUT: Are you going to get a
proper job?
HEGLEY: I don't k n o w . . . I've
always liked the thought of having
the best of both worlds, and so I
quite like t h e i d e a of having a
proper job as well as this one.
One piece of self indulgence; I
mentioned a thoroughly odious
w o m a n w h o had been sat beside
me at the show. I would have
complained at her insistent and
flesh-crawling commentary
throughout the show, but not hav-
ing paid for the tickets I thought it
a bit rude. John remembered her:
'You know I think I heard her
when Nigel came on: "I Love You
Nigel" I think she said... Yeah,
Nigel is a nice guy, but d o you
know what, a couple of people
c a m e up to him in the bar after
the show and said: "Listen, my
friend and 1 were really worried
about y o u , did something happen
to you before the show, you
know, are you all right?" and they
looked really miserable...
Finally, I asked about his seeming
obsession with potatoes, manifest
in his poetry, songs, and even a
ten-minute slide show of his
favourite tuberous vegetables
before the interval... He paused
for a full ten seconds, motionless,
before whispering with an entirely
deadpan expression: "They're
deep".
A
s an afterthought, John
Hegley turns and runs back
after us, telling us he'll d o
us a quick p o e m off the top of his
head:
Felix is often the name of a cat.
I'm not sure I know much about
why that is.
But anyway,
Let's not worry about it.
Yeah, John, erm, cheers...
