COLUMNS 6 February 1998
As you read this I shall
be on the piste in
Austria, but ever aware of my
duty to you, dear reader, this
was written last Friday, making it
a tad less topical than usual (no
sniggering at the back, please).
Like a bolt from the blue, the
Sabbatical elections are upon us
again. Those new to IC may think
this sets the pulse racing in
much the same way as a
European by-election in
Cleethorpes, and usually it does,
but last year was less than typi-
cal. It is easy to criticise the vot-
ers for the shambles of four elec-
tions, but when faced with some
of the clowns who stood in early
rounds, it is hardly surprising.
Thankfully, when the dust finally
settled, we ended up with a pret-
ty good set of sabbaticals, who
have done rather well this year.
Some of you have already thrown
your name into the hat and
doubtless more will join them,
so let Uncle Simon offer you the
benefit of his wisdom on this
subject. Some people stand for
election in order to put some-
thing back into the Union or wish
to change things for the better.
Others stand in the vain hope of
disguising the fact they have a
crap degree or can't decide what
to do next year or quite like the
idea of being a perpetual stu-
dent. If you fall
into any of the
second group
of categories,
please don't
waste our time.
You will lose,
and your char-
acter will be

sively assassi-
nated in Felix
by yours truly
and others. I'm
not really sup-
posed to talk about individual
candidates, but forgive me this
once. Both candidates for Felix
Editor, and others yet to come,
are truly magnificent people,
Titans among men, who will
surely appreciate the services of

they are both so good that I plan
to commit electoral fraud and
vote for both of them several
times. Best of British to you all.

As whining elements within
College are keen to remind us, a
lot of people at
Imperial smoke,
. often in the jCR.
Let's assume
that there are
15,000 staff and
f~t students at this
} place (assume,
("^ because no one
in Sherfield
P"™1 seems to know
' W" -mZZ. how many are
tSS -V on the payroll).
I~+ Probably 30-
40% smoke and,
for sake of argument, at a rate of
10 per day. That's a lot of baccy,
about £ 3 . 2 million. In other
words, if everyone stopped and
graciously donated this money to
the College, it would take exactly
12 months before the Music and
Arts Centre was paid for, remov-
ing the need for this embarrass-
ing art-by-numbers farrago we
are currently enduring; it would
take about 15 minutes if we also
collectively stopped drinking.
Though the current exhibition is
a slight improvement, in much
the same way as measles are
preferable to mumps, I must ask
if the shameless prostration of
Imperial at the feet of the
Lottery Arts Board. As I have said
before, there is much very good
contemporary British art out
there, which would nicely
embrace art and science, such as
some of the sculpture in Damien
Hirst's new restaurant. What we
get is conceptual art, devoid of
meaning so that criticism can be
ridiculed. God spare us this
rubbish.
