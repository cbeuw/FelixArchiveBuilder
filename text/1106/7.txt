THOUGHT FOR THE DAY

Beep! Beep! Feed me!
Beep! Beep! Love me!
Beep! Beep! Crunch.
I
remember a story a year or two
ago about a bloke w h o claimed
to have drawn up patents for a
"personal stereo system", l o n g
before a certain company got in on
the act. The last I heard of the tale
is that he was suing the aforemen-
tioned multinational for "shitloads
of cash". Whether or not the pro-
tagonist was successful in his bid I
d o not know, but given the old
adage that people are innocent as
long as they have a better lawyer
than the opposition, he is probably
still in jail paying court costs. Some
of you might feel rather sorry for
this once hopeful wretch, but I pour
scorn on such sympathy; nobody
wanted the d a m n things anyway.
There was once a time when
the hustle and bustle of the great
c o m m u n a l tube trains was a form
of music; the percussive "rat-a-tat-
tat" of the wheels combined with
the orchestral mumble of distin-
guished gentlemen and the hoi pol-
loi alike. It certainly differs from the
forms of music that other people
force us to listen to. "T - tt - tt - ttt
- t - tt - tt - tttt," usually c o m e s
from the warped music collection
of some piece of degenerate scum
who wears a vast pair of trousers
probably fashioned from two stolen
airstrip windsocks and a jacket
made using polychromic cast-offs
from a G o o d y e a r factory, w h o
assures us that we all want to sam-
ple his aural delights. The alterna-
tive is not much better; "Chh chh
chh chh chh chh chh chh," plods
the metallic dirge, and the din
seems to be competing for atten-
tion with the mind-wilting smell
emanating from the bizarrely-shorn
individual in question.
Yes, personal electronic c o m -
panions are here to stay, and I feel
that many miniaturisation experts
at this College are entirely respon-
sible. The latest installment of
pointless silicon, as everybody is
aware, is electronic pets. O n e
might think that the back-breaking
responsibility of p a r e n t h o o d is
something to be anticipated with
trepidation, so I d o not see the
advantage in being woken up at 4
a.m. by a maladjusted M i c r o Pet.
People walk around with the ugly,
cheap-looking ellipsoid hunks of
PVC~ dangling from their belts,
cranky devices d e m a n d i n g con-
stant and immediate attention. It
seems ironic that it is normally con-
sidered an advantage to construct
equipment that does not require
regular servicing. A n d will we soon
see the problem of unwanted ani-
mals, stray C P U s abandoned by
their owners, having to be collected
by the RSPCA and eventually put to
sleep by lethal battery removal?
What is the world c o m i n g to?

So, Tony Blair is off to
Washington. It is one of the side-
line jobs of most heads of state to
pop over to the meet the Leader of
the Free World for tea and sand-
wiches. For the smaller countries,
this usually means some g o o d pub-
licity, with 'our man' hob-nobbing
with the US President. For Britain,
the situation is slightly different.
American patriotism is defined by
their declaration of independence
from Britain, and along with the
Irish-American question, there has
always been a slight anti-British
undercurrent within the American
population. Relations also depend
on the ideology of the respective
leaders being similar: with Thatcher-
Reagan/Bush there was a rapport
between the leaders, and conse-
quently the Governments. W h e n
Clinton took over from Bush in
1992, rumours surfaced that the
Conservative Party had assisted
Republicans in the election c a m -
paign. As well as being a bad move
in supporting a losing side (some-
thing which -Had additionally been
clear beforehand ) political partisan-
ship in matters such these were
more than stupid. They were suici-
dal. John Major and Bill Clinton did
not get on at all well, with Clinton
rebuffing Major within one week of
entering the White House.
Clinton made little effort to hide
his admiration of Tony Blair, pulling
out all the stops when Blair visited
Washington a year before the
General Election. They have hold a
broadly similar position in the politi-
cal spectrum, and are known to be
g o o d friends as well as g o o d col-
leagues. Both leaders are extremely
useful to each other, with Blair's 'star'
status, along with Britain's recent
'Cool Britannia1
image overseas, pro-
viding some useful political capital
for the President. It seems Blair has
plenty to gain from being associated
with the United States.
Unfortunately for us, relations are
usually unequal. W e Britain is
undoubtedly the junior partner in the
special relationship, something
first one to prepare retaliatory EU
measures against the U.S. Helms-
Burton Act, punishing foreign c o m -
panies for investing in Cuba, Iran or
Libya. This was done with the full
support of the British Government.
Britain has also called for the U.S. to
pay what it owes to the United
Nations, remarking that they
"shouldn't have representation with-
out taxation", which raised a few
hackles.
O n the situation in the Gulf, the
U.S. and Britain are completely in
agreement. M a n y Gulf observers are

Eye
which was first made obvious in the
Suez Crisis in the 50s, the first time
the U.S. effectively told Britain to
hand back the colony and canal.
This and previous British
Governments have seen the U.S. as
a teacher in some senses, adopting
and learning from measures taken
across the pond. This may not have
been so obvious in Europe, when
even now, the Government seems
more eager to lecture than to listen.
However, Britain has not been
entirely sycophantic to the States in
foreign policy. Sir Leon Brittan, a
British EU Commissioner, was the
seriously concerned at the military
escalation in the Gulf - the other
three Permanent Members of the
U N Security Council, France, Russia
and China, oppose military action.
Nearly every Gulf state opposes mil-
itary action, with Israel being an
obvious exception, and Kuwait
putting up the least resistance.
When one considers it in a more his-
torical perspective, Britain has been
relatively pro-Arab, the U.S. pro-
Israel this century. Britain had
colonised much of the Gulf, and in
many cases relations are close (the
King of Jordan went to R M A
Sandhurst, the Army's Officer
A c a d e m y ) . Anglo-Israeli relations
had never been good, starting with
the St David's Hotel bombing after
war, with claims that the present
Israeli Government is descended
from a terrorist group, M o s t observ-
er comment that Israel as a state
would never have got off the ground
if were not for the support of the
U.S. Government.
So on an area of potential divide
between the U.S. and Britain, Britain
stands side by side, the only country
publicly to d o so. It seems that our
Government has got to like a new
tactic of standing by other
Governments in trouble (note British
support of French nuclear testing),
no doubt to extract a few favours
later. Perhaps Blair is playing the
long game in Anglo-American rela-
tions, one that the press don't nec-
essarily seem to be picking up.
The one thing that Tony Blair
must be laughing about will be the
Tories' reaction to these events.
They are still discussing the cost of
ministers' offices' refurbishment, try-
ing to extend the 'sleaze' image for
as long as possible. If the public
wish to hear this message, they
probably don't want to hear it from
the Tories. As Blair discusses the
state of world politics today, Hague
discusses office furniture. Let us
hope they soon provide some cred-
ible opposition, before Labour get
too big for its boots. The ramifica-
tions for that would not make pleas-
ant reading.
