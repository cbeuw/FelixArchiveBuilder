he f r e e s t y l e r s are a
n a m e that my not be
familiar at the m o m e n t ,
but all that is about to change
with their new single B-Boy
Stance s t o r m i n g into the
national charts last week at
number 23. A killer track that
has been caned in the right
clubs for a while now, and
played extensively on Radio
and Kiss F M .
The freestylers are a full on
group; eight people combine to
create their fresh sound, not to
mention their break-dancers (yes
people still break dance and few
better than the thirty strong Freska
Break-dance crew).
N o w back to the group. Aston
Harvey (ex-Blapps Posse) and M a t t
Cantor (major L o n d o n break DJ)
oversee things with their knowl-
edge and production skills. The
other members of the group are j -
Rock (Scratch Dj champion) cutting
things up, Jo on bass guitar, Chris
on lead guitar and the hard beats of
drummer Clive. With vocals by the
one 'n' only Tenor Fly (Major UK
reggae artist) and M C Navigator (a
top drum bass M C , Radio 1, one
in the jungle M C ) this is quite an
impressive line up.

This comes as a C D - R o m (char-
acters shown feature in the visual
experience) with visuals that are
-one with the music and clearly dis-
play the message that is being put
across if you've got a computer
that can run it. If not, the music
itself can stand alone. This is not a
mere backing track to the visual
display but cutting edge beats,
breaks & samples.
Aston Plays
The freestylers have been mak-
ing a name for themselves on the
fast e m e r g i n g Big-Beat scene
(break beat with big bass-lines),
which L o n d o n once again seems to
be leading the way in. I have been
listening to their previous works
over the last few weeks and believe
me these are no one-hit wonders
and look likely to blow up in '98.
Aston kindly took time out from
recording their follow up single to
have a chat with me about past,
present &. the future of himself and
the freestylers. H e describes their
music as an amalgamation of H i p -
H o p , Electro &. the whole Break-
Beat culture. O l d Skool flavour with
a new identity via a use of different
production techniques.
He started out DJing at the age
of 16, and around this time was
friends with rappers Brotherhood.
They had wanted to make a track
together for a while, so they got
there ideas together and headed to
the studio to put their ideas d o w n .
H e admits that his early
attempts were nothing special but
says that, with time, as he learned
how to use the equipment and the
ideas came in thick and fast, the
quality of the music he m a d e
improved. H e said that he still
learns new tricks and ways of doing
things all the time so it's a continu-
ous process.
Aston's tip for wana-be produc-
ers is to get all your ideas together
well before y o u get anywhere near
the studio. For example, drum
rolls, b r e a k - d o w n s , bass-lines,
Freestyle
melodies should all be worked out
beforehand. If possible take some-
one w h o knows how to use a stu-
dio with you to show y o u how to
work the equipment yourself.
Around '91 Aston formed part
of The Blapps Posse, making simi-
lar music as Shut 'n' Dance but they
didn't get hyped as m u c h . Later on,
in a solo project he created one of
the biggest tunes, a true classic of
those large scale rave days of 91-
93, Don't Hold Back. That could be
heading for a re-release and I'm
sure it'll be a big hit again. He has
also worked with the first lady of
jungle, DJ Rap, before meeting up
with Matt to form The Freestylers.
So they have plenty of experience
to call on.
W h e n asked why they seem to
be have such wide spread success
with the Freestylers, he said that
there is a c o n c e p t behind the
group, a direction and identity to
the music. Well there's definitely
something.
Matt and Aston, also play-out,
DJing regularly in such places as
M i a m i , Italy &. M u n i c h as well as
regular U K dates. S o m e of the
forthcoming dates are: Saturday 7
Feb. Project B, M i l t o n Keynes,
Friday 13 Feb. Middlesborough
Arena, and finally making a London
appearance at The Clinic, on
Saturday 28 Feb. Before they shoot
off to M i a m i .
Then back to London for 13
M a r c h at Club Innocence, London
Bridge and Fri 20 M a r c h at Hanover
Grand. Finally returning to London
to rip up the Jazz Cafe, London on
26 April. Check club listings for info
nearer the dates. Also mixing the
Essential M i x on Radio O n e ,
Sunday 8 Feb. O n e not to be
missed.
There are plans for a European
tour over the summer to coincide
with the a l b u m release, which
should be around 8 M a y . A n d plen-
ty of festival appearances lined up
including Phoenix, Glastonbury and
Tribal Gathering. JT\c\

shows the ability of these two pro-
ducers to make the most amazing
assortment of beats 'n' breaks fit
together perfectly. They have cut
'n' spliced together beat upon beat.
The way the remixes change pace
and style, but seem to keep the
s a m e direction, is impressive.
Almost every track has it's own
individual style, but at the same
time is part of the whole.
So all in all a most impressive
collection of sounds that works
very well on it's o w n , and I can't
wait to see the live show, which is
sure to blow you away.
O n e day all music will be pro-
duced this way. O n e Step Ahead.

This also music with a serious
message, as you may be able to
guess from the title, that message
to "highlight the abuse
of the worlds bios-
phere and indige
nous tribes"
Timber is ai.
attempt by Coldcut h.jJ'A
Hex to d o something Jj
about it.
Track 1 starts out
with a wicked mix of ||
s a m p l e s and beats that
builds up nicely with a tribal chant
type vocal over samples of what
sounds like engines or machinery
breaking it up. I think this could be
part of the message, which is clear
when seen with the C D - R O M .
Track 2 has a strong electro
beat thing going on that works par-
ticular well. Track 3 picks up the
pace, a full on break beat number
that is almost D&J5, again carry-
ing the same
tribal vocal as
the first track.
i E x c e l l e n t
m i s h - m a s h of
beats. Various
i remixes feature
I hear but they
f are used in a
more chilled envi-
ronment and works
Just as well. The pace is raised
again with a crazy fast t e m p o break
beat track with a sax thrown in for
g o o d measure. Track 7 once again
