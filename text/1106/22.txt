COLONY WARS
Pysgnosis • • • •
'Fight for a cause, fight for what y o u
believe in but don't forget the con-
sequences of war', this would sum
up the feeling of Colony Wars and
the atmosphere it creates. You are
a pilot on the side of the League of
Free Worlds waging a guerrilla war
against the Imperialist Navy. At
your disposal are various different
types of fighter craft for a multitude
of different missions. There are
OVERBOARD!

Avast there me harties! Shiver me
timbers, keel haul the mainsail!
Erm... no, I've run out of Pirate say-
ings. Anyway, I haven't gone m a d -
I've been playing O v e r b o a r d , a
highly enjoyable and silly adventure
into the realm of arcade piracy.
The player controls a dinky little
several different endings to Colony
Wars, several different ways of
ending the tyranny of the Czar and
his Imperialist Navy. Each ending
depends on the outcome of each
of your missions, fail all your mis-
sions and the League is d o o m e d ,
but in each case the story will
always have a beginning and an
end.
After a couple of missions the
game cuts away to the all-too-
familiar c o m p u t e r generated
movie, w h i c h has the feel of
Babylon 5 and Star Wars (James
Earl Jones does his usual evangelis-
tic bellowing for the narration in
each cut-scene).
The gameplay is exhilarating,
those of y o u w h o have played X-
wing or Tie Fighter will enjoy the
dog-fights and will be relieved that
there aren't 101 different controls
to fly your fighter craft. Colony
Wars has m o v e d away from those
usual games set in space where the
black background colour usually
dominates. Here huge frigates and
other space war horses often fill
pirate ship, complete with cannons
and sails, and must attempt to tra-
verse the sixteen levels of choppy
seas.
Each level is enormous, and can
easily take half an hour to c o m -
plete. The basic idea is to collect all
of the parts of the map of level,
found in green floating bottles.
Along the way are treasure chests
and weapons to be gained. Some
of the additional weapons are dis-
tinctly un-piratey, especially the
flamethrower a n d ground-to-air
missiles.
Standing in the budding pirates'
way are rival ships, sea monsters,
gun emplacement, flame-throwing
towers and even massive spinning
sawblades (somewhat reminiscent
of M a r i o or Sonic). However, the
player rarely feels totally lost or
hard done by, and the game cer-
tainly kept me c o m i n g back for
What is it?
Its the Microsoft SideWinder
Force Feedback Pro.
What does it do?
It's a PC joystick that has more
buttons than any sane person
would require.
What's so special about it?
This little beaty c o m e s with its
own processor and motors to
provide 'force feedback'. If
you've ever played Sega Rally in
the arcade, you will be used to
the screen, while the o d d asteroid
flies by - space is not a black void
in this game. There are several dif-
ferent types of craft with different
abilities and weaponry, disabling a
craft with an E M P w e a p o n will
make it a sitting duck and easier to
shoot d o w n while anti-shield
weapons can wear d o w n your ene-
mies' defenses faster than your
normal lasers.
However the lasting appeal of
Colony Wars is limited,- as it is pos-
sible to reach one ending within a
single sitting, while repeated play-
ing is only required to discover the
different endings to the saga. This
is a well polished game with all the
trimmings, animated s e q u e n c e s
narrated by Darth Vader himself,
analogue joypad compatibility and
excellent head-to-head d o g fights.
Another game to get your arthritic
fingers on.

The whole game has a wonder-
fully engaging atmosphere, from
the animation of the boats and sea
creatures to the jaunty nautical
theme tune that you'll be h u m m i n g
for days afterwards.
The g a m e is eventually let
d o w n by its lack of variety in level
design, and the difficulty in defeat-
ing s o m e of the end-of-level
bosses. A battle m o d e is included,
which allows up to five captains to
compete, but this requires a very
large TV (or keen eyesight) as each
ship is very small.
Overboard! is certainly a wel-
c o m e addition to any puzzle-loving
gamer's collection, but those
requiring more a more cerebral
challenge should give it a wide
berth (groan).

the feeling of the wheel fighting
you on corners. This is the feel-
ing that M S want to bring to
home PC owners.
Is it any good?
Well, games need to be written
to support it, but it could bring
a w h o l e new d i m e n s i o n to
games.
What's the catch?
The cost, - around £ 1 30, which
is excessive even for a PC joy-
stick. Of course, y o u could
always trade in your Saturn...

ON THE HORIZON
Saturn 2 rumours continue to
grow - n o w c o d e n m a e d 'Katana',
it is likely that the superconsole
from Sega will use NEC's PowerVR
graphics chipset and the 128-bit
Hitachi S H - 4 processor.
In a promising twist, Katana may
support the Direct3D API for easy
co-development with PC games.
Future Publishing's Edge Magazine
has w o n the INDIN 'Best
M a g a z i n e ' award, again confirming
its status as the top interactive
entertainment magazine around.
All this without a cover-mounted
C D too...
Resident Evil 2 (PlayStation) has
been realeased in Japan, to excel-
lent reviews. The sequal Konami's
suprise hit 'survival horror' game
should be in the U K within a cou-
ple of months. I for one can't wait.
Gran Turisimo (PlayStation) is yet
another racing game and should
be around s o o n . Rave reviews
abound, and the game received an
unprecedented 10 out of 10 from
Edge magazine - only the second
game ever!
Yoshi's Story (N64) is the slightly
disappointing follow-up to Yoshi's
Island on the SNES. Despite not
living up to its promise, it will ;
undoubtedly be snapped up by
software-hungry N 6 4 owners upon
its UK release.
Bomberman Fight! should cheer
up beleagured Saturn owners. The
classic mulitplayer game returns in
an appropriately 3D form, appar-
ently without spoiling its unique
gameplay.
