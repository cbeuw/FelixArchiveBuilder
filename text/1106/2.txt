NUS to Strike
ALOK JHA
The NUS announced last week
that its plans for a shutdown of
Further and Higher Education
centres across the country has
been overwhelmingly supported
by a national ballot.
O n 4 M a r c h , over 130 universi-
ties and colleges will close d o w n .
Student unions will be the centre of
the campaign on the day, with over
two million students taking part.
Support will also c o m e from other
teaching and c a m p u s trade unions.
The day of protest follows what the
NUS call a "carefully planned battle
of attack against the Government's
plans to introduce fees" which has,
so far, included a day of protest
last November, a W e e k of Action in
December, and a series of lobbies
on parliament.
The N U S claim that students
and their parents contribute
enough to Higher Education, and
that business and industry should
now be making a more 'formal'
contribution. It is h o p e d that the
actions of the N U S will force a re-
thinking of the Teaching and Higher
Education Bill, which proposes the
idea of tuition fees and is currently
being passed through the House of
Lords.
Douglas Trainer, N U S presi-
dent, said that, "this is a fight we
can win and w e will defeat the
Government. The national shut-
d o w n will show our anger. Fees
are killing a c c e s s to Higher
Education, they will destroy our
universities and colleges just as
they destroy would-be students'
dreams of higher education."
Government figures released
last December revealed a drop of
2 0 , 0 0 0 in the number of applica-
tions to universities, showing the
concern that many school leavers
are feeling at the idea of having to
pay for their higher education.
M a n y universities are considering
various measures that will allow
students to pay less, such as begin-
ning the courses in spring or reduc-
ing the total course length.
Warning: Speakers
Unsound
TONY OFOR1
On Thursday of last week a resi-
dent of Bernard Sunley Hall was
mugged. While on his way to col-
lege, the student was s t o p p e d on
Queen's Gate by two m e n w h o
pulled up in a white van. The driver
asked the student whether he
wanted to buy s o m e cheap hi-fi
speakers. The student declined,
but the man persisted, so the stu-
dent explained that he had to go
because he was late for college.
The man offered him a lift and the
student agreed, and got into the
back of the van. O n c e inside the
driver's accomplice, w h o had been
quiet until now, told the student to
hand over his money. Due to the
man's threatening behaviour the
student obliged, but the ordeal did
not end there. After discovering
which bank the student patronised,
the driver took him to a branch and
forced him to withdraw £ 4 0 from a
cash dispensing machine. The stu-
dent was then freed.
This was one success in a long
line of attempts to con IC students
by a group claiming to be delivery
men. O n e hall warden described it
as "a premeditated and organised
scam". Other students have also
been accosted, and some have
even purchased the speakers, only
later to find that they are extremely
poor quality.
The scale of this fraudulent
operation is not known for certain,
but it would seem that more than
one partnership is operating in the
South Kensington area. The deliv-
ery m e n target students and tend
to use various excuses to explain
how they got hold of the merchan-
dise. The audio name on the side
of the vehicle, along with the deliv-
ery registration form they often
brandish, serve to increase the
apparent authenticity of their con.
College security are aware of the
situation and the police have been
informed.
FEES REPRIEVE
The new university tuition fees
introduced by the government
last year have once again been
watered d o w n . In an attempt to
ease the current higher education
funding crisis, all new students are
being asked to contribute £ 1000 a
year towards their course costs.
However, in the s u m m e r , the
Department of Education agreed
to make the charge means-test-
ed, e x e m p t i n g students f r o m
poorer families from the charge.
N o w , students are being offered
an amnesty period, and will not
have to pay until January 1999.
Diana Warwick, Chief Executive of
the Committee of Chancellors and
Vice Chancellors (CVCP) w h o
made the decision explained that
"Students will be invoiced w h e n
they arrive at university, and w e
expect most to pay immediately.
But those students w h o experi-
ence real difficulty in meeting the
full amount straight away will now
have more time to pay.
BARTS SAVED
St Bartholemew's hospital was
granted a reprieve from the threat
of closure o n Tuesday, when the
government accepted the r e c o m -
mendations of an independent
review of L o n d o n ' s hospitals.
Bart's will continue as a specialist
centre for cancer and heart condi-
tions, but will loose its A E role,
as will Guy's. Speaking to the
C o m m o n s , Frank D o b s o n , the
Health Sectretary, said "We will
not countenance the closure of
that great hospital w h i c h has
served the people of L o n d o n for
875 years."
The closure of Bart's was first
p r o p o s e d in 1992 by the
Tomlinson report, and the hospi-
tal was due to close by 2001, with
services transferred to the Royal
London.
M e a n w h i l e , the merger of
H a m m e r s m i t h (home of the
R P M S ) a n d Charring Cross
Hospitals is to be accelerated, and
is to include the transfer of Queen
Charlotte's to the Hammersmith
site. Indeed, the report marks
Hammersmith out to be devel-
o p e d into an international centre
of excellence, w h i c h therefore
stands to benefit heavily from the
extra £ 1 4 0 million promised for
the N H S in the capital.
PI CONSUMES
The student n e w s p a p e r at
University College London, Pi, has
merged with its smaller brother
The Week. Pi had been losing rev-
enue in recent years and was
forced to rely heavily on U C L
Union for support. In order to
save funds, it has merged with the
union's 'what's o n ' newspaper.
The name has been retained, and
the paper is n o w being published
weekly.
