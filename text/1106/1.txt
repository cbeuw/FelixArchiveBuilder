At a surprisingly vocal
m e e t i n g of the City &.
Guilds Officers and
M e m b e r s Council ( O M C )
last M o n d a y , a year of per-
c e i v e d inactivity a n d
i n c o m p e t e n c e f r o m the
C&.G Union Executive final-
ly came to a head with the
presentation of a motion
of no-confidence in Vivake
Bhalla, the C8JGU
President. However, as M r
Bhalla was absent from the
meeting, and thus unable
to defend himself, C & G U
rules forbade the proposal
being put to a vote, and
instead the O M C passed a
m o t i o n to c o n v e n e an
Emergency M e e t i n g o n
Tuesday 10 February,
where the motion of no-
confidence w o u l d be discussed,
with or without M r Bhalla.

threatening to push for a motion of
no-confidence in the entire Guilds
Executive. Instead ICU Council,
w h o met on Tuesday night, passed
a m o t i o n c o m m e n d i n g the
actions of the O M C , but
asking the C & C U
Executive to produce reg-
ular reports so that ICU
Executive can m o n i t o r
their progress. Speaking to
Felix A n d y H e e p s , ICU
President, said that "it
w o u l d be unrealistic to
expect great changes this
year... but by recognising
that they have a problem
O M C have made the first
step to improving C & G U " .
H o w e v e r , M r H e e p s
pointed out that it would
be w r o n g to put all of the
blame for the problems in
C & C this year on M r
Bhalla; "Vivake has been
made into some kind of
s c a p e g o a t , but all he's
d o n e w r o n g is not know-
ing w h e n to give in". This
point was emphasised by Hannah

Boat Club Bus Found in Thames
ANDY OFORI
The IC Boat Club's minibus has
recently been placed into early
retirement, after being
found bobbing in the
Thames. Vandals broke
into the vehicle in the early
hours of a winter's morn-
ing, released the hand
brake, and pushed the bus
into the River Thames.
The following day, dur-
ing an early morning train-
ing session, a team of
rowers were astounded to
discover their minibus had
joined them in the water.
The drenched bus had to
be p u s h e d back the
500yds it had drifted downstream,
and was placed outside the boat
club, where it has taken up perma-
nent residence. Jules Davenport,
the boat club captain, w h o was
amongst those training at the time,
could only describe the experience
as "very bizarre".

The boat club's minibus is not
the only vehicle to fall foul of the
hooligans, a number of other cars
in the area have suffered a similar
fate. The incidents are sympto-
matic of a six month spate of van-
dalism in the Putney area; clothing,
personal belongings and outboard
engines have all been
stolen from several nearby
boat clubs. The crime
wave has even extended
to the theft of a 30ft trail-
er from one club.
The police have con-
d u c t e d an investigation
into the incident. N e w
security measures have
been installed, and patrols
in the area have been
s t e p p e d up. The boat
club's coach, Bill M a s o n ,
described the act as a
"sick joke" but was heart-
ened by the fact that high levels of
security have limited attacks on the
boathouse to this solitary event.
