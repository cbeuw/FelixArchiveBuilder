FOIL
Spread It All Around
T
he wind howls. A n engine
groans and gains power.
Then a gigantic mechanical
machine starts up and pelts
straight into a non-stop race to
crush everything in its way.
W o w . Great o p e n i n g track.
High hopes all round, then, that the
discovery of the year has been
made. That Foil are THE band of
'98. M a y b e Felix will go d o w n in
history as 'The Paper that Brought
Foil to the World.' M a y b e .
O n to track 2. M a y b e not. For
this song, they decided to put
vocals over the track giving the
voice of a more-than-a-few-years-
past-it punker. S o m e o n e w h o
thinks he is Scotland's answer to
Kurt Cobain. A n d the music has
changed as well. Straight punk
meets heavy metal. Still g o o d but
just totally different to what it
could, or should, have been.
Foil's lyrics concentrate on the
darker side of life. Hailing from
W e s t Lothian maybe y o u can't
blame them but there are a few
gems tucked away in here. Buried
in the middle of the album, sur-
rounded by ferocious assaults o n
silly things like soup, is a very dif-
ferent song. Slow and calm and
reminiscent of Radiohead and
Velvet Underground, the track A
Place To Hide contains a beautiful
melody yet still retains the raw
naivety of the rest of this album. If
only more tracks were like this. In
fact, one thing you can say about
this album is that it is diverse. It's
not all mindless pap. There's fast
pap, slow pap, probably-more-dis-
torted-than-it-needs-to-be p a p
and utterly-original-and-a-breath-
of-fresh-air pap. Perhaps slightly
over-rated by their label ('Foil reaf-
firm your faith in the healing power
of electric guitars') they were
nonetheless signed o n the strength
of their d e m o tape and debut gig
alone.
Also w e l c o m e is a minor hit
from a year or two ago called
Reviver Gene - you'll remember it
when y o u hear the chorus. All in all,
if heavy metal/grungeAVest-Coast
punk is your thing then give Foil a
go. Just bear in mind that they use
the same producer as Elastica

DELICATESSEN
There's No Confusing Some People
O
h dear - and it had such
potential as well. W h a t
with the n a m e
Delicatessen being somewhat of a
buzz w o r d within the music scene
of late, I really was expecting a bet-
ter effort than this. Intriguing C D
cover design and track titles just
added to this expectation, increas-
ing the height from w h i c h it
inevitably fell.
Let's begin with track one,
more of an intro than a song really
and it truly does set the scene for a
poor s h o w . A vocalist cross
between Nick Cave a n d Lurch
Addams attempts to paint a dark,
No Stars
s o m b r e and s o m e w h a t surreal
tone, what a pity that they seem to
have turned to an Estate Agent's
imagination to try - and ultimately
fail - to achieve this. Through con-
torted vocals, Geldof skits and
produces second rate indie rock.
There's No Confusing Some People
reaches the ludicrous Various Pets.
If y o u ' v e ever thought that
Phoebe's (from Friends) Smelly
Cats should make it to release, this
one's for y o u . There's more talent
in a dead mouse.
Despite attempts not to be
p i g e o n h o l e d within a specific
genre, Delicatessen c o m e across as
a drunk A s h impersonating Suede
doing a Blur - sounds appealing? 1
think not.
There is surprisingly an upside
to this album - it's only thirty min-
utes long, a n d w h e n y o u ' v e
resigned yourself to wasting an
hour of your life with it, this is bet-
ter than early parole.
There's No Confusing Some
People is half an hour of conflicting
sounds, dodgy lyrics, and repeated
attempts at being something that
Delicatessen are not. Their con-
scious decision not to fall into the
same bracket as many a rock band,
will surely see them fall into the
ever increasing canyon inhabited by
all those w h o were nothing better,
but thought they were. Leave this
one well alone, it'll serve better as a
shelf insulator at the local H M V .
