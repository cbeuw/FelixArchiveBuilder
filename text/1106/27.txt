O n Friday 30 January, Tarik &.
Hedley, members of the cycling
&. c r o s s - c o u n t r y running club
took part in the Serpentine 5km
race. This takes place every last
Friday of the m o n t h at 12:30.
Unfortunately our intrepid run-
ners w e r e m i s i n f o r m e d about
this ck so w h e n they turned up
dying for a p#ss with minutes
before the start they weren't
pleased.
in the leading group from the
start, they held third 8. fourth
places until the final mile.
Spurred o n by shouts from
Hedley, Tarik went for the lead-
ers, passed them & w o n . Hedley
held his fourth at the finish.
It w o u l d nice to see some
more IC runners next time so
c o m e cv have a go if y o u think
you're hard enough! Contact

John M c C a r t n e y and Laurent Gould
came a ctedible second in their
class for the Prince William of
W a l e s pairs c h a m p i o n s h i p s , a
national postal shooting c o m p e t i -
tion with over 600 competitors.
They also managed to both gain
promotion in the individuals event
and will now no longer be consid-
ered as the Vauxhall Conference
league players and will be in divi-
sion 3 next year should they have
the bottle to go for the big time.
Dan Booker also gains promotion
from Div3 to Div2 by winning a
Prince William of wales badge.
N o - o n e from IC strayed into the
lower halves of their divisions, so
well d o n e M i k e , Andrew, Nick,
Paul, Rupert, and Jacob as well as
the winners of cups and badges.
The next individual shoot will be in
march/april, being the equivalent of
the Autoglass Windshields Trophy
so watch out for results in "FELIX"
because they w o n ' t be on
Grandstand (might make Live TV
though).
