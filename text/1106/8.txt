THE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO GETTING A FIRST with COLIN DALE
Part Two: Tutorials
traumatic stress disorder).
This kind of tutor often has the ability to see
into your soul, a n d can tell, the moment y o u
walk through the door, that y o u haven't read
any lecture notes since the first week of term.
So excuses are out. But don't worry, the situa-
tion is not s o desperate that y o u have to rely
only o n hard work to get y o u through. With
these handy hints, it may still be possible to get
a g o o d reference from him without doing a sin-
gle problem sheet.
Be punctual, polite, but above all never be
honest. It may be true that you were prevented
from coming in last week due to a crippling
hangover and/or court summons, but a dental
appointment generally creates a better impres-
sion. Tutors d o not generally write negative
comments in your reference, it still pays to be
on good behaviour - y o u d o not want 'rarely
attends tutorials' listed as a positive attribute.
Being asked a difficult question in a tutorial
is a bit like running out of ideas when you're try-
ing to write a column for Felix. You have t o say
something, whether it actually means anything
or not. So you just burble o n and o n incoher-
ently, mindlessly spouting the most pointless
drivel just to fill the awkward space. You talk
and talk and talk and talk, but don't actually say
Tutorials represent a golden opportunity for an
interactive exchange of ideas between students
and those w h o are knowledgeable in their field.
(But remember you can sue them if they get too
interactive.). Your tutor also has a g o o d deal of
input into your reference. You'd better be nice
to them, because you don't want your career to
be jeopardised by some evil, vindictive o l d
lunatic (save that privilege for your interviewer).
Academic tutors at IC fall broadly into t w o
main categories. Firstly, there are those w h o
consider undergraduate tutoring t o be an irrele-
vant waste of time; then there are those w h o
consider undergraduate tutoring to be an irrele-
vant waste of time but still think it's damn g o o d
fun to make y o u sweat. If your tutor is in the
first category, you are sorted for the whole year:
you have met someone w h o obviously feels the
same way as you, a n d there will be a kind of
unspoken mutual agreement never to see each
other again. The second type, w h o can usually
be distinguished by a demonic glint in the eyes,
are more worrying, and will be dealt with below.
If it is your misfortune t o have to see
Dr.B.L.Zebub in room 6 6 6 every week for the
rest of the year, it would be a g o o d idea to learn
how to survive the ordeal. It may even be pos-
sible to gain something from it (other than post-
anything much at all. Like that.
To d o really well in tutorials, you must mas-
ter the art of floundering. Simply saying T don't
know' in response to a tough question may be
honest, but it doesn't get you anywhere. In fact
it is an incredibly foolish thing to d o as it leaves
the door wide open to further probing of your
weaknesses. Saying ' u m m . . . e r r . . .' for a few
minutes is a g o o d start, but will not really buy
you that much time. You need to work a few
random phrases into your routine, such as 'inte-
gral', 'four pi' or 'decaying exponential'. As you
become more proficient in these tactics, y o u
will also be able t o use terms which are actually
relevant to what you are doing. With practice,
you will soon have the ability to carry o n like this
for s o long that the tutor will eventually forget
what he asked you and pick on some other poor
unfortunate to relieve his b o r e d o m . Real
experts have been known to stave off further
inquisition for up to twenty minutes using this
method.
Another aspect of tutorials is the opportuni-
ty to ask questions which are relevant and aid
your appreciation of the course. But 'Can we go
home yet?' is not likely to get the best response.
I'll see y o u next week to discuss your lab
reports.
