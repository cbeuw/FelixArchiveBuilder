Once upon a time, there was a
monestry containing, surprise
surprise, a fair number of monks,
plus one abbot. Being a silent
order, they could not c o m m u n i -
cate in any way. The only infor-
mation that p a s s e d b e t w e e n
them at all was via a blackboard
placed in the dining r o o m , on
which only the Abbot may write.
O n e M o n d a y , the m o n k s
were all sitting d o w n for their
daily meal, when the abbot wrote
on the board this message:
"Some of our monks have
been p o i s o n e d . The p o i s o n e d
m o n k s have green faces. All
green-faced monks must leave
immediately."
The monks, being both intelli-
gent and compliant, would not
hesitate to fulfil the abbot's wish-
es. Although they had no mirrors
and thus no way of examining
their o w n faces, the relevant
monks duly left.
Given that the Abbot erases
the message after the last poi-
soned monk resigned, and that
s o m e m o n k s d i d so o n the
Sabbath, the question is:
How many green-faced
monks were there, and on what
days did they to leave?
