t's a hard life being a billionaire.
You are never sure if your
supermodel wife is only with
you for your money, or if supposed
friends socialise with y o u purely
because they want something. This
is Anthony Hopkins' situation in
The Edge, a superior o u t d o o r
adventure film in the m o u l d of
Deadly Pursuits and The River Wild.
Hopkins once again plays a
reserved aging Englishman, albeit
with a stunning wife in the form of
Elle MacPherson. The two take a
holiday in the beautiful remote
Alaskan wilderness. A c c o m p a n y i n g

may not be having an affair with
the wealthy man's wife. There is a
clear tension between the t w o
men, and this c o m e s to a peak
w h e n events conspire to place
them miles from civilization, relying
on one another to stay alive.
The plot may sound as corny as
the usual Hollywood thriller but this
film manages to retain suspense
throughout. This is partly due to
the qualities of Hopkin, w h o s e
character strives to help Baldwin at
every turn despite suspecting that
the younger man wants to kill him
and obtain his inheritance through
his wife. It is a treat to see this dis-
tinguished actor pitting his wits
against the dangers of the great
o u t d o o r s , w h i c h include a
particularly ferocious man-hunting
bear.
If you have already seen that
film then you could d o far worse
than try The Edge. It doesn't take
itself too seriously and, best of all,
there is not a sinking boat in sight.

his is a French arty film,
w h i c h mostly meets your
expectations. Clubbed to
Death is a love story set in the
slightly unusual surroundings of a
nightclub, where a girl accidentally
meets a bloke and becomes his
girlfriend. In addition to the
standard romantic script are the
m o d e r n elements. The leading
male is forced into bashing his o w n
brother in an illegal fight, gives up
crack and d u m p s his current
girlfriend. The club that the film
centres around is a converted
church at the end of bus line and
this c o m b i n e s with a barren,
broken landscape to create a
s o m b r e and distracted
atmosphere.
Unfortunately I found that I
really didn't care what happened to
the characters. I couldn't
empathise with them even though
they are s u p p o s e d l y part of a
similar youth culture to mine. A
distraction, possibly due to the
translation from French, is that
there are points in the film when
the conversations make no sense
whatsoever. This, of course, may
be part of the French mystical
atmosphere.
O n e of the better aspects of
the film was the soundtrack. A
t h u m p i n g selection of tunes,
including Chemical Brothers and
Massive Attack, help to give the
film a unique atmosphere. Even
Eric Clapton shows his musical
talents in one of the most
evocative scenes in the film. If you
do see this at the cinema thena
g o o d quality sound system is a
must.
For me it turned out to be a
dreary non-eventful incomprehen-
sible waste of film. It may be worth
watching only when it c o m e s on
Channel Four or B B C 2 late at night.
If y o u do, look out for that classic
pulling technique, wearing a
creaking leather jacket and flip-
flops. O LFB

Win tickets for Hard Rain courtesy of
ODEON KENSINGTON
The next big film to open in Britain is Hard Rain, an
action thriller starring Morgan Freeman, Christian
Slater and Randy Quaid.
The action is set in Huntingburg, a small town
which is evacuated when torrential rain brings rising
flood water. The local sheriff, Randy Quaid, and the
town's residents and are all too familiar with the loot-
ing and petty thefts that take place in an abandoned
town. However, even they would not suspect the size
of the planned heist of an armoured security van con-
taining 3 million dollars.
The driver of the van is Christian Slater and he
manages to escape from the budding thieves w h o are
led by M o r g a n Freeman. The film then follows
Freeman's frantic pursuit of Slater in a fast-moving
style that doesn't give y o u time to dwell o n
implausibilities.
As usual the O d e o n Kensington has donated the
prizes for our competition. There are five pairs of
tickets to see the film and these can be w o n by mailing
the answer to the following to felix@ic.ac.uk
Which controversial film about slavery released
this month also stars Morgan Freeman?
Last week's Titanic competition was the most
popular one yet. Those with a g o o d memory will
remember that we wanted to know which other James
Cameron film was set as sea. The answer we were
looking for was The Abyss, although as one person
correctly pointed out he also directed Piranha II: The
Spawning which took place in the Carribean. So
congratulations to Frederic M a q u e t w h o wins a prize
for being such a film buff.
