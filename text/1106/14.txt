Seba. Connected.
(LookingGood Rec.) 9th Feb.
If, it's on LookingGood Rec. You
know your in for a musical treat,
and this latest offering is no disap-
pointment. Connected is a deep
jazz roller, even beautiful, the way
your carried away on the strong
atmospherics, rolling bass-line &.
tight percussion. A n y o n e h o w
thinks D&J5 isn't real music just
samples strung together, should
check this, a master piece of beat
technology. Keeping LG one step
ahead of the rest.
DJ Ron. Quintessence.
(Some' ting Rec.) Out Now.
This a triple vinyl pack for only
£10, a true bargain. Six tracks in
all, featuring DJ Ron's Space jazz,
and DJ Krust full length rinse out
mix of it.
21st Century, un-surprisingly starts
off with 21st century fox title
music, with sounds so bad that I
can not understand what pos-
sessed Ron to d o it, but he more
than make up for it with the rest of
the track, were thankfully it doesn't
feature again. Zulu March uses
awesome c h o p p e d up beats and
deep b-lines, a nice dark stepper.
With Raid a menacing dark roller,
to mention a few of the tracks.
Prezioso. Raise The Power
(Truelove) 9th Feb.
4 mixes to choose from, all hard.
Original mix start off with just a
banging b-line (a great way to start)
hard 'n' fast beats, great acid beep
&. bleeps. I could not decide which
mix I liked best out of these, as
they are all so g o o d . Knuckle
H e a d z mix has definite old skool
feel to it, another banging 12" from
the Truelove stable.
Solar Stone. The Impressions EP
(Hooj) 9th Feb.
You get three mixes of Day By Day,
original is a trancy builder, that
drops into a deep pleasant break-
d o w n . 2nd is a more housey num-
ber, bouncy b-line, driven beats,
deep ' n ' dreamy. 3rd mix is a more
chilled version, stronger atmos-
pherics &. softer beats, one for
Sunday afternoon.
Dick Dastardly & Peter Perfect.
Rydim's At Ya EP. (Confetti Rec.)
9th Feb.
Starts out with a looped, stretched
& w a r p e d female vocal, beats
quickly build up over this, with jig-
gerly keyboard stabs working in
and out with a array of bleep 'n'
beats. G r o a n i n g bass-line s o o n
comes into play, with the clever
arrangements and an up-beat feel
sure to go d o w n well in the clubs.

Remixes (Clean Up.) 2nd Feb.
After it's phenomenal club success,
it's back with even more re-work-
ings, and sounding as fresh as the
day it was made. A classic set of
re-workings, using the Sneaker
Pimps lyrics to full effect, these
remixes just work so well. Sure to
get any crowd away from the bar
and on the floor.
Ten Years of the Roxy
V/A (Kubin)
Dutch ep to celebrate ten years of
the famous Roxy club in
A m s t e r d a m . Three great tracks
here, but I head straight for
Laidback Luke's S u b - C o n s c i o u s
every time. This is infectious, uplift-
ing, extremely funky and oh s o o o o
groovy: all at once!
Solyent Green
Solyent Green Z (Playhouse)
Playhouse is one of a small number
of labels that is making house min-
imal and, dare I say intelligent.
Three unnamed tracks create a
sound that is fiendish and daring.
Not quite Basic Channel, not quite
Robert H o o d . Sharp, precisely
placed bursts of sound make for a
tense, stretched a m b i e n c e .
Playhouse has had the guts to
carve its o w n niche and that
deserves my respect.

SkyUI>- The ? EP.
(Eye Q) 16th Feb.
A-side, is slow d o w n beat number,
haunting strings, slow drum pat-
tern, sad even depressing lyrics. A
dark trippy track, that breaks
d o w n to reversed lyrics and eerie
live bass taking you even deeper
in.
B-side, is less depressing, still
deep ' n ' dreamy, beautiful female
vocalist is used again, this one
more minimal, no drums at all,
simply clever use of electric guitar,
piano &. strings.
Courtney Pine.
Trying Times Remixes
(Talkin' Loud) Out Now.
You get three mixes of Trying
Times to choose from &. one remix
of Sense song by Raw Deal.
Two mixes by Headstrong, one
vocal, one dub. This down beat,
jazz fusion works quite well. Attic
Blues mix is more beaty, same
strong emotions and feeling.
A eclectic assortment of beats
that's great to just chill to.
Look out for an exclusive inter-
view with Courtney Pine next
week
