DOUGLAS ADAMS' STARSHIP TITANIC

Terry Jones
Remind you of the naked
organist?
S
t e m m i n g from a digression in
The Hitch-Hiker's Guide,
Starship Titanic is a novel by
Terry Jones. Douglas A d a m s was
unable to write the book himself as
he was working on a C D - R O M ver-
sion of it; his publishers insisted
that the novel would have to c o m e
out at the same time as the game
to enable them to sell it. This struck
A d a m s as o d d since they had
managed previously to sell books
of mine without any attendant C D -
R O M game." Whatevet, it came to
pass that A d a m s asked his old
friend, Terry Jones, to write it for
him. The ex-Python agreed with
only one proviso; he could write it
naked.
Surreal situations, silly names,
screwball antics and screwing as
well, all fuse together in the literary
pot to produce a deliciously enjoy-
able read. Written in the style of
The Hitch-Hiker's Guide, Jones
equals A d a m s ' quirkiness and if
not, he enhances it with the naugh-
tiness that only a naked man could
conjure. Shoddy workmanship by
the A m a l g a m a t e d U n m a r r i e d
Teenage M o t h e r ' s Construction
Unit leads to what appears to be
Spontaneous M a s s i v e Existence
Failure on the dawn of the Titanic's
unveiling to the universe. This is
where the real story begins.
The Titanic lands on Earth and
takes aboard Dan, Lucy and Nettie.
They link up with The Journalist
from the planet Blerontin w h o was
hidden aboard the ship with the
intention of gaining information for
a scoop about the Titanic's many
flaws. Our characters' objective is
to regain control of the ship. Along
the way they have to contend with
insolent Doorbots, pretentious
Deskbots, operatic Gondolabots
that sing when they don't have any
passengers, a talking bomb that
frequently loses count, the peace-
ful Yassacans with their Simulated
Destruction weapons and shoot-
to-miss policy, galactic bureaucra-
cy and, last but not least, a parrot!
Devilishly immature, Starship
Titanic is going to be a love-it-or-
hate-it book. O n e side will put for-
ward the fact that it is just stupid
while the other will say... Well,
they'll say that it's stupid too! If
you're looking for some satire, go
read a Ben Elton novel. However, if
you want a short read that is essen-
tially just stupid fun, Starship
Titanic has got its tadger out and is
wriggling past the rest of the pack
to take the c h e q u e r e d flag of
bonkers c o m e d y .

THE UNDERGROUND MAN
Mick Jackson
T
he Underground M a n is the
first novel from M i c k Jackson
and was shortlisted for the
Booker Prize last year. A s y o u
would then expect, it is an
extremely well written book.
Surprisingly, perhaps, it is also very
readable with a strong central char-
acter and a coherent and quickly
moving plot. The story is set in the
Victorian era and is about the fifth
Duke of Portland ('the
Underground M a n ' ) one of the
wealthiest landowners in the coun-
try. Through his journal, interleaved
with short reports from local resi-
dents, the story of a shy, eccentric
old man develops. The title refers
to the Duke's creation of a system
of tunnels underneath his estates
with great expense, where he
spends more and m o r e time.
Because of this and his social diffi-
culties and idiosyncrasies the local
c o m m u n i t y believe h i m to be
deformed or insane in some way.
"His left eye was a g o o d two inches
higher than the right one and he
dribble from the corner of his
mouth the whole time," was what
the locals believed the Duke (who
was completely normal) looked
like. The Duke, meanwhile, suffers
from an absence that he does not
understand and can only slowly
understand.
This is a superb book which I
would r e c o m m e n d to anyone. The
Duke is a sympathetic 'hero', and
his story is a fascinating one. As we
see the story almost entirely
through his journal we get a per-
sonal view and can relate to the
Duke a great deal. The story is
loosely based on the actual Duke
(William John Cavendish-Bentinck-
Scott) w h o did build such a net-
work of tunnels, but the book is
definitely fictitious. The secondary
characters, mainly the locals and
the Duke's staff are all well devel-
o p e d and entertaining. The short
reports between chapters from
such people give a more rounded
story, but, because of their preju-
dices these make us identify with
the Duke even more.
The story is above all a power-
ful, yet witty, story which grabs the
reader almost immediately. The
ending is an appropriate, but
shocking conclusion.
