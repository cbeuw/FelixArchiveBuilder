Rt Hon Gillian Shephard, Member
of Parliament for Norfolk South-
west and former Minister for
Education and Employment,
addressed a Consoc meeting on
Wednesday. She spoke briefly o n
the task of the Conservative party
in opposition, which she described
as "asking the unanswerable", and
her specialist area of Higher
Education.
M r s Shephard began by outlin-
ing the reasons w h y she felt the
Tories had lost the last General
Election, which she saw as prob-
lems of elector tedium, splits over
Europe, and the Party appearing
out-dated. She anticipates a c o m -
plete reform of Conservative Policy,
led by William Hague and Peter
Lilley's 'Listening to Britain' c a m -
paign, to be launched next month.
She emphasised that it is important
not to get too heavily bogged d o w n
by policy at this stage, citing M r s
Thatcher, w h o had "travelled light"
during the seventies.
M o v i n g on to attack Labour,
she r e s p o n d e d to Peter
M a n d e l s o n ' s
description of
the O p p o s i t i o n
as "pathetic",
claiming that
Labour t h e m -
selves are to
blame for the m
trivialisation of mgm
recent discussion flH
in the C o m m o n s ,
as they are
attempting to by
pass Parliament
completely, by • H
issuing press
releases to I
declare policy.
M r s Shepharc
Ministers either
avoid questions,
or claim that the subject is 'under
review'. Finally, she emphasised
that the process of devolution had
not been thoroughly thought out,
and no English voter had ever had
the chance to register their feeling
on the issue. Highlighting her o w n
case, she
claimed that the
p e o p l e of
Norfolk feel no
desire to merge
with H e r t f o r d -
shire or Essex in
a potential new
regional assem-
bly for East
Anglia.
M o v i n g o n
to the Higher
E d u c a t i o n
debate, M r s
Shephard a d d e d
that a compre-
hensive overhaul
of the University
system was nec-
essary, c o n s i d -
ering the mas-
sive increases in student numbers
since the issue was last addressed
in the sixties. The key is, according
to M s Shephard, to ensure that
public money is fairly distributed "to
maximise quality and choice". She
feels that this w o u l d best be
achieved by attaching funding to
individual students, so that they
bring funding with them to their
university, thus increasing competi-
tion amongst H E institutions. M o r e
importantly, M r s Shephard empha-
sised that a Conservative govern-
ment would not have abolished the
maintenance grant, but would have
m o v e d to cap student numbers,
with M r s Shephard for one feeling
that any further increases in num-
bers w o u l d be detrimental. Her
concluding c o m m e n t s focused on
the need to increase the respect
given to Higher Education - partic-
ularly the ' n e w ' universities.
S p e a k i n g in their defence, she
pointed out that "in my day you
could get a degree in sport at
Oxford. It would have been called
English or History or something,
but basically it w o u l d have been a
degree in sport".

Club Bedford is a Bunch of Arse'

He went on to explain that this act
of wanton destruction c a m e as a
particular blow to the club from a
financial as well as a logistical point
of view, but was certain that club
would "just get on". The bus, which
was estimated to be w o r t h
£ 1 5 , 0 0 0 , suffered irreparable d a m -
age as a result of rust, ruined
electrics and sodden upholstery.
Jules Davenport stated "it looks
okay, but nothing works and every
now and again a bit more water
runs out from somewhere." The
minibus was officially declared a
write-off by insurers last week and
plans are n o w being m a d e to pur-
chase a second-hand replacement.
Felix has been informed that the
insurance c o m p a n y plan to reim-
burse the Boat Club about £ 7 , 0 0 0 .
The Boat Club originally
obtained the minibus under a cloud
of controversy. The facilitating
grant was awarded by an IC sports
fund k n o w n as the Harlington
Trust, but almost immediately
afterwards the trust decided that it
would no longer consider applica-
tions for club minibuses. Frank
M u r r a y , the sports and leisure
manager, justified the move, c o m -
menting "it is essential the club gets
to regattas." H e went o n to
describe the sizeable amount of
equipment required for the meets
which are invariably held significant
distances away from college.
The Boat Club is currently hiring
out buses through the union, which
brings them into line with other
clubs and societies. Frank Murray
outlined plans for financing a
replacement minibus, suggesting
that a request to the Harlington
Fund could make up the balance
after the insurance pay-out.

the root of the problem: "The can-
didates stand as individuals, not as
potential members... most are just
after CV points and don't realise
the c o m m i t m e n t involved".
If the motion of no-confidence
is passed (or if, as has been
rumoured, M r Bhalla resigns) a
temporary President will be elect-
ed by the O M C , until the results of
the C&JGU elections are
announced on 3 M a r c h . The newly
elected President would then take-
over immediately. It is h o p e d that
this move would provide the nec-
essary catalyst to begin the
process of renewal in Guilds. In the
words of Selina Vinayaga-Pavan,
C&X. Publicity and Welfare Officer,
"Exec is supposed to be a team,
and we have finally realised that to
function properly we need that
team - but every team needs a
captain".
Looking to the future, it is
realised that the p r o b l e m s of
CJkGU cannot be solved i m m e d i -
ately, and go back far beyond this
year - Eric A l l s o p , former ICU
President, suggested that C & C U
had been going downhill since he
c a m e to Imperial in 1989.
However, A n d y Heeps comment-
ed that whilst no overnight
changes can be e x p e c t e d , he
w o u l d like to see Guilds "taking the
first steps... reviewing their consti-
tution, sorting out their finances,
and building up a solid first step in
the chain of the c o m m a n d " . M r
Heeps p r o m i s e d that only if such
steps fail to be achieved will he
use his newly mandated powers to
take greater control of the running
of C&X,.
