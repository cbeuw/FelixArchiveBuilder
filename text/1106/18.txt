SHOPPING AND FLICKING
Mark Ravenhill
T
he scene: a r o o m filled with
people newly in from the
cold, adjusting their dress,
chattering, turning to neighbours, all
nicely relaxed, until - B A N G ! W e
are hit by a thunderbolt of sound, a
disjointed, harsh-voiced rant
against life in general, ripping
through the now total blackness
over a thudding beat. W i n d e d so to
speak by the onslaught, w e turn to
the stage, unusually sparsely fur-
nished, and dominated by a large
screen to the rear, on which lighted
lettering forms the title of the play.
W e see a scene in the home of our
main characters. These three are
occupied in picking at the
microwave meals which appear
throughout the play, but which
Mark refuses to touch so that his
companions attempt to feed him
from their own plates, thus creating
an odd parent-child tableau.
The plot of this play is far too
involved and bewildering to attempt
to even summarise here, and any-
way that would s o m e h o w defeat
the object of my trying to persuade
you to see it, (which, incidentally,
you definitely should.) At Lulu's
and Robbie's request, M a r k relates
the apparently beloved tale of his
first meeting with them. A stranger
had pointed to a nearby couple and
told Mark that he owned them, but
•that they were trash and he didn't
want them, even hated them , and
he'd offered them to Mark for £20.
They'd "done a deal," and Mark had
taken Robbie and Lulu home to be
his "slaves." This is where the "shop-
ping" of the title comes in, and the
idea recurs throughout the play in
various forms, adding a really surre-
al (and not a little confusing,) ele-
ment to the entire thing.
As the play progresses, with
scene changes indicated very effec-
tively by the lighted lettering
behind. U p to this point, the acting
had been a little slow and stilted,
and I've had the distinct feeling that
the cast are having difficulty in filling
the enormous, bare stage, but the
performances are beginning to
strengthen, along with the cohesion
of the group. The first act ends on
a note of suspense, but that's as
much as I can give away
The salvo of rapid-fire sound
which hurls us headlong into the
second act is no less of a jolt than
that at the beginning - absolutely no
danger of sleeping through the first
five minutes. As the second act
begins we are launched into the
extraordinary scene of Robbie's
and Lulu's home with each engaged
in a telephone conversation, which,
it soon becomes apparent, is phone
sex; they are making a last ditch
attempt to raise the £ 3 0 0 0 which
they by now owe to Brian. During
the course of this, other telephones
ring, so that both Lulu and Robbie
are holding two simultaneous con-
versations, juggling subject matter
and even voices.
Throughout the play, Gary has
been mentioning a wealthy man
who is "out there" and w h o will take
him back to his luxurious home for
g o o d . He goes into greater and
greater detail, until he is describing
a vision of being a possession, con-
trolled completely, and he begins to
see M a r k as the one w h o will
become his master. Gary then
encounters Robbie and lulu for the
first time, and they agree to "help"
him, by recreating his vision. They
manipulate his words so that his
vision becomes exactly the "trans-
action" of M a r k ' s story, and is
played out in gruesome and menac-
ing detail. This is where the "fuck-
ing" part comes in; this is the one
thing on which the shock value of
the play is said to depend, but to
me it is shocking more for its appar-
ent coldness, and for Gary's sub-
mission to what he believes to be
necessary for the enactment of his
vision, than for the act itself. 1 find
the mind-games and manipulation
surrounding it, and the fact that
Robbie is in fact giving Gary precise-
ly what he has asked for, far more
horrifying. This scene, with its stark
writing and powerful acting, is to
me the most effective of the play.
It is very difficult to come to any
definite conclusion as to what Mark
Ravenhill is trying to achieve with
this play. At this point in time I
would say that it is an exploration of
ideas on d e p e n d e n c e , both on
other human beings and on money,
and the ways in which the depen-
dence on one another of the m e m -
bers of a group affects all their lives.
The w h o l e thing is certainly
extremely thought provoking, and
succeeded in captivating me from
beginning to end.
