I'm fed up. I'm more fed up
than I've been since I took
over as FELIX Editor. I've
spent most of this week
reading the annual reports
of the Union officers. I've
never read such a load of
rubbish. Try and read the 9
pages of reports included
in this week's FELIX. In
these reports almost every
officer attempts to bitch
about the people they don't
I like and praise their friends.
There are some which are
extremely unpleasant
personal attacks on people
who've put a lot of time
into the Union. Perhaps
people should remember
their own faults before they
start attacking other
, people. This year has been
i a poor one for the Union.
, People should be trying to
find out what went wrong.
They shouldn't be
attempting to put the blame
on others. I wish certain
Union Officers would grow
up and stop acting like
spoilt children
FELIX has been attacked
by Union President Carl
Burgess. He accuses me of
filling FELIX with 'esoteric
and incomprehensible
articles' and ignoring the
ordinary student. He has
accused me of factual
inaccuracies. (Read the
section of the report on
FELIX, it's on page 2 of the
reports under Pub Board).
If the report is passed by
the A G M I will have to
consider my position and
may well resign.
You've read FELIX this
year. I think its reported

facts and reflected your
interests fully. You've read
FELIX so you know if I'm
right or wrong. If you want
to defend FELIX's right to
criticise the Union come to
the U G M and oppose Carl's
report before the end of
term. If you agree with Carl
and think FELIX has been a
waste of money this year
come and support the
report so that I resign and
save the Union some
money.
Hall Rents
The College has decided to
raise rents in halls and
houses by an average of
5.35%. The undergraduate
grant next year will be 2%
higher than the grant this
year. This means that
students living in hall will
yet again have less to
spend in real terms on
food, books etc then they
had the year before. The
Government is making life
difficultfor students . There
is no need for the college
to help them. When the
Conservative government
came to power, it was still
true that most people could
afford to come to College.
Now you generally need
parental support. The class
of 86 are being supported
by their middle class
parents. Imperial is trying
to attract the best students
by offering the best
courses. There's no point
having the best courses in
the country if there's
nowhere for your students
to live. The most alarming
thing is the fact that the
Union didn't oppose these
price increases.
Credits
Normally I use this section
of FELIX to thank the
people who've helped on
the issue. As this may be
my last issue I'd like to
thank all the people who've
helped on FELIX this year. I
think that together we've
produced some good
FELIXs and I'd like to thank
you all for your efforts.
You've all worked far too
hard and I disagree with
everything Carl and others
have said about you. I don't
really know how to express
my appreciation sufficiently
but I hope thanks will do.
Thanks.
