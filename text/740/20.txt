19% Cut For !C
(continued from front page)
were introduced in 1979, he
claimed. He thought the
present proportion of 19%
could be increased up to
25%, but that it shouldn't
become too high or some
research groups would
become entirely dependant
on overseas students.
There is, he said, an
imbalance of overseas
students between
departments which should
be corrected.
When asked by a lecturer
what he thought could be
done about the shortage of
accommodation, the Rector
pointed out that money
raised from gravel
extraction at Harlington
could be used to fund a
new residence, and that he
was making efforts to
obtain additional money for
residences. He said he
thought .that Head Tenancy
schemes were a 'cracking
good idea', despite the fact
that the number of such
, schemes is in decline.
FELIX
Plans
College have drawn up
plans for the new FELIX
office. FELIX Editor Hugh
Southey and FELIX Editor
Elect Dave Jones are
understood to be unhappy
about the plans as they feel
that the office will not be
big enough for the FELIX's
needs.
IC Sports
Aid
Students at Imperial
College are contributing to
the preparations for Sports
Aid.
IC Radio have made the
tapes for the Sports Aid
phone line. Members of the
station went to the
Hippodrome to interview
Bob Geldof and other stars.
IC Keep Fit Club are
organising a series of work
outs for people taking part
in the runs. Students living
in Falmouth Keogh were
among the first to enter the
charity run.
If you want to take part
in the run fill in the form in
last week's FELIX.
CCU AG Ms
RCS And Guilds held their
A G M s on Tuesday. The
trouserless boat race and
the initiation went ahead
without any problems.
Pascal Carr, though,
crashed a van on his way
to pick up Theta, the R C S
Mascot. (Photographs next
week).
Stolen
An electronic typewriter
was stolen from the Union
Office sometime last
weekend. The theft was not
discovered until the office
was opened on Monday.
Security have been
informed, but there is as
yet no news of the
typewriter's fate. The Union
Office have appealed to
anyone who may have
borrowed the typewriter to
return it. Chief Security
Officer Geoff Reeves said
that he was not ruling out
foul play.
Correction
The following are late
changes to Dave Kingston's
report:
Under Finance: Last line of
first column between
'agreement' and 'but' insert
'with Industrial Society'.
Under Transport: 'Jenny'
should read 'Jerry'.
Under Bar Boycott: add
'Gareth Fish' to the list of
officers.
Under Carl and Quentin:
The final sentance should
read 'I cannot think of one
plan or objective taken on
by ICU this year which has
not been achieved-usually
by Carl'.
FELIX would like to
appologise for these
mistakes.
