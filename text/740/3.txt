Waitrose Again....
Dear Hugh
Please find enclosed a copy of a letter I have sent to the
Manager of the Waitrose supermarket in Gloucester Rd. In
the wake of the letter which appeared in the FELIX issue
number 738
Dear Sir or M a d a m
Y o u will shortlly receive, or perhaps have already received,
a letter-petition signed by the staff and students of Imperial
College requesting y o u to c e a s e selling South African
produce. A s a student at Imperial C o l l e g e and a regular
customer of your supermarket, I would ask and advise you
to ignore the aforementioned letter. It is written by a very
small group of well-intentioned but extremely naive and
misguided people who claim to represent the eight
thousand students and staff at Imperial C o l l e g e but in fact
represent a totally insignificant proportion of them.
It must be very clear to you that by stocking South African
produce you are in fact helping the black population of
South Africa by providing them with an export market. A s a
large amount of South Africa's black population is
employed in agriculture, this c a n only be to their
advantage. In addition, people in general a n d students in
particular tend to buy whatever food is cheapest, best
value for money or has the best taste. If any of your South
Afriican g o o d s fall into o n e of these categories and you
c e a s e to stock them, then w e shall be obliged to s h o p
elsewhere. A n d let m e assure you that w e represent the
vast majority of your customers.
Yours faithfully,
AlastairJ Seymour
Charity: Right Or Wrong
Dear H u g h ,
I w a s very glad to read your editorial on charity.Indeed, if
charity stops people from facing the real issues, nothing
could be worse. Therefore, two questions arise: First, is this
what charity actually d o e s ? a n d s e c o n d , is there a place for
it here and n o w ?
Large charities s u c h as O x f a m have gone a long way
towards b e c o m i n g political pressure groups. Most charities
involved in the Third World do now look at the root of the
flag activities are 'attended because of the fun involved'
problems rather than try to c o v e r them up or quieten s o m e
middle c l a s s c o n s c i e n c e s . T h e r e has been a time when
charities, especially those supporting (or having their roots
in) the C h u r c h treated suffering people as the favourite
pastime of their m e m b e r s . E v e n our R a g activities are
mostly attended b e c a u s e of the fun involved rather than
b e c a u s e of the c a u s e they serve.
However, many charities play a major role in the solution of
problems. T h e c a s e of charities for disabled people which
contributed towards major achievements in terms of
legalisation by forming nuclei around which groups were
formed a n d s a y w a s given to the people involved is o n e
example. V S O , which a s k s for much more than a few
pennies, is another. Every charity must have a s its target
the final solution of the problems but this d o e s not m e a n
that it shouldn't treat them as best a s possible in the
meanwhile.
There are issues, like world hunger, where charity as such
is inadequate. This is not always the c a s e . T h e R N L I is a
charity supported organisation which deals effectively with
its object. Charity doesn't H A V E to be ineffective, neither
has it got to turn people away from the real problems.
Furthermore, there is a place in the world for them. Not
everything c a n be dealt with directly by the state, and
services that c a n effectively rely directly on the public
should stay clear from the muddy waters of party interests.
P e o p l e often support or o p p o s e a certain c a u s e just
b e c a u s e it is 'their' party's general policy. Charities c a n
often unite people from different ideologies on big issues
whereas parties c a n divide them on the s a m e issues.
H e n c e the value of charities as fairly objective presssure
groups.
Finally, let me point out that w e should attatch a great value
to the h u m a n individual. S a v i n g a single child from hunger
or d i s e a s e is not comparable to painting o n e square foot of
the wall of a hundred-foot-tall building w h o s e f a c a d e is
worn and b l a c k e n e d . It m a k e s no difference to the building
but it m a k e s a world of difference to the child. A s long a s
charities d o s a v e lives, even a few, w e have to k e e p them.
Therefore let us give as m u c h as possible: Not only our
pennies but also our time, our thought, our effort for those
in need. (A very good opportunity c o m e s this week,
Christian Aid week. C A works on agricultural development,
health education and, a b o v e all, to e m p o w e r people to win
their o w n fight against poverty and suffering. S o dig d e e p
into your pockets, think hard and take action!)
Yours,
