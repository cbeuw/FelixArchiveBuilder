This week the column which
brings you more
pretentiousness than a Time
Out review of Gucci
jockstraps (and which inspired
not only the infamous
Neasden toothbrush massacre
but also several nasty lies in
Carl Burgess' report) starts
with a letter. It came to me by
airmail (ie wrapped around a
flying brick which was
delivered via the window) and
begins:
Dear Short Scruffy Git,
I am an engineering student.
You probably won't know what
one of them is so I will explain.
We are the poor hard-working
bastards who are supposed to
become tomorrow's Captains of
Industry. I say 'supposed'
because information has come
into my hands that by next
Tuesday 98% of British
manufacturing industry will
either be closed down or sold
to the United States. This
means that the highest I am
ever likely to get is Lance
Corporal in Sikorsky. Further,
I have a friend who fixes the
photocopier at the Ministry of
Defence (or is it Love, I can
never remember?). He says thai
he's seen a letter from Reagan
saying that they can't make
their space rockets work. This
means they are having trouble
with their plans to colonise
Mars by 2015AD and are
looking for somewhere a little
closer to home. In fact, the
number two contender (after
Nicaragua) is the UK. It seems
that Maggie and George
Younger are flogging the place
to Ronnie under the banner of
privatisation for use as an
aircraft carrier (it seems
they're a bit nervous of using
theirs at the moment 'cos
they've all got nuclear
reactors). What I want to know
is what good is a column load
of arty claptrap about people
who carve ludicrous Indian
fertility symbols out of Mk 3
Ford Cortinas to me - a
penniless waif looking only for
the chance of a career (or
alternatively, suspended
animation as a Chartered
Accountant). Answer that one
smart guy

Well Eric this column is for
those of you for whom college
has temporarily become too
much. It is perhaps the wrong
time to suggest ideas for going
out with most of us obsessed
with exams. But I have found
in the past that taking a break
is still necessary in order to
relax and is no problem as
long as you do actually do
some work.
It seems to me that now is
a very good time to get out of
college. The atmosphere
around the union when some
of the 'senior' figures are
around is frankly ridiculous.
The amount of flying hatchets
and spiteful outbursts going
on makes Eastenders look
tame. The only positive thing
to do is look forward to a
really beezer year next year
when all the sickening
backslapping awards and
slagging matches are in the
past.
Tonight I'm probably off to
the Clarendon in
Hammersmith to see revived
rock poet and refugee from
seventies acid heads
Hawkwind, Bob Calvert. The
support act are current Janice
Long faves Zodiac Mindwarp
who I might add featured in
this column sometime back.
This could be your last chance

to go to one of West
London's better known rock
venues as the Clarendon is
closing down due to
redevelopment.
Tomorrow (Saturday) sees
an event in college that could
be a change from the usual
beer promos etc. Kev Buckley
is running a Rock Disco in
the Union Lounge Bar. This is
the sort of new idea that
needs to be tried to build up
our recently acquired asset, so
go along and support it.
Lastly to records. The
resuscitation of the Velvet
Underground on the South
Bank Show seems to have
brought on a Pavlovian rush
for everything even remotely

linked in — down to the Jesus
and Mary Chain's cast off
underwear. It seems almost
the only way to get credibility
in the rock world at the
moment is to claim the
influence of Messrs Reed,
Morrison, Cale and Tucker. A
pity then that the £25 boxed
set of Velvet re-releases is
such poor value. The
Underground definitely had
their bursts of brilliance but
n k -
all this set does is pad it out
with hours of what is really
very average music.
My personal favourite
album at the moment is 'The
World By Storm' by the
Three Johns. The Johns
manage to combine incisive
political lyrics with a raw but
danceable sound. Where the
Smiths are merely miserable,
the Three Johns rip along
with no compromise rock
which has the potential to
take radical sound into the
commercial charts. Fitting
that their songs should have
such catching titles as Atom
Drum Bop. Catchier even
than Eugene Zhog sings 20
great Albanian cycling songs...
