FILM
He Died With His Eyes
Open is a French film taken
from the book of the same
name by the English author
Derek Raymond
(pseudonym Robin Cook)
who has found great
success in France but who
is virtually unknown in
Britain
Michael Serrault
(excellent in 'La Cage Aux
Folles') plays the standard
hard independant cop,
Inspector Stanisland,
determined to find out who
[savagedly killed a man
found by a railway track.
He quickly comes across
Barbara, Charlotte
Rampling, a femme fatale,
who appears one day when
Stanisland is listening to
some tapes of the victim in
the victim's flat. As may be
expected from misogynistic
tales of femme fatales, the
woman in question gets her
just deserts, punished for
her sexuality.
The film too is rather
predictable full of
unimaginative and cliche
ridden direction. I can't
really recommend it on any
level, inspite of the
marvellous M Serrault, and
THEATRE
Fail/safe is a story of four
women and their ties to
each other. By looking at
their lives, Fail/Safe
examines a variety of
emotions, ranging from
guilt and jealousy to
lonliness, emotional
blackmail, communication
and the problems of facing
old age.
There are two separate
front rooms through which
the audience must pass to
take their 'Fly on the wall'
seats. One is occupied by
Gwen, her sister Ella, and
daughter Jo on a Summer
Saturday. The other, by
Mavis, who is periodically
visited by Jo during the
month preceeding the
action occuring in Gwen's
room.
Essentially the plot in
Gwen's home revolves
around the 42 year old Jo,
who has only recently
managed to move out and
returns for the weekend.
Torn by feelings of anger
and guilt, Jo superficially
blames her mother for the
inadequacy she feels, but
she is fully aware that her
faults lie chiefly within
herself. Jo's return to the
nest makes her feel ill at
ease, and her ambivilance

It is now two years since
1984, the Orwell bonanza
year, so by now all those
discarded Animal Farms
should be making their way
on to the second hand
bookshelves. Homage to
Catalonia is one of Orwell's
brilliant but lesser
recognised works,
describing his part in the
Spanish Civil War, which
was the equivalent of Korea
where both US and USSR
gave aid to the same side.
The fighting, the lice in the
trouser seams, dogs
branded with revolutionary
slogans and Italian fascists
machine-gunning civilian
refugees at Malaga are all
described clearly and
objectively. The early
euphoric war gave way to
bickering between the
Communists and
Anarchists, which
disillusioned Orwell and left
him and his comrades in
the International Brigade
marked as traitors. After
being wounded in the neck,
he, his wife and a fellow
soldier escaped over the
French border, fleeing from
the people that they had
fought for.
The best parts of the
book are the concluding
discussions of the nature of
propaganda, government,
fascism, false and real
atrocities, which are much
more worthwhile than the
pontifications of non-
combatant English
intellectuals. Orwell's
humanity, humour and
vision are well expressed in
this book, published by
Penguin for £1.95.
possibly because of the
rather ham MS Rampling.
Finally to complete the
theme of women and film,
the ICA is running a series
of exploitation films
directed by women. Amy
Jones Love Letters
reviewed last week, is now
showing at several Cannon
Cinemans and Slumber
Party Masaccre and
Streetwalking are showing
as a double bill at the ICA.
I've not seen the former,
but the latter is a rather sad
and unpleasant
documentary style film
about a young runnaway
and her life with the
prostitutes in the big city.
the emotional blanket many
years previously, emerges.
Jo works as a 'rep' for a
pet food firm, allowing an
opening for her to meet,
and subsequently visit
Mavis, a lonely 80 year old
with only her cat Suzi for
company. Jo's visits afford
her a way of offsetting the
guilt she feels regarding
her mother.
The performance given
by Helena McCarthy, a real
old lady, as Mavis, is one of
the most impressive I have
ever witnessed. Her
manipulative qualities
coupled with her very real
effect a powerful and
emotional response from
the audience.
Inevitably it seems that
Jo will return to the 'womb'
never having experienced
life in the way she wanted
to . Much of her anger
seems to be due to the fact
that she is fully aware that
what she is, and what she
desires to be, are a world
apart.
'Life is too short mum...it
bloody well is...You end up |
a stinking lump turning to
shit..'
Fail/Safe is a play about
women, but equally deals
with emotions that effect us
all; men, sadly, seem to use
fewer words. Fail/Safe
should not be missed.
