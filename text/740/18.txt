Rag Chairman
, Raffle for a guaranteed place
| in hall of any choice.
I Now that the annual
accommodation fever has
eventually hit the College,
students will now be
looking for somewhere to
live next year through
addresses supplied by
students services or
through any other source
they might find.
It is a frustrating, long
and very tiring process,
except for the very
fortunate few, each student
will eventually succumb
and tread this path.
Student Services
recognise the problems
students face and try their
utmost to help. The normal
IC accommodation
regulation only guarantees
one place in hall/house for
one year per student. This
limits most students to one
year in hall or house.
However this year,
Student Services Manager
Don Ferguson has
obtained one place In hall
which he is offering to
students of IC and who are
now looking for
accommodation next
academic year. To be
completely fair as to whom
this place will go, the
guaranteed place in
hall/house of any choice
will be won by a raffle
which will only run for Two
weeks maximum starting
Friday 9th May. Since this
was Man Tai's idea, the
proceeds from the raffle
shall go to Rag and their
charities (MENCAP,
National Society for Deaf
Children, RADAR) .There
are certain regulations for
entering this raffle:-
1 You must be a student of IC
at the beginning of next
academic year.
2 You must not have spent
more than one year in IC
hall/house.
3 You must not have an
o u t s t a n d i n g bill f r o m
Student Services.
If you are eligible to
enter and are looking for
accommodation next year,
then buy some tickets.
Someone has to be
allocated the place in hall,
Dumb, Dumber and
Dumbest, three clever IC
students managed to get
themselves locked in the
Queens Tower after it had
been opened at the Rag
Fete. Rather than call for
help like any normal people
they decided to get down
themselves from the lower
balcony. They found a
piece of rope the length of
which was twice their
distance from the
ground and a 30kg rock to
use as a counterweight. By
looping the rope around a
pillar and lowering the rock
to the ground they formed
a pulley system. Dumb
weighted 78kg, Dumber
66kg, and Dumbest 36kg
(he was on a diet at the
time). The trouble was that,
being very clever students,
they realised that if the
difference between the
weight at the ends of the
rope was more than 6kg
then they would get injured
while being lowered. If a
maximum of two people, or
one person and the rock,
could hold onto one end of
the rope, what is the
minimum number of moves
(up or down) it would take
to get all three to the
ground?
Anwsers to the FELIX
office by 1.00pm
Wednesday, please. The
answers to Dodgy dice and
the winner will appear next
week.
and the number of tickets
you can buy are unlimited
per person (only 1000
tickets available). The
proceeds will be going to a
good cause, both for Rag
and for yourself.
Tickets are 50p each, and
will be on sale from
Student Services and the
Union Office for two weeks.
The draw for the
guaranteed place in hall
will be made by a mystery
celebrity. On Friday 23rd
May 1.00pm. The winner
will be published in FELIX
and then referred to Don to
'Collect' his prize.
Financial benefits are
obvious from living in hall,
as is the location and
proximity of other students
for social life.
Accommodation is like a
lottery every year, and
student Services urge
everyone looking for it to
take any chances which
arise. However, to enter
this raffle, you must satisfy
the 3 requirements first
before you are eligible. To
anyone now looking for
accommodation or thinking
of it, good luck-it's hard
work.

Sports Day
Imperial College Sports D a y w a s held on a warm
sunny W e d n e s d a y 23rd April a n d s a w thirty ( aspiring /
inspiring I!) athletes trek d o w n to the University track al
M o t s p u r P a r k in S u r r e y . A l t h o u g h the turnout w a s
s o m e w h a t d i s a p p o i n t i n g e v e r y o n e w h o t o o k part
appeared to have a really g o o d time.
T h e four ladies w h o took part participated in
virtually every event ( s o r r y girls, you c a n pole vault next
y e a r ) and n o n e w a l k e d a w a y empty h a n d e d . A s for the
men, the needle m a t c h e s in the sprints never turned out
to be with S a m 'I could run 3 s e c o n d s faster over 100 if I
put d o w n my g l a s s e s a n d left my getto blaster behind'
N c h i n d a leaving a n injured R o g e r L o u g h n e y for dust (
literally if y o u k n o w M o t s p u r P a r k ! ). In the middle
distance events anything that Bryan G a m b l i n entered he
w o n ; however he elected to miss the 800 which w a s won
c o n v i n c i n g l y by Phil T u r n e r . J o n L e a , d e f e n d i n g his
3 0 0 0 m title failed to s t e m the G a m b l i n tide d e s p i t e
relaxing all afternoon in a C h e m E n g Final e x a m . In the
field events, anything that P e t e S e d d e r s threw basically
went a long w a y a n d certainly further than anyone else
could m a n a g e . J o h n P o p e , Athletics S e c , will certainly
not b e r e m e m b e r e d for his athletic a c h i e v e m e n t s at
Sports D a y w h e r e in the 1 1 0 m Hurdles his race finished
abruptly at, or rather o n ( o u c h I ), the s e c o n d flight.
Further, he p r o b a b l y w o n the w a l k partly b e c a u s e it
would have t a k e n T e c h n i c a l merit / Artistic Impression'
judges to determine exactly w h o w a s cheating the most
c.nd partly b e c a u s e he w a s in charge !
N e x t y e a r I C S p o r t s will b e o n t h e first
W e d n e s d a y of the S u m m e r term. P l e a s e , if you are here
next year a n d y o u are e v e n only slightly interested make
a note in your diary now - this g o e s for e x e c s a s well ~ i
o n e afternoon is going to m a k e the difference b e t w e e n
p a s s and fail in your e x a m s next year you will be in d e e p
trouble : with a big c r o w d of people next year this fixture
should be t r e m e n d o u s fun.
