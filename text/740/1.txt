Rents Up 5.35%
Rents in College halls and
houses for the 1986/87 session
are to go up by an average of
5.35%, compared with a rise of
only 2% in student grants. The
increase was decided at the
Student Residence Committee
(SRC) on Wednesday, and was
not opposed by Union
representatives at the meeting.
The rise also brings a
restructuring in the relative
prices of halls and houses. The
more popular halls in Princes
Gardens receive large increases
of upto £5 per week, whilst
houses have in certain cases
been reduced. Bernard Sunley
and Mining Houses are to
receive rent cuts of between £1
and £2 per week, however the
upgraded houses like Willis
Jackson and Holbein receive
small increases.
The committee report claimed
that even the highest rent of
£32.66 is lower than the average
private sector rent paid by IC
students of £35 per week from
data supplied by Student
Services.
Weeks and Linstead Halls are
to become the most expensive
accommodation with single
rooms costing £32.66 and
£31.61 respectively, increased
from £27.30. However a triple in
Mining House goes from £13.65
to £11.59.
Carl Must Wait
ICU President Carl Burgess will
have to wait until the end of
term before Council decides if
he is to be awarded a Union
General Award (UGA).
Monday's meeting of Council
ended controversially when
quorum was successfully
challenged during the
discussion of the award.
The U G A is the highest award
which the Union can give and is
normally awarded by the
retiring President to students
who have made an outstanding
contribution to the Union
during their time at College.
ICU Council decide whether an
award should be made to the
President but there were
insufficent officers present to
continue the discussion after
some members of Council had
questioned whether the award
should be made. The decision
will now be postponed until
joint Council on Monday June
16.
Earlier Council had voted to
award final colours to External
Affairs Officer Grenville Manuel
and Welfare Officer Pete
Wilson. The Social Colours
Committee had originally not
reccommended either for an
award.
10% Cut For IC
A cut in Government funding of
10% over the next five years is
expected by the Rector,
equivalent to the loss of 50
academic staff unless
alternative funding can be
found. This assumes that the
College will do no better than
average in the present round of
cuts now being planned by the
University Grants Committee
(UGC).
The Rector, Professor Ash,
made this prediction whilst
addressing the A G M of the
Academic Staff Assembly, the
body of academic staff at IC, on
Wednesday. About 120 lecturers
heard the Rector speak and
answer questions for about 45
minutes.
The Government has told the
U G C to cut the universities by
2% per annum for five years in
real terms. The U G C is
presently assessing how to
distribute this cut amongst the
universities, and it is expected
to hit some institutions harder
than others. The two criteria
being used are the quality of
research and the staff/student
ratio at each institution, with the
latter having twice the
weighting of the former. Whilst
IC scores well on the first
criteria, research, it suffers from
having a staff:student ratio of
Prof Ash: worried about cuts
only 1:8, compared with 1:10
average nationally. It seems
likely therefore that the College
cannot expect to do better than
average according" to the
Rector. The special treatment
the college received in the past
will not, he believes, continue.
The only consolation is that the
damage to IC is expected to be
'containable'.
What this means in practice,
said the Rector, is that the
College must fund about 50
lectureships-from industry if it is
to avoid losing posts. The
alternative would be to allow for
natural wastage to cut 10% off
the number of staff, which
would happen in an unplanned
way, and result in a static,
demoralised staff. He thought
that industry would find it more
financially attractive to pay for a
lecturer post than to employ
someone directly, and that it
was possible for the necessary
number of posts to be funded
over tWe five year period.
Earlier in his speech the
Rector described recruitment of
students as IC's biggest
problem. Whereas the College
had not had to worry in the past
it was now under pressure
because of the fall in the
number of 18 year olds and
increasing competition from
other universities. The College
has only recruited 900 home
students this year against a
target of 1000. The U G C would
penalise consistent shortfalls
financially, he thought, making
it essential to meet the target.
Departments should put more
effort into attracting students,
for example by producing
glossy brochures, he said.
The numbers of overseas
students are now back to the
level when full-cost fees
