Aids: The Search For A Cure
T h e fight g o e s o o o n to try to find a cure or vaccine for acquired
immune deficiency s y n d r o m (AIDS). A cure cannot c o m e to
soon-by M a r c h this year 10,000 people had died from aids,
and 8,000 are dying now. T h e aids deathtoll in Britain alone will
be 3,000 by 1989 according to the public health laboratory in
London. More than 160 people have already died form A i d s in
the U K since it w a s discovered innn 1981.
Aids is c a u s e d by a virus-a roughly spherical bundle of protein
containing a single strand of the nuclleic acid R N A . Viruses
work by invading host cells' and they are usually specific too
quite a narrow range of hosts. T h e aids viirus is specific to
T-lymphoccylee cells. T h e virus binds to the surface of the cell,
and the viral R N A and protein are injected. A n e n z y m e in teh
virus called reverse transriptase, transcribes the viral R N A into
D N A which c a n then be incorpporated into the host cell's
g e n e s . T h e viral g e n e s stage a takover of the cell's machinery,
and instruct it to produce replicas of the infecting virus particles
are produced that the cell simply bursts. Alternatively the virus
particles c a n b e released o n e at a time, while the host cell
continues to live, grow, and reprduce. Either way, the n e w
viruses c a n then g o off in s e a r c h of more cells to infect and kill.
Another theory is that the virus c a u s e s the T-lymphocyte cells
to produce lymmphtoootoxins which kill the cells
T h e cells that aids destroys-T-llymphocyte cells- are special
white blood cells produced to the thymus (a gland in the kneck)
They are vital to the body's defence m e c a n i s m , which in a
healthy person produces antibodies to ward off invading cells
or viruses, in a patient suffering from Aids, the lymphhocytes
are killed a n d the d e f e n c e m e c h a n i s m breaks down. Patients
do not die from Aids- they die form o n e of many different
aillments that the d e f e n c e m e c h a n i s m would ordinarily deal
with.
A s s o o n a s scientists discovered that A i d s w a s c a u s e d by a
virus, they began to look for a vaccine to use against it.
V a c c i n e s work by initiating the production of antibodies specific
for the virus. T h e antibodies bind to the virus and render it
unable to invade the host cell. But unfortunately it has b e e n
impossible, s o far, to produce a vaccine specific for Aids,
b e c a u s e the virus responsible for A i d s k e e p s changing its
configuration. A n d it is difficult to b e specific for something that
k e e p s c h a n g i n g .
T h e approach to the problem being adopted by s o m e scientists
is to find s o m e part of the virus that d o e s not c h a n g e . T h e most
likely candidate s o far s e e m s to b e a component of the virus
coat, a protein called G P - 1 2 0 . G P - 1 2 0 has b e e n purified from
cultured A i d s virus and injected into animals. T h e animals
produce antibodies which, in the test tube, kill the A i d s virus.
T h e next stage in testing this, or any other vaccine, will b e to
"challenge" vaccinated animals with A i d s virus, and s e e if it
affords protection: tests could then begin o n h u m a n s .
O n e researcher has e x p r e s s e d the g e n e for G P - 1 2 0 in
vaccinia the virus from which the smallpox vaccine is m a d e .
Vaccinia is extremely g o o d at transferring foreign g e n e s into
host cells. Meanwhile other researchers are busy looking for
other antigen sites o n the A i d s virus - sites that will elicit the
production of antibodies.
It i s c l e a r , however, that any Aids vaccine is s o m e years away.
In thet short term the quest is for a drug that will cure Aids
victims, rather than a vaccine that will prevent the d i s e a s e
taking hold. A drug d e v e l o p e d by the W e l l c o m e Laboratories,
azidothymidine, is showing promise in early trials. After using
the drug for six w e e k s , 15 out of 19 patients s h o w e d increases
in the nuber of T-lymphocyte cells in their blood. Five other
drugs are in the first stages of human testing, but anti-viral
drugs in A i d s therapy must b e able to c r o s s the blood-brain
barrier, a n d s o far only azidothymidine s e e m s able to d o this
and them only in s o m e patients.
T h e best treatment at present is a drug to attack the virus,
c o m b i n e d with antibiotics, and interferon to try to repair the
immune system. But the most that c a n b e done at present is
prolong the victims.
T h e anti-viral drugs are d e s i g n e d to attack reverse
transcriptase, the viral e n z y m e described above that is
essential to the virus's deadly function. R e s e a r c h e r s in the U S
have s u c c e d e d in determining the amino acid s e q u e n c e of the
e n z y m e : this should m a k e it possible to design a better
anti-enzyme drug.
A completely different concept of A i d s recovery is to remove
the bone marrow of patients a n d repalce it with healthy marrow
from their identiacl twins: this has been attempted with three
male patients, but the results are not yet available.
Aids: Governments React
Government's all over the world are waking u p to the dangers,
real and imagined, of Aids. In Britain, the deapartment of health
has put full-page advertisemants in the national press, advising
of the dangers of rectal intercourse and using dirty needles for
injections. In California a law has b e e n proposed that would
allow compulsory Aids c h e c k s w h e n there is a 'compelling
public health need'.
T h e U S government p r o p o s e s to close its borders to anyone
with A i d s which will join leprosy, T B and syphilis on the list of
d a n g e r o u s contagious d i s e a s e s .
S a u d i A r a b i a has b a n n e d imports of b b o d , in a n attempt to
stem the spread of Aids. S a u d i Arabian citizens are being
offered new incentives to donate blood s o that the country c a n
b e c o m e self-sufficient. Kuwait has set u p the Middle East's first
Aids research centre following a conference o n the d i s e a s e
held there in M a r c h .
In Britain, the blood transfusion service now c h e c k s routinely
for A i d s virus, hepatitis B and syphilis.
Meanwhile, the. popularity of 'dips' at Hollywood parties h a s
declined enormously.
Aids: Name The Virus
A lot of controversy over A i d s centres o n the n a m e used for its
virus. T w o of the main protagonists in A i d s research are
embroiled in a bitter row over the name, and a committee,
chaired by Professor Harold V a r m u s , has b e e n deliberating o n
the subject for more than a year.
T h e evidence that the Aids-causing agent is a virus c a m e from
Dr L u c Montagnier at the Institut Pasteur, Paris. H e produced
an electron micrograph showing virus-like particles which he
calls lymphadenopathy associted virus (LAV).
S o o n afterwards D r Robert Gallo at the U S National Institutes
of Health s h o w e d that virus-like particles isolated from A i d s
patients were able to infect lymphocytes in culture. G a l l o calls
his virus human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-III). Further
research has since s h o w n these two virsues to b e essentially
the s a m e .
Last year techniques for the d i a g n o s e s of Aids were developed
seperately by the two groups. T h e Pasteur Institute has filed a
law suit against the U S group, which has patented the
discovery, o n the grounds that the U S technique w a s
d e v e l o p e d using material supplied by Montagnier
Matters were m a d e even w o r s e w h e n it w a s discovered that
Gallo had inadvertently used a n electron micrograph of the
French virus in his first paper on the subject.
T h e c o m p r o m i s e n a m e used s o far has b e e n HTLV-III/LAV, but
the V a r m u s committee has tentatively suggested human
immunodeficiency virus a s the new n a m e .
Gallo has said that he will not g o along with HIV; he w a s
incensed w h e n Montagnier used the term at a lecture before it
had appeared in a learned journal, against V a r m u s ' s strict
instructions.
T h e argument over the n a m e s e e m s somewhat trivial, a n d
almost childish. It is worrying, though, that two of the leading
research t e a m s in the subject should appear to b e at
loggerheads.
*Two new A i d s viruses have recently b e e n discovered, o n e by
the Paris group a n d another by the U S group. T h e n a m e s
given to them are L A V - / / a n d HTLV-IVrespectively. L 4 V - / / h a s
s o far only been found in two S e n e g a l men. HTLV-IV s e e m s to
be related to the A i d s virus, without actually causing Aids
s y m p t o m s .
