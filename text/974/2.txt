Education Changes Crash!
BY ANDREW TSENG
The Secretary of State for
Education, John Patten, has
confirmed his commitment to
introducing voluntary membership.
Addressing the Tory Party
Conference in Blackpool this week,
M r Patten said: "Last year, I
promised this conference that I
would end the one remaining closed
shop in this country - that of student
unions. We said we would do it.
And we will do it, very shortly, in
three ways: by the introduction of
the voluntary principle as the basis
of student union membership,
through tough new Codes of
Practice to prevent victimisation
and by putting an end to the scandal
of taxpayers' money being used to
fund political campaigns."
He also brings attention to the
possible change i n student
population i n a few years time:
"Over the next three years, a quarter
of a million extra students will be
given the chance to study and train
at one of our 500 excellent further
education colleges, extending
opportunities and meeting people's
aspirations in a way not see since
we began the sale of council
houses."
The Department For Education
is currently going through a period
of consultation regarding voluntary
membership before the publication
of a bill. The consultation period is
set to end at the end of this month.
Mr Patten has also launched an
investigation which is to consider
the introduction of a Super A
A-level grade. A spokesman for the
Department For Education
said,:"This is just something that
the Secretary of State has asked for
as an idea to be looked at...the top
upper rank of the A-level is to be
looked at. It is for those pupils of
particularly high abilities." The
inquiry has been prompted after
concern at the number of students
achieving very high grades at
A-level. This has caused some to
accuse the Government of letting
the A- level standard drop.
The investigation has caught
some university admissions tutors
unawares. David Atkins, the
Assistant Registrar at Imperial
College, said: "I have had no
chance to consider it...and until the
admissions policy committee meet
in November I will not be able to
make any comment."

Imperial College Union's fleet of
minibuses has been depleted after
one was written off over the
summer vacation.
Some members of the Youth
Hostel Association, one of Imperial
College Union's Recreational
Clubs, were on a tour to the Alps.
However, near Dartmouth, the van
span and rolled down a major road.
No other vehicles were involved in
the accident.
Apparently, the only part of the
minibus left undamaged was the
footplate at the back.
Four of the occupants were
taken to nearby hospitals but were
later discharged.
