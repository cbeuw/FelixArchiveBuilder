Hall Disturbances Swiped Cards
Two separate incidents on Monday
have sent some halls of residence
reeling in shock.
At Evelyn Gardens, a gentleman
purporting to be a Turkish ex-
resident was caught attempting to
gain entry into one college hall.
Security were called to the scene,
and the gentleman was restrained
by security and the warden. Shortly
afterwards, the man was arrested
and taken to Kensington Police
Speckled
The mystery of why white speckles
appear on chocolate bars could soon
be solved.
Julia Kinderlerer, a food micro-
biologist at Sheffield-Hallam
University has been awarded a
Â£35,000 government grant to
investigate the problem which costs
manufacturers millions of pounds.
Most manufacturers believe the
speckles are nothing more sinister
than crystallised cocoa-butter fat.
But Mrs Kinderlerer thinks the
Station. Upon later investigation it
was found that the man was in fact
African and not Turkish as he had
claimed. He has been released on
bail pending further inquires.
The other incident concerned
serious disturbances in Garden Hall.
These continued into the evening
with violent behaviour in the Union
Building. The person allegedly
responsible is the subject of police
inquires and college discipline.
Chocolate
speckling is caused by a fungus,
chrysoporium farinicola, which
reaches cocoa beans from the soil
and survives roasting, manu-
facturing and packaging. She said it
is an odd fungus which can grow in
dry conditions in food with a high
sugar content. Her study involves
buying chocolate at random, letting
it grow mouldy under controlled
conditions and isolating the
different types of mould that
develop.

The new combined security and
Imperial College Union Card has
been introduced. It is being phased
in through undergraduate and
postgraduate first years. Longer
standing students of Imperial
College w i l l continue to have
separate cards.
The merging of the two cards
has not posed much of a problem to
security. Terry Briley, Deputy
Security Manager, said that "just a
slight change in layout" was
required and that there was
"otherwise no problems".
A different kind of card has also
caught the attention of security
during Freshers' Week. In the first
three days of term, at least half a
dozen credit cards and bank cards
have been reported stolen. Security
are warning staff and students to be
vigilant. With Imperial College's
very open policy with regard to
access, and the number of entrances
to the college, Imperial has been
seen as a 'target rich' environment
to pick-pockets. "You have to be
even more careful in the first few
weeks," said Mr Briley.
Mr Briley commented that, 'it
would assist security if people wore
[their security passes].'
In order to try and beat the
pick-pockets, security are asking
everyone to wear their security
passes around college.
