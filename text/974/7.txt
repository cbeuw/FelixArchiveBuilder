Some Fantastic Place
A jaunty number here from those boppy
Squeeze chappies; R&B tinged pop numbers are
their speciality. Unfortunately though, there's
nothing here with the originality or generally
groovy feel of past hits such as 'Cool For Cats'
Even the arrival of Paul Carrick on keyboards
and occasional vocals has done little to spice
things up. In fact the only track which he sings
on sounds like the insipid ' M i k e and the
Mechanics'. This is a rather disappointing
album. Only the title track has any guts. It
makes the listener (or at least this one) want to
say "once more with feeling, pleasel".
Depressing really, considering the talent in the
band. However if you like your elevator music
professional, lively and slightly infectious, this
is it. Playing now in a supermarket near you. (5)

Engine Alley
Infamy
The shame of being an up-and-coming Irish
band; all those references to the next U2. The
conjunction of the words 'wolf and 'cry' spring
to mind. That aside and despite their name,
Engine Alley's debut single is none too bad. It's
a bit grating where 'infamy' becomes 'in for
me' but there's a good build up of momentum,
even if the overall result is lacking in spark.
There's also surprising variation over the range
of the four track cd. The dance hall-waltz
instrumental 'Lame Dog Lament' and the V8
reciprocating power of 'Robin Hood' sit well
together. So who chose the single? Only Marion
would know.
