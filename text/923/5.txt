Have you ever taken a pleasant
photograph or sketched a thoughtful
picture? Have you ever written a
beautiful poem or a moving story?
If you haven't maybe you should.
And if you, do maybe we could
print it.
Teachers and students in the arts
have often claimed that their
counterparts in science are
uncultured, uncouth and generally
unable to appreciate fine literature
or fine art. This is, o f course,
nonsense; numerous writers have
been educated in the sciences
whereas few writers have submitted
scientific papers. In this respect, all
IC students should bear in mind that
they are quite capable of producing
materia] for Phoenix, the college art
magazine, i f only they had the
inclination to do so, the desire to
create something beautiful that
others may admire (I, for my part
loathe mediocrity and by trying to
be creative I attempt to defy it).
What one submits need not be
incredibly deep or depressing - that
makes for cold reading if taken in
large doses. O n the contrary, if
you've ever written some verses
which you or colleagues find
amusing then by all means send it
in to us. A s an example, here's an
excerpt from a Betjeman poem:
Gracious Lord, oh bomb the Germans, I will labour for Thy Kingdom,
Spare their women for Thy sake,
And if that is not too easy,
We will Pardon Thy mistake.
But gracious Lord, whate'er shall be
Don't let anybody bomb me.
Help our lads to win the war,
Send white feathers to the cowards,
Join the womens' Army Corp,
Then wash the steps around Thy throne
In the eternal Safety Zone.
Stab At Immortality
Keep our empire undismembered
Guide our forces by Thy hand,
Gallant blacks from far Jamaica,
Honduras and Togoland;
Protect them Lord in all their fights,
And even more protect the whites.
Think of what our nation stands for,
Books from Boots and country lanes,
Free speech, free passes, class distinction,
Democracy and proper drains.
Lord, put beneath Thy special care
One and eighty Cadogan square.
Y o u see, it's not that hard. G o on!
have a stab at the proverbial artistic
immortality.
M y thanks to all the people who
have sent in material and to whom
I've been too impolite (and a wee
bit too ill) to reply. I hope that
having their names in print will
answer for all pains. Finally, can
we have a few more poems that
aren't written in blank verse and a
few more short stories? I'm toying
with the idea of awarding about £25
to the best piece o f work, not bad
when you consider the odds o f
winning (I just need permission
from the powers that be).
