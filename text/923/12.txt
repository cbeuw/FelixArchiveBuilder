Opinion Felix 923 24 January 1992
The Labour Party have taken a
large blow in the last twelve years.
Despite the failure of socialist
economic policy (state control of the
means production, distribution and
exchange) in other countries, the
new model Labour Party is still
offering us nationalisation and
interventionalist policies.
Recession
The W o r l d is in recession.
Following the boom years of the
'80s. too much demand following
the '87 crash was causing inflation

of communicating desired interest
rate to the market. Raising taxes to
control demand was the '60s and

to re-surface (although to nowhere
near the catastrophic 27% of the last
L a b o u r G o v e r n m e n t ) . The
Government acted decisively to
bring inflation back down to
German levels through the only
effective mechanism - increasing
interest rates. Industry needed a
cure for inflation. But industry itself
was affected by the cure applied.
Many businesses moved to take
advantage of the expanding market
and b o r r o w e d heavily f o r '
investment in the late 1980s, and
were therefore hit by high interest
rates. L o w order books and cash
flow difficulties added to the pain,
and business failures had risen as a
result. Other businesses have had to
cut back sharply and none of this is
in the least bit welcome.
But we cannot pretend that it
could have been avoided. Credit
controls are unworkable in our open
financial markets. Reserve asset
Recession, however, does not mean
that British business is weak. The
1980s saw a dramatic
transformation d u r i n g w h i c h
productivity soared (outstripping
even Japan), and investment grew
faster than in any major
industrialised country outside
Japan. Corporation Tax was cut
from Labour's 52p to 33p in the
pound (and from 42% to 25% for
small companies).
N e a r l y two-thirds o f the
nationalised sector has been brought
into private ownership, helping the
disciplines and competitive instincts
of private enterprise to transform
the culture and performance of
many of our most important
companies. British Steel, for
example, is now ranked as one of
the most efficient steel producers in
the world, while it was once in the
Guinness Book of Records as the
number one loss maker!
A recent German study of best
performing companies in Europe
showed an extraordinary British
pre-eminence. O f the best 50
companies in Europe, no less than
27 were British, while the French
had 3, the Germans 4, and nobody
else had more than three. A n d this
success - this outstanding success -
was not restricted to one or two.
sectors or to services; according to
the research, 6 out of the 10 top
p e r f o r m i n g companies in
manufacturing and engineering are
British, 5 out of 10 in paper, print
and publishing, 4 out of 10 in
chemical and life sciences. 5 in
technology and communications, 2
in mining and metals and 7 in
property and construction - a fairly
impressive all round performance.
None of this has necessarily made
the recession easier to bear, but the
underlying strength of British
business shows that the industrial
policy pursued by this Government,
was the right one; and as a result,
foreign businesses are continuing to
invest far more in Britain than in
any other E C country. In recent
years, Britain has managed to
attract more than 40% of all inward
investment flows in the E C - nearly
three times more than France and
six times more than Germany. W e
now export more per head of
population than either the U S A or
Japan.
By comparison, under Labour we
were known as 'the sick man of
Europe", and notorious examples of
inefficient companies, propped up
with subsidy, were laughed about
at home and abroad.
Recovery
Britain is ahead of the world
economic cycle. The economy is
back on track, and the recession has
bottomed out. W e are in a strong
position to take advantage of
eonomic upturn. That is greeted as
good news by everyone except
Labour. A s we approach an
election, the stock markets react
nervously but in general have
gained strength when opinion polls
show a Tory lead.
