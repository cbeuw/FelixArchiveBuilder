Felix Felix 923 24 January 1992
The courtroom was a grand
affair. It was a hundred foot long
and forty foot wide area that rose
up to rich paintings on the ceiling.
A row of pillars guarded the west
wall while windows hung on the
south wall at regular intervals,
beaming above decorated vases.
The crowd cheered wildly as a
resplendent, raven-haired, muscular
man in black shining armour
entered through the vast double
doors, sending bolts of lightning
shooting across the room to
vaporise walls, vases and one of the
guards. Still quietly sizzling after
The Inner System
Chapter 11,
Adjudication.
Troy Tempest
takes Stress to
Court
^THE? -TRUE
Poked out from the east wall was
a large gallery embellished with a
rabid audience. In the centre of the
room reposed two tall podiums and
a pit lined with spikes. The only
way into the rom was in the north
wall, a pillared entrance etched with
runaway decorations.
The only thing going on in the
room was the crowd in the gallery
spitting at Stress as he sat in the
bottom of the pit. Given time the
crowd would probably have
drowned him but their hosing was
cut short by a spirited fanfare. After
pounding out their notes the horns
stopped and into the room walked
a sharply dressed man.
Seeing the host the crowd cheered
hysterically and waved themselves
in the air as though being hit by a
violent storm. Soaking up the
applause he strode to the centre of
the room and placed himself beside
the pit. Silencing the audience with
a flick of his eyes he whipped a
microphone from his jacket and
addressed them.
'Hello everyone!'
H E L L O S T A K E ! '
'Yes it's me. Stake Picket
with...?'
He stood like a conductor and
waved his arms as the crowd
shouted out.
H O P E H E H A N G S H I M
HIGH!'
'Yes sirree, the weekly trial
where an almost convicted criminal
has the chance to be condemned to
death.'
He smiled down at the rattling
Stress.
'And without further ado let me
introduce the superheroes who will
be judging this case. For the
prosecution!'
He swung his outstretched arm
towards the entrance.
'The Dark Destroyer!'
his entrance routine he stepped onto
his podium.
'And for the defence!'
Stake gestured to the other
podium.
'Regenerator!'
A great crowded cloud of smoke
billowed up on the defence podium.
As the smoke cleared the audience
could see a man dressed all in green
with a panther kneeling at his side.
He pointed his hand at a vase in the
nearby wall. There was a green
flash and the vase, having recently
become a frog, hopped out the
window.
Stake turned to the audience.
Tn this week's trial Stress Factor
is accused of being a pale one here
to spy on the Inner System!'
He stabbingly pointed at Stress.
'Our two super heroes will help
you, the audience, decide whether
he's guilty or innocent. So take it
away guys!'
Stake Picket swept out to
concerted applause.
'Right!'
The Dark Destroyer stared
jaggedly across at his opposite
number. Thin blue coronas danced
around his eyes and a voice
emerged from his mouth, crackling
sparks.
'Heads or tails?'
Regenerator fixed him with a
volcanic gaze.
Tails!'
The human thundercloud pulled
out a coin. Placing it on his eighty
kilowatt thumb he flicked the coin
in a soaring arc across the room.
The coin hit the ground, bounced,
spun, rolled, tottered and turned,
into a fly. Quickly getting the hang
of its existence it flew away.
The prosecution looked at the
defence as though it was a lightning
conductor.
'It's no good turning the coin into
a fly, Reg. It was heads so I go
first!'
Regenerator glowered for a
second before grumbling assent.
Turning to the gallery the Dark
Destroyer roared in a voice of
bitumen and flint.
'Bring on the first witness!'
