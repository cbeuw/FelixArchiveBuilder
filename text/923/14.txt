Opinion Felix 923 24 January 1992
The idea that
the State knows
best and can
'pick winners'
worthy of
investment is
unrealistic.
Science in Britain
British academic research is
astoundingly successful. W e have
won more Nobel Prizes in science
than any other country except the
U S A - three times as many as
France and fourteen times as many
as Japan. The challenges are to feed
that achievement through into
commercial development. W e all
seem to share the same aims. O f
course the Government can help
fund R & D where the commercial

benefits may be too long term or
insecure to attract the necessary
money from private backers- pure
or 'pre-competitive' research as it
is called. The Government spends
some £ 3 billion a year on civil
research and development. That is
a higher proportion of national
i n c o m e than the Japanese
Government spends.
There are D T I research agencies
(eg the N a t i o n a l P h y s i c a l
Laboratory) and a number of
important programmes, such as
grants for developing new products,
or technology transfer campaigns.
The most successful economies,
eg. Japan and Germany, are not the
ones where Government spending
on R & D is particularly high. W e
must guard against the notion that
Government can make Britain
competitive, and here Britain's poor
record from out past 'corporatist'
days is improving steadily. What is
needed is a cultural revolution,
transforming the educational and
social bias against practical skills.
And good, healthy profits (not over
taxed), so that business have the
money to invest.
The idea that the state knows
best, and can 'pick winners' worthy
o f investment (at the tax-payer's
expense) is unrealistic. T h e
Conservative party has too close a
contact with the real world o f
business to go for unrealistic and
d a m a g i n g attempts at
interventionalism. The thought of
Labour's shadow cabinet deciding
how businesses should be managed,
when not one of them has personal
business experience, is frankly
laughable. O r worrying.
'1 i ail ling
It is vital that the Government
works closely with business, rather
than throwing programmes at them.
We do not agree with Labour's
policy o f forcing companies, using
their Jobs Tax as a whip. The
Conservatives do not agree with
Labour's bureaucratic nightmare of
councils and commissions and
quangos and regulations - all o f
w h i c h require something o f
business, sapping their sources.
Instead, the Tories are giving
businesses themselves more power
to control resources available to
them at local level, through
Training and Enterprise Councils,
regional D T I business service
centres, and partnership with the
Chambers of Commerce to deliver
a number o f export and other
services. Many companies seized
on the range of overseas trade
services for British businesses,
including the provision o f export
intelligence, counselling, sponsored
missions and export credit.
Environmental Protection
Similarly for the environment,
the Government must look to assist,
and encourage measures to clean up
industrial processes. Environmental
protection legislation is being
introduced at a steady rate, backed
up by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Pollution, and new bodies with real
teeth such as the National Rivers
Authority. The Tories have given
Britain Europe's first system o f
integrated pollution control. The
Green Party, by comparison view
economic growth as a futile goal.
Also Labour's commitment to
stabilise C O , output at present
levels by the year 2000 is totally
incompatible with their stated aim
of replacing Nuclear Power with
increased reliance on coal.
The Future Labour's burdens on
business would include a cobweb of
red tape; a cumbersome training
bureaucracy and a costly and
inflationary minimum wage which
would drive many more companies
to the wall.
Interest rates must fall as quickly
as is prudently possible. At a time
of squeezed profitability tax rates
must be especially l o w . and
inflation must be beaten.
M o r e than anything else, firms
want the opportunity o f free
markets and open competition and
a climate which respects and values
enterprise. T h e Conservative
strategy is to create a political
environment that leaves firms free
to get on with what they do best -
encouraged and unimpeded. Y o u
have a choice - if you agree, your
vote could be crucial, please use it.
