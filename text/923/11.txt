Little Man Tate
Little Man Tate is Jodie Foster's (or
should that be the Oscar-Winning-
Actress-Jodie-Foster's) directorial
debut, the modern-day fairy tale of
a stupendously gifted child (what
else?) prodigy.
Fred Tate (Adam Hann-Byrd)
could read at one. write poetry at
four, and now he's wont to vent
deep profundities about van Gogh.
He plays the piano brilliantly, he
evaluates fluid dynamics in his head
(well, nearly), and all the rest, but
- and here's the sting - he doesn't
have any friends. After a succession
of increasingly miserable
experiences in the working-class
neighbourhood where he Hves, a
small ray of hope arrives in the
form of Jane Grierson, a child
psychologist of some repute, who
wants to take Fred away and teach
him about Sunflowers. Foster plays
Dede, Fred's mother, a great but
restricted mother; she has her own
very definite ideas on how Fred
should be brought up. Jane takes
Fred off to a brain farm, where he
gets a chance to exercise his skills
more 'usefully', an arrangement
Dede is not happy with. Thus the
seeds of conflict and tension are
sown, ready to explode into full-
scale dramatic upheaval.
While you could safely say that
not very much happens in this film,
that's not necessarily a bad thing.
The story unfolds gradually,
concentrating on F r e d ' s
elationships with his mother ano
lane, clearly a topic with strong
autobiographical resonances for
Foster, herself presumably subject
lo conflicting influences in her time
as a child star. A s a directorial
debut it's a relaxed slide into the
job. competent but hardly on the
cutting edge. Someone else easing
gradually into a new role is Harry
Connick Jr.. who makes a short
appearance as a smooth young
(hey!) musician. Not exactly
stretching his ability, but he does it
adequately. Adam Hann-Byrd is
good as Fred, thankfully having
more acting ability than cute
muppetness (stand up. Macaulay
Culkin) and Foster herself puts her
usual understated skill into her
performance.
Sooo...L/ff/e Man Tate has
enough going for it to hold the
attention quite firmly for the
requisite amount of time, but it's not
going to w i n any awards. Never
mind, it's quite enjoyable anyway.
You certainly won't be wasting
your time (cf. Don't Tell H e r It's
Me).
The Oldest Child Prodigy
Gerbil In The World
Don't Tell Her It's Me
If I met this film in the street I
wouldn't give it the time of day. In
fact. I'd probably cross the road to
avoid it. A n d so should you.
Since that's not going to fill four
hundred words, I'd better say a little
more. Gus (Steve Guttenberg) has
just recovered from a serious illness
and wants to get some action. The
problem is that he's, like, a rilly
rilly sweet guy, y ' k n o w , but
y'know, he's bald an' all, and he
doesn't know too much about girls..
Fortunately, his sister L i z z i e
(Shelley Long) is a successful
romance novelist and knows
everything there is to know on the
subject; but when she introduces
Gus to Emily, a journalist o f her
acquaintance , things don't go well,
either for Gus or for the audience.
So together the siblings concoct a
patently ludicrous alter ego, a biker
named (snigger) Lobo, who hails
from New Zealand, to win Emily's
heart.
There ensues much 'George A n d
Mildred' style farce and mistaken
identity hijinks, only without the
vicar and substantially less flowing
with humour. Emily and Gus run
into each other around town at
inopportune moments, involving a
number of painfully unfunny scenes
and about the same number of
implausibilities so vast that even
Guttenberg cannot bridge them for
all his comic talent. I ' m not going
to give any details. Y o u don't need
them. Trust me.
At the end o f it all, Gus is found
out (no surprise there, then), Emily
decides she loves him anyway, after
a few token w o r d s about
manipulation and everything draws
to an unrealistic and unsatisfying
close.
Don'f Tell Her It's Me has a
terrible plot, doesn't seem able to
differentiate between a wacky
c o m e d y - o f - e r r o r s a n d Dying
Young, is about as entertaining as
watching a dead sheep bloat and is
the kind o f film that makes you
creep around in the dead o f night
with the horrible sensation that you
have completely wasted two hours
of your life.
I didn't like it.
