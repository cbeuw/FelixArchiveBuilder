coolest boy in school.
It's the end of a long, hot summer
for Sandy and D a n n y , two
American teenagers living in small
town America in 1959. Sandy, a
very attractive but naive girl, has
just moved to the town with her
family. At the beach one day, she
meets Danny - black leather, dark
glasses, handsome and charming -
everything she ever dreamed of!
They spend the rest of the summer
hanging out together on the beach
- sun. sea. surf - the ideal setting
for a love story!
The summer ends however, and
they have to go back to school.
There. Sandy gets in with the Pink
Ladies: Rizzo, Marty; Frenchie and
Jan. With the help of Danny's
Burger Palace Boys: Kenicke,
Roger, Doody and Sonny, the Pink
Ladies set up a date for Sandy and
Danny. Afterwards. Sandy learns
from Patty, another one of Danny's
girls, that he is actually a bit of a
rogue and not at all the charmer he
was on the beach.
It was love at first sight for
Danny. Sandy has stolen his heart
and he is desperate to woo her.
Sandy, too, is in love with Danny,
but she thinks she's just going to be
another one of his girls.
W i l l Sandy and Danny find each
other in time for the Autumn Hop?
W i l l the music be loud and live?
W i l l you sing Grease Lightning?
How will you find out if you don't
come and see Grease?
