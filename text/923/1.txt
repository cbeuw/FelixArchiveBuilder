Tale of a Dead Piano
M r Steve Farrant will not be facing
any disciplinary charges after he
was banned from the U n i o n
Building on Saturday 18th January
lor authorising the destruction of an
unused piano.
M r Farrant claims he found a
group of people 'hitting' the piano
and said they could 'take a
sledgehammer as far as I am
concerned." though he added that
this was a 'throwaway comment'
and that he was drunk at the time.
Ms Gina Mortley, duty officer on
the night, said that she felt M r
Farrant should leave the building,
and after discussing the matter with
him. she finally banned him from
the building for 24 hours.
According to the duty officer, M r
Farrant tried to re-enter the building
later. The duty officers claimed that
a dispute evolved during which the
drunk M r Farrant told them that
they would not be re-employed as
duty officers and that the incident
would adversely affect the chances
of election of one o f them in the
approaching sabbatical elections.
M s Z o e H e l l i n g e r . U n i o n
President, spoke to College student
media on Tuesday defending M r
Farrant's position. M s Hellinger
said the affair was not conduct that
would lead to a disciplinary
committee' but it was more serious
than if a student had done it.
M s Hellinger continued that M r
Farrant would not be able to carry
out any o f the threats he is said to
have made. She also commented
that duty officers should not discuss
events which occured during duty
as confidentiality was part of their
contract.
M r Farrant told Felix that he
could not remember what happened
but that he was 'very drunk' and
had apologised to the people
concerned. He said that he did not
want to resign but that being
Honorary Secretary 'was not the job
I stood for.'
A meeting o f the U n i o n
Executive called to consider the
issue yesterday resolved that M r
Farrant was 'out of order' and he
had 'no power' to carry out any
threats he had made. The executive
also said that, in their view, the 24
hour ban was sufficient punishment
as no other misconduct had
occurred.
Sorry Goo'd-
All Bye
Felix is smaller than usual this
week, and o f variable printing
quality, due to a series o f
production problems. This includes
one member o f staff being i l l , the
other being on holiday and the
replacement printer trying to find
somewhere to live. A conspiracy of
machinery failure has led to the near
breakdown o f the editor. Many
apologies - you've got to laugh
haven't you.
M r Ramesh Patel. assistant union
bur manager, has resigned after

The Union will be advertising the
job to outside applicants and M r
Patel's resignation will take effect

Library Fines
The College Library are starting to
enforce fines on all overdue books
and recordings. The fines will be 25
pence a day on books and 10 pence
a week for recordings. A l l restricted
loans will be charged at 20 pence
an hour, and overnight loans at 25
pence per day overdue. A n
additional charge of Â£1 will be made
on extremely overdue items.
Anyone with overdue books or
unpaid fines will not be allowed to
remove items from the libraries.
M r Richard H a l l s . Reader
Service Librarian, said that fines
have been in regulations since 1989
and students using the library had
been informed o f them. M r Halls
added that the regulations were now
being enforced due to the fact that
over a thousand books were now
overdue and that this is the only way
books that were several months
overdue would be returned.
Zoe Hellinger. Union President,
said that she was 'quite shocked' at
the level o f the fines but that the
Library had every right to expect
that library books were returned on
time. M s Hellinger hoped that the
Library would be 'lenient' with less
well-off students.
