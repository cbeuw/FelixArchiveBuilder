Literalism?
Dear Adam,
Hooray! Croatia is now
recognised as a soverign,
independent territory. No more
shelling of places like Vukovar,
Gospich and the holiday resort of
Dubrovnik. No more Croats
starving and no more of them
massacred by the Serb- dominated
Federal Army. It's a great step
forward for democracy.
But it isn't. The Western Media
has hoodwinked the people of
Britain by biassed reporting, i.e.
from the Croatian side. The Press
never mentioned the 200,000
Serbiann refugees who have fled
from Croatia into neighbouring
Serbia and Bosnia, for fear of
persecution, thereby losing their
land and possessions. What about
the Serbs who have been killed
inthe most vile ways by Croatian
Neo-Fascists? After all, this present
conflict can be seen to have begun
in the Spring of 1991 when a band
of Croats decided to murder some
Serbs, like the 'good old days,' in
an area near Plitvitce National Park,
Eastern Croatia. They sang Ustasa
songs, a hark back to the Fascist
days of Croatian history when
hundreds of thousands of Serbs
were massacred. Indeed, without
consulting the rest of the Yugoslav
Federation, Croatia declared its
independence overnight and now is
taking away more land than that
with which it had when it joined
Yugoslavia in 1918.
Let me get things straight. This
civil war is not just about the
secession of Croatia (it has a perfect
legal right to do so, but only in
accordance with the laws of
Yugoslavia) but about the protection
of Serbian minority in Croatia.
With the help of Italy, Austria and
Germany, a Fascist state of Croatia
was formed in 1941, led by a blood-
thirsty man called Pavelich.
Immediately, he began to massacre
Serbs (and Jews and Gypsies)
wholesale, even extracting their
eyes as trophies, and for this he got
recognition of his Catholic State by
the Vatican.
After the War, these crimes were
covered up by Tito, a Croat
himself, and to debilitate the Serbs
even more, he took away parts of
their land and gave it to Croatia,
e.g. Slavonia. This is why there is
now approximately 600,000 Serbs
living in the Eastern lands of
Croatia.
If they get massacred again,
whose fault will it be? Surely the
E.C.'s for recognising an illegally
independent country.

Roll Over
Dear Adam,
Having read the notice in the
Union Snack-Bar, explaining that
we are not allowed to eat packed
lunches in there between 12 and
2pm, I feel compelled to write and
complain.
Of course, I understand that
people who buy food in the snack-
bar should be entitled to a seat, but
it's not exactly as if the place has
been over-run with picnickers
complete with thermos flasks and
tartan rugs.
This is typical of the Union -
instead of addressing the more
fundamental issues such as welfare
or housing, the sabbaticals seem to
spend their time hiding in their
offices or devising schemes such
that anyone who cannot afford to
buy food from the snack-bar is
banished to the lounge to eat a
solitary lunch.
Anyway, I'd like to see how the
Union will enforce this rule; I can't
imagine a 16 stone, 6 foot rugby
player meekly retiring to the Ents.
Lounge on the command of an
ineffectual sabbatical.
Please do not print my name, as
I do not want to be confused with
those pathetic individuals who start
bombarding Felix with letters at this
time of year as an early sabbatical
election campaign.
Name withheld by request.
P.S. Before I get any indignant
replies from the current sabs,
remember dearies - you only have
half of the year left to start doing
something about your unfulfilled
manifesto promises from last year.
Dear Adam,
In Felix on the 10th January you
published a letter from Mr/Miss
L . G . Maskall entitled 'Mindless
Waffle', in which Christians are
accused of writing 'narrow minded'
articles.
Christianity is not based upon the
creation story presented in the book
of Genesis, nor on the belief that
God hands out petty punishment for
forgetting to say one's prayers. As
the writer of the afore mentioned
letter is him/herself unable to accept
any grounds for the importance or
relevance of the Genesis story, I
would hope that (s)he, and others
of similar mind might realise and
respect the broad mindedness of
someone who is able to. regardless
of the 'evedence' against. Indeed,
one has to have a broad mind to
accept much of the Bible.
I find it interesting to read that
'when one looks at the world
around us. it's obvious He's a total
bloody sadist". Sadism is (sadly) a
human quality, and a closer look at
the world clearly shows that all too
aften it is the work of mankind that
is to blame for suffering.
Yours sincerely.

Scepticism
Dear Editor,
Elephants and Ice-Cream. How
do you make a dead elephant float?
One scoop of ice-cream and one
dead elephant.
Old joke, yes we know, but isn't
that what IC is all about? I mean I
could name a few old jokes around
here. Take Eric Ash for example.
Due for felling if you ask me. I
mean 18 months left, just enough
time to create a new old grey
elephant to take his place. White
elephants for that matter are slightly
different, I mean, look at the Union
office, a complete shambles, that's
what white elephants are all about.
Now Zoe, there's an elephant if
ever I've seen one, or rather a
moose, isn't it about 6 Vi weeks. Or
was that the film all about sex by
David Attenborough. (All that grass
goes to your head, gween, gween
gwass). Talking of people with
beards, what is going on the
Residences Office, all this talk of
T . V . but which one is it? And,
when are they going to show the
repeats. I mean such a classic move
of the check mating on Clayponds
with the bishop or was it the
Rector?
Any how, what's this we hear
about M S F strikes, 3am Eternal
was rather a good track if you ask
me even if that Poddy gezzer
doesn't think so. Mind you does he
like anything? Ice cream perhaps
(well we had to get it in somewhere
didn't we and all the other holes
were filled up). I prefer frozen
yoghurt personally, especially when
dipped in small flightless chocolate
birds. Talking of which, why does
he have to stand for his own job?
He's a lazy arse and I think he'd
much rather sit down, after all he
looks as though he needs the sleep.
He's got more bags than
Sainsbury's, but then again they
never have enough and they always
fall apart when the lift is out of
order due to fire bombs. Yes a little
out o f order, that last statement,
must have been forged by the
police, another really groovy band.
1 mean have you seen their trousers?
This is complete dross but it will fill
the music page it normally does.
Talking of music, why doesn't
the Ents disco play any. And as for
Michael Jackson re-releasing his
black and white single with new
added base line, what would he
know, he can't even decide what
colour he wants to be. Fact: if
you're black, crippled and
homosexual you are more likely to
get a job on graduating than anyone
else, however if you are small,
Chinese and exceedingly rich you
are more likely to get a place at
college to start with. That was not
a racist comment, but...
Typical IC student I hear you cry,
but at least I overcame my apathy
and bothered to write something for
Felix which is more than we can say
for you guys out there (not sexist,
cause the minority don't count).
Name held by request using the
right hand only.
Any explanation of this letter
would be most appreciated -
Adam.
