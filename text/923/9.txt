24 January 1992 Felix 923 Feature
Grease is the biggest musical
project to hit Imperial College for
many, many years. It is the product
of over six months of planning,
production and rehearsal by a small
team of members and ex-members
of IC DramSoc and OpSoc. The
idea of staging Grease came to the
producers, Richard Harrison and
Derek Hirst, last summer whilst in
a drunken stupor in the Union Bar
and not through any personal
admiration for Olivia Newton-John
(or John Travolta).
Although both DramSoc and
OpSoc have never produced a
project on this scale before, limiting
themselves to small-scale College
productions and touring every
summer to the Edinburgh Fringe
Festival, the idea soon became a
firm proposal. By early last term,
the project received firm financial
backing from I C U , the three C C U s
and the Rector of the College.
Many people accuse Imperial
students of a lack of creativity and
a general apathy towards the Arts,
but the directors, Philip Hollman
and Joanna Tripp, were astonished
by the response to the
advertisements for auditions and the
enthusiasm for performing shown
by the people that turned up. The
auditions took place in mid-October
for a chance to perform in one of
more than the forty places on offer.
The directors eventually decided
that the roles of Sandy, the lead
female, and Rizzo were both to be
filled by students from the Royal
College of Music, but almost all of
the rest of the cast (including the
cast was not the only difficulty
faced in this production. The
production crew faced the prospect
of building a theatre within the
Great Hall, which has a stage that
'is wider than most West End
theatres. Not only that, if you've
noticed any bedrooms being moved
The making of 'Grease'
lead male, Danny) consist of
Imperial students. What talent
would have lain undiscovered if it
were not for Grease?
Since November, every Monday,
Tuesday and Sunday have seen over
fifty cast and production crew
assemble in the rehearsal studio to
piece together the complex dance
routines and music necessary to
make a musical on this scale work.
Combining forty singing voices,
dancing and a live band, proved to
.be "quite a task for the
choreographers, Virginia King and
Lyanna Iveson, but the hard work
and dedication needed to get the cast
to move in the right direction and
at the right time has paid off.
The direction of the forty-odd
into the Great Hall today, it's us -
we've got to transform a bare
orchestral venue into a theatre in
only three days.
So. you've read about it - now
come and see it! The production
runs from Tuesday 28th January to
Saturday 1st February at 7.30pm
every evening. Tickets are available
now but be quick because they are
selling very fast - buy one from the

The sweat,
blood and tears,
the pain and
passion in the
exhibition of the
soul
