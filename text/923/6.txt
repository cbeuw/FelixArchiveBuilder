Gliding over Hampshire P a k S o c
* ^ IC Pakistan Society is d i
It's freezing, blowing a gale and
threatening to rain. A n d to think I
could have been tucked up in bed
with a mince pie and a bottle of
whisky. I must be mad - or
dedicated because I was on the
Imperial College gliding club N e w
Year course, held at the Lasham
gliding centre in Hampshire. The
aim was to fly as much as possible
over the space o f 5 days, which is
the best way to begin when learning
to glide.
The weather cleared up for the
first few days, enabling us to fly.
After a breakfast of scrambled eggs
and gallons o f tea in the clubhouse,
the hanger doors were opened and
the sleek fibreglass gliders wheeled
out. IC gliding club owns three of
these machines, including the new
two seater in which we do most of
our training before graduating onto
'hot' single seaters.
Before the glider is flown it is
thoroughly checked to see if it is
airworthy, and that no mice have
made their new home (this has
happened before). W e then towed
the glider to the launch point,
donned parachutes, and ran through
pre-takeoff checks. Then launch,
either by winch or by taking a tow
from another aeroplane. After
releasing the towing cable the noise
level dies down and you admire the
spectacular view. It's now easy to
see w h y g l i d i n g is such a
compulsive sport. After practising
turns, spins and stalls it's time to
land.
In the summer, flights can be
extended by using thermal
upcurrents but winter is an ideal
time for training because the airfield
is not busy. The instructors who
flew in the back seat are all ex I C
students, and are suitably qualified
and have yet to crack under the
tension of teaching present day
students to fly.
In the evening much beer (and
Southern Comfort, eh Rob?) was
consumed at the New Year's party.
Other excursions d u r i n g the
evenings involved trips to the local
pub, which is usually full of glider
pilots unwinding (not a pretty
sight). Great fun was had by
chasing rabbits across the airfield on
the way back from the pub. Why do
they freeze in your headlights?
During the course we stayed in the
club's bunkhouse - a palatial
residence dating from W o r l d W a r
II, and with more furry friends for
company.
The weather got worse at the end
of the week, but not before we had
got a lot of flying done. Gliding is
a great way to meet people and to
have fun. Future plans include a trip
to Wales at Easter to go 'wave'
soaring, and an expedition to either
Gap or L e Blanc in France over the
summer on which new members are
welcome.
So why not join today and maybe
we'll see you there. If your appetite
has been whet and you want more
information, come along to a
gliding club meeting on Thursdays
at 1pm in Aero 266.

Canoe Polo Team Winning?
Following our storming defeat in
Warwick the I C Canoe Polo team
went to U L U on 11th December for
a U L Intercollegiate tournament. In
their first game the Slappers
paddled out to a standing ovation,
eager to play the Royal Vets. A n
unprecedented commotion ensued
from the off and with awesome skill
and impressive technique the Vets
demonstrated their total mastery o f
the sport in what turned out to be
an even contest - men in tune with
their canoes. We won 6-0.
Our second game was against
L S E . Another frenzied foray
whipped the pool into a mass of
foam as the teams duelled
unrelentingly. Despite all our
attempts we were forced to score a
fine goal just before the interval.
The second half was another close
battle; finally the crowd were
stunned into silence as L S E shot an
equaliser - rightly disallowed by the
referee (a fine upstanding man). In
the end we had to concede yet
another surprise victory, winning
1-0.
The o n l o o k i n g teams were
naturally stunned by the display o f
our teetotal team, who had already
begun their strict training schedule
for the January fixtures. Fortunately
this meant the losing teams could
drown their sorrows appropriately.

IC Pakistan Society is proud to
present a talk by Abdul Wajid this
evening (Friday, 24th January) at
5.30pm in the Concert Hall, entitled
'Asian: Born to be B r o w n ' . M r
Wajid will be discussing the
difficulties of identity crisis that face
many young Asians who are born
both in the Asian Sub-Continent and
in the U K . Is it a personality
problem when it is difficult to adapt
to the surroundings, especially
when massive cultural difference
exists?
Is there actually such a thing as
an Asian identity? After a l l , can
Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and
Muslims live together and strive to
solve their communal strife? M r
Wajid will be putting forward an
Islamic approach as the
comprehensive solution to these
problems. So i f you are interested
why not come along!
Green
Jonathon Porritt, an inspirational
leader o f the Green Movement and
former director of the Friends of the
Earth, will be discussing various
environmental issues this Tuesday
(28th).
Porritt was born in 1950 and is
the son and heir of Baron Porritt o f
Hamstead (the bronze medallist in
the 1924 O l y m p i c 1 0 0 m ,
representing New Zealand, behind
Britain's Harold Abrahams o f
'Chariots of Fire' fame). He was
educated at Eton and eventually
received an M A in M o d e r n
Languages at Magdelen College
Oxford. Between 1975-1984 he was
a school teacher and head of English
and Drama. During this time he was
co-chairperson for the British Green
Party which he represented as a
candidate in the 1979 and 1983
general elections.
A s director o f Friends o f the
Earth from 1984, Porritt has led the
pressure group to several successful
campaigns and into a new era, with
the groups membership increasing
ten-fold to over a quarter o f a
million members.
Since leaving Friends of the Earth
in 1990, Porritt has been a
consultant to J Sainsbury and has a
regular column in the 'Green
Magazine'. He also managed to
enter the 'International Who's W h o '
in 1991.
And so this Tuesday, Jonathon
Porritt will reach another career
milestone when he appears
exclusively in M e c h E n g at
12.45pm.
