Library Merge
The C o l l e g e ' s L y o n Playfair
Library may soon be merging with
the Science Museum library next
door to it. M r Richard Halls. Lyon
Playfair sub-librarian, said that the
proposals include knocking down
the dividing wall betwen the two
libraries.
Under the proposals the two
libraries would share each others
resources such as publications
which are presently held by both
libraries. There are no plans for
staff cuts, and each library would
keep its own personnel.
Initial designs for the new layout
of the b u i l d i n g include the
permanent closure of the College
library entrance facing the Queen's
Tower such that the only access
would be through the current
Museum Library entrance. There
will be one enquiry and book issue
desk near the new entrance, with
the Haldane Library moved to
occupy the rest of the ground floor.
The other floors will be used to
house an integrated collection of
Central and Science Museum
Library material.
The merged library will open at
10.00am and have shorter hours at
weekends. Zoe Hellinger, Union
President, said that she believed
many students will be unhappy with
the new times as the library will be
inaccessible for the first hour of the
day with restricted access at
weekends.
Subject to finalising legal
agreements, the proposals are due
to be implemented over the summer
vacation this year.

NHS Probing
Imperial's Management School has
been commissioned to review the
National Health Service ( N H S )
management structure. The survey
of senior N H S managers will last
two years and an interim report will
be issued this October with a final
report in December 1993.
The survey team will study senior
managerial competence, succession
planning and organisation
development, with particular
reference to alleged tensions
between managers and other
professionals.
The team leader. Professor
Sandra Dawson, commented that
'there is concern about the
dangerous gap between existing and
required managerial capability. The
project will measure that gap and
make recommendations for the
future.' £ 190.000 has been released
by the Department of Health to fund
the project.
