Everything but Boardsailing
Due to unavoidable circumstances,
for which the management takes no
responsibility, the boardsailing club
was unable to enjoy one of their
notorious weekends away from the
country's capital. BUT...drumrolls
please...skillful planning meant that
a back-up plan was q u i c k l y
implemented. Scheme B involved a
very early start, on a Sunday, of all
days...would it come off O K ?
(What suspense!)
Sunday morning dawned bright
and early. Zombies emerged and
loitered outside the windsurfing
shed. 8.30am came and went,
where was the fourth member of the
'famous four'? What could have
happened to him? Could he be lying
in a ditch somewhere (where are
there ditches in London?)? Could he
have been attacked by the dreaded
smog monster? O r could he.
simply, be at home, asleep in bed?
None the wiser about the
vnereabouts of Daniel, the club
aeparted. But this was not to be the
only mystery of the day. the next
one loomed on the horizon: how
would they get the petrol cap off?
It had been tried, but even the most
intelligent (or maybe that should be
the least intelligent) of them had not
succeeded. H o w long would their
meagre supply of petrol last? Would
they be forced to get out and push?
Or would luck be with them (for
those who don't believe in God)?
Only time would tell.
Arrivina at their lestination. near
Bedford, the intrepid explorers

were soon ready for action. They
went over the rocky terrain on
quads, pilots and go-karts,
managing to keep to the track
Basketball Champs
I C ' s men's basketball team
advanced to the second round o f the
U A U championship, sweeping all
before them at a regional
tournament on Saturday the 18th of
January, at Brunei University. The
pool event brought IC up against
Kings College, Reading and hosts
Brunei.
In the opening game Kings
College matched IC in scrappy first
half. However after the break.
Imperial limited the Kings offence
to just 5 points, while adding 26 to
their own total. Eight oflmperial's
nine players contributed to the
eventual 43-19 v i c t o r y , with
Angelos Kountouris leading scorer
with 11 points.
R e a d i n g p r o v i d e d tore
resistance, managing to stay v thin
two points well into the second ....
Not until the final 5 minutes die K
manage to o v e r c o m e their
opponents well organised man-to-
man defence, winning 43-33. Mike
Reeves (10 points) and Michalis
Senis (10) led IC with strong work
close to the basket.
Beating Brunei proved to be the
stiffest test. They led 26-22 by the
end of the first half, and looked to
be in control. But within a minute
of the restart Imperial had drawn
level. With two minutes to go IC led
by 6 points. Brunei tried to turn the
(except for yours truly) and
emerged, in mud. starving and
exhausted at the end of the morning.
There were no casualties.
Miraculously, Daniel, the missing
member of the F F using that
incredible Imperial initiative, had
showed his face and even completed
the trail.
After lunch the team were ready
to take in their stride whatever came
next. Jetskiing. jetbiking and
waterskiing lay in store. But soon,
the dreaded equipment wrecker
showed his face once more,
determined that he should not miss
a single one o f the c l u b ' s
expeditions. S w i f t l y . he
commandeered a jetski and then a
leibike. Not content with even this
conquest, he also put the second
jetski out of use. The spirits of
everyone remained high—they

iDoneni to attempt "foul shots',
tunately for Brunei their plan

free-throws. Imperial held on to win
bv 57-51. with the top scorers Matt
Haddon (14). Angelos Kountouris
(11) and Andy A n g (10).
IC next face East Anglia at Swiss
Cottage on Saturday 25th January.

FilmSoc: The Russia House
Continuing with the distinctive
Russian feel to these pages, the
Film Soc present The Russia House
this week, which stars Sean
Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer. The
film, directed by Fred Schepsis, is
based on a John le Carre novel and
is a stylish spy thriller set in
Moscow.
Connery is sent to Russia to make
contact with Pfeiffer, who is
passing information to British
Intelligence f r o m R u s s i a n

who submit material for Felix do so
after first preparing the piece using
a word processor (text editor), and
then print it out onto paper. In such
cases, it would be extremely helpful
if the material were submitted on a
dissidents. The British Intelligence
are concerned about a particularly
important defector, and so send
Connery to find out what is going
on under the pretence of being an
author at a book convention.
The film has a strong supporting
cast, including Ray Schneider,
James F o x and Klaus M a r i a
Brandauer, and the plot is both
exciting and unpredictable with a
fantastic twist at the end. The
camera-work is breath taking with

I don't mind what type of disk it is

is used to generate the tile (PC. Mac
etc) so long as it is in plain text

character is meant to be a fine jazz
player).
The Russia House will be shown
at 7.30pm on Thursday 30th
January, in Mech Eng 220. Entry

Nevertheless some individuals were
suffering dimensia from college
which induced them to go barefoot
waterskiing. in the dark? The boat
driver must have been minus some
brain cells, especially in contrast to
the genius who eventually got the
petrol cap undone.
Alter a day such as this, the F F
and the rest of the gang felt that
going into college the next day was
a bit dull. Many questions were
asked about the cause of the bruises
and stiffness. It was decided that,
so excitement should remain in tneir
lives, the trip should be repeated
again in the future.
The moral to this story is that you
were an apathetic idiot if you didn't
come with us.
