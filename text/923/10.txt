JFK—the story that won't go away
On November 22 1963 the United
States of America was to be forever
changed as a nation. T h e
assassination o f President John F .
Kennedy placed this country on a
path toward other events—which
would, in turn, shake the very
foundation of American society and
forever alter the way they look at
their government and at each other.
JFK chronicles J i m Garrison's
investigation into the
assassination—as district attorney of
New Orleans—and the prosecution
of New Orleans businessman Clay
Shaw for conspiracy in the murder.
The film also utilises public sources
and other information which has
surfaced in the past two decades.
The film is not simply Garrison's
story, Garrison is used, rather, as
a protagonist to enable Stone to
present the mountain of information
which he and his research staff
d i s c o v e r e d s u r r o u n d i n g the
Kennedy assassination.
Jim Garrison, as a prosecutor,
sought above all to know how, by
whom and why John F . Kennedy
was murdered. T o academy award
winner Oliver Stone, the question
was not who?—but, why? The
malaise, the unease, the
disillusionment, the cynicism.
Fuelled by one o f the strongest
casts any film has ever seen,
including Kevin Costner, Sissy
Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe
P e s c i , G a r y O l d m a n , Jack
L e m m o n , K e v i n Bacon, John
C a n d y (and many more
distinguished actors accounting for
about 40 academy award nominees
and twenty oscars). Oliver Stone
gives us what appears to be the most
up-to-date, throroughly researched
'documentary' o f the events
following the president's death. He
has produced a film that is bound
to shock many people, the film has
already had plenty of criticism
Stateside, I think, mainly because
the truths it tells are scarily realistic
and are truths, a l l the facts
presented are 100%.
JFK is a long film—over three
hours in fact, a lot o f this time is
spent presenting facts, albeit in a
dramatic way, this may seem
daunting but is unfortunately
necessary.
Technically the film is superb, as
one would expect considering the
talent involved, but it won't be to
everybody's taste, it's basically a
why-dunnit rather than a who-
dunnit, which shows how naive the
American people have been, and it
will undoubtedly cause some
unwanted and rather large ripples.
A moving, compelling and very
worrying film—not to be missed
even i f you hate it, you'll learn a
lot. Kevin Costner delivers another
award winning performance. (God
knows what he'll be doing for an
encore). It's raining oscars out there
and thfs film has the largest net with
the smallest holes.

Blame it
Dudley Moore has been absent
from the film scene for quite some
time—his last few forays being none
too memorable. So it comes to pass
that Dudley M o o r e makes a
welcome comeback, leading a
strong cast into this comic tale of
mistaken identity. Anyway, on with
the story...
Picture the scene, Venice in
on the
spring, now let us concentrate on
three English gentelmen booking
into the Hotel Gabrielli: M r Orton,
M r Horton and M r Lawton. N o w
if you know an Italian (my Dad) you
will realise this spells disaster, for
the harassed Italian bellboy
(Bronson Pinchot) it's worse, and
for the disparate souls with the
similar sounding names, it is no less
a catastrophe.
Melvyn Orton (Dudley Moore) is
the mild mannered clerk sent by his
bully of a boss to supervise the
purchase of a villa. Maurice Horton
(Richard Griffiths), a middle aged
lothario eager for the heady
Bellboy
romantic promise o f Medi-Date.
M r Lawton (Bryan Brown), in
reality M r Charlton Black, is a
professional hit man in Venice to
kill person or persons unknown.
While events conspire to confuse
everyone utterly, people other than
Orton, Horton and Lawton become
wittingly and unwittingly involved.
The Mafia boss Scarpa (Andreas
Katsmas) and his henchmen; the
beautiful and ambitious estate agent
Caroline (Patsy Kensit), love
hungry Patricia (Penelope Wilton)
and Maurice's wife Rosemary
(Alison Steadman).
The bellboy does his very best to
oblige the assembled company but
the result is a degree of confusion
seldom eclipsed.
Forget your Terminators and
your Robin Hoods, this is a film I
most strongly recommend, it had
me in tears, constantly on the edge
of my seat, this is a comedy unlike
any other. Seldom do you go to a
cinema and witness the clapping of
hands as I did here. I haven't given
much away—it would be unfair to.
A completely original story and
some hilariously convincing acting,
will make this one of the funniest
films o f the year—roll on good o f
British humour.
Poo.
