Tonight sees the timely return of
T H E C O M E D Y C L U B , featuring
some of the best in stand up comedy
currently doing the rounds on the
London circuit. M a i n acts are
L I T T L E D A V E and the
U N C O O R D I N A T E D J U G G L E R S
A S S O C I A T I O N . There's also the
gong show - a couple o f new
comedians trying out their acts, so
bring your rotting fruit. The whole
thing will be masterfully m c ' d by
P A U L R O G A N .
If you fancy a spot of stand-up, haul
ass to the U N I O N L O U N G E
of charge from Health Authority
Family Palnning Clinics. However,
until Spring 1992. the Health
Centre is giving away packets o f
condoms. Initialy, you will need to
see a doctor or nurse, but thereafter
packets can be obtained from the
Health Centre reception. The 'Free
Condom Scheme' will be used to
discover whether:
1. It is appropriate for general
practice health centres to distribute
condoms.
2. Doctors should be able to
prescribe condoms on the National
Health Service.
T o this end, questionnaires are
being distributed with the condoms.
The questionnaires are anonymous
and information cannot be traced to
the respondants. Please help the
Health Centre staff to collect data,
by completing and returning them.
So what do we have in the most
essential magic box this side of
Calais? In reverse order, in third
place, Ignorance, who I have never
heard of. Don't blame me if they're
shite, but RockSoc's illegible press
release says they are inspired by
Faith No More, and they are a
British funk metal band.
O n w a r d and u p w a r d , i t ' s
football. Y o u can't get away from
it. can you? Arsenal v. Liverpool
on the T V , and Mexico 70 and Pele
live. Don't fight it. Y e s , I know
Windsor's a long way away, but I
thought you might like to breathe
sometimes.
And My Life Story. Reviewed in
Felix 916, this quote is from Lise.
'..do it damn well.' I think she liked
it. I can never really tell. But it's
free for God's sake. What more can
1 do? A n d I do like 3am Eternal.

T h e . regular Ents club night,
L I B I D O continues unabated this
term, now with a regular midnight
bar extensions. Featuring dance,
indie and 70's, it's on Wednesdays,
it starts at 9.30pm and finishes at
lam. and it's F R E E .
A Jolly Good Fellow
The College often bestows
honorary honours on Grandees to
show h o w much they are
appreciated, to catch some o f the
reflected glory and, presumably, to
look good on the list of people who
have something to do with the
College. Amongst the list o f
Honorary Fellows is one Robert
Maxwell. Admittedly the College
didn't know he waj the greatest
crook since Ferdinand Marcos
when they 'fellowed' him, but it is
interesting to note that he was
considered to be on the same level
as some o f the best scientists the
planet has to offer.
Letters
The main purpose o f the letters
page is to allow individuals to
exercise their right to free speech.
The effect o f an opinion is limited
if those making it do not wish to be
known that they are making it.
Thus, although I do allow names to
be withheld on occasion, this only
occurs i f the letter's author
persuades me in person that they
would be in some danger from
retaliation if their authorship was
known. Mere embarrassment is not
enough - don't be a coward - stand
up for your views.
The deadline for letters is
Monday 12.30pm. five days before
the publication date. There is a
reason for this deadline - don't think
you can ignore it and still
necessarily get something in, as this
would require trashing somebody
else's article which had been
received in good time.
There are no music pages this
week due to a last minute
contraction o f Felix in the sudden
realisation that the whole lot had to
printed on one day. The music
editor. Poddy, is none too amused
by this and has threatened me with
a four page music bit next week as
compensation. It remains to be seen
whether the immutable laws o f
nature can be muted that far.
