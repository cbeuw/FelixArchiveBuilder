IC swordsmen skewer Oxford
After a stunning win in Bradford
against a team that was totally out-
classed despite a severe lack of a
third of the team. Mo "Animal"
Mansoori was rumoured to still be in
Bradford after not turning up to the
match, after having travelled most of
the way there. He also got to this
week's a bit late. The Bradford
match was won by the concentrated
efforts of Nick "Manta Ray"
Manton, Ed "Crazy Legs" Rysdale,
Dave "Babyface" Hughes, "Wild
Thing" Reuben, Phil "Perry" Miller
and Thorsten "Sebastian" Meyer.
This was no comparison in the level
of difficulty to the match that was
next - Oxford.
Last year's champions Oxford
arrived at Imperial all bright-eyed
and cheery to face the unbeaten
men's fencing team. The first
weapon fought was foil with Crazy
Legs, Henry "Tweedledum" Morton
and Dave "Tweedledee" Davidge.
The overall score was 7 - 2 with
Crazy Legs and Tweedledum losing
a fight each. This was partially
through Crazy Legs and Tweedle
dum trying to do impressive-looking
hits - Crazy Legs failed to do a jump
reverse flick hit to back, but who's
perfect (certainly not Crazy Legs). A
very good start though!
Next up the sabre team with the
full turnout of Sebastian, Ray and
Animal. Oxford put forward a very
strong team consisting of Rentboy,
the Rose and N-man. The match was
closely fought with many individual
fights going to 5-4. When the score
was 4-4 in fights (only one left),
Animal took on Rentboy in a final
fight spectacular. Animal took an
early lead of 4-0, but through non-
electric judging and Animal's self-
delusion of already having won,
Rentboy equalised. At 4-4, Animal
had to pull off something special and
did so with a stunning parry-riposte
to win the sabre. The sabre team had
won again. The epee team had to win
two fights to complete the victory,
could they do it?
The epee team consisted of Crazy
Legs and Tweedledum (yes they
fought again), and Nigel the "Old
Geezer". After three fights the
epeeists had won the overall match
(nice one Eddie). After this the
Oxford team seemed to be trying
harder to prevent a total white-wash,
but our fencers didn't seem to be try-
ing too hard now the overall match
was won. Tweedledum got injured
and so had to be replaced by the epee
reserve Perry who fenced well and
destroyed the Oxford left-handed
epeeist that had done quite well with
the other two fencers. Unfortunately
the overall epee was lost 5-4 in the
last fight (hard luck Eddie).
As the overall score was 16-11 to
IC, Crazy Legs (who just happens to
the only Mary's fencer on the team)
was "We're the best team from IC
'cos we're still in BUSA," and after
some consideration added, "The only
other team that's decent is the Boat
Club, they've probably got as many
internationals as we have." IC's
men's fencing team is now in the
finals of the BUSA Team Cup,
which is held in Birmingham in a
couple of weeks time. We have all
confidence in winning, as the match
goes all the way to the final (which is
contested on the Sunday), consider-
ing we met our hardest team yet we
won by a considerable margin.
Special mentions go to Old Geezer
who's the oldest on the team (and at
the match) and still won his fights,
and to Animal who's the youngest
fencer on the team by a fair margin
for winning the deciding fight in the
sabre. A note of commiseration to
Oxford who went home defeated and
shame-faced for even thinking for a
second that they could beat us. The
sad fact is that they weren't that great
at drinking either (the "black and
white" game was an absolute mys-
tery to them, never mind).
ICy Snowmen keep their cool
The IC ski team gained another good
resuly last Sunday at the King's Ski
Club parallel slalom race.
Dan, Caitlin, Xavier, Nick and
Paul fought off fierce competition in
the first two rounds, winning evey
race to earn a place in the final
(ahead of Cambridge!) Despite a
valiant attempt, the team were beaten
into second place. This was an excel-
lent performance considering that the
winning team consisted mainly of
English National team members -
well done!
IC runners embrace EC
As the sun crept up on Saturday fif-
teenth, the IC cross country club
flickered into action. Yellow-arse
[Alright there, Mr Arse! - Sports
Eds] rejoiced about the perfect blue
sky for half an hour, whilst others
nursed their hangovers or cracked
open another beverage. One hun-
dred-and-fifty foreigners were left to
sleep in the Southside Gym as we
prepared for the day's events.
Once again, the prestigious Hyde
Park Relays were upon IC, causing
havoc and nearly destruction for the
weekend, facilities for the day were
set up and registration started at
eleven. In typical style, no-one
showed up until half twelve where
clocked a time comparable to the age
of the universe. They still beat
Kings, which is what counts.
The Bristol team, having recently
come second in the BUSA champi-
onships, captured the spirit of the day
with outstanding times and yet a
Iighthearted approach. Oxford and
Cambridge came second and third,
with IC's A team nineteenth.
Afterwards teas were dished out
and prizes presented. Everyone then
proceeded with the consumption of
much beer and a party. Boat racing
was officiated in the union foyer,
with Gaffer at the helm, following a
minor indiscretion with a member of
the Leeds team the afforementioned
upon chaos ensued. By one we had a
field of six hundred competitors.
A minor catch was an unmarked
course five minutes before the start.
Emergency measures were taken
with last-minute strategic positioning
of parents/runners and flags enabling
competitors to negotiate their way
around the Serpentine.
Yellow-arse lead for the first mile
(on his bike) clearing the course of
obstructions (children/dogs/pedestri-
ans). IC's Pony Tail impressively
hurdled the carnage to lead the front
runners. Unfortunately, this domina-
tion of the race was short lived, prob-
ably thanks to the influence of the
Dutch team and debauchery in the
bar on the previous three nights.
Another factor was Gaffer missing
his change-over (this is a relay race)
having got carried away with himself
in the loo. However, IC's ladies
shone on the day, achieving the third
best time for a team, with Jennie Cox
topping her field with just over
eleven minutes for a lap of the
Serpentine. Our B team ironically
were surpassed by the C team having
athlete was showered with at least
three pints of beer. Events then
became a bit hazy.
A student might consider this a
normal series of events for a
Saturday night, but the difference
here is that this was organised by IC
students for a race which is
renowned throughout Europe's run-
ning community. None of this would
have been possible without the help
of the union, security, St Johns,
RAG, marshals and the members of
IC cross-country - thank you. The
difficulty of organising one of the
largest European student relays can-
not be appreciated by observing the
surface of the event, without the
above people it would have been
impossible.
Preparations for next year's event
are already underway, as it is the
fiftieth anniversary. There are hopes
for an all-star team, indeed Seb Coe
and David Moorcroft are two of the
more famous runners to have raced
here. Well done to everyone who
helped or entered, this was an unfor-
gettable experience.
