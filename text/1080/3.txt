FELIX FRIDAY 21ST FEBRUARY NEWS 3
Heritage minister placed on defensive
N E W S T E A M
The Secretary of State for National
Heritage, Virginia Bottomry, admit-
ted on Wednesday in a speech to
Imperial College's Conservative
Society, that the Government is in a
very difficult predicament and that
"Small majorities are grim."
Nevertheless Mrs Bottomley denied
that recent deals with Ulster
Unionists were evidence of the
Government favouring one party
over another.
The Member of Parliament for
Surrey South West also denied
knowing the "ins and outs" of the
Conservative Party finances. She
insisted that her party's sources of
funding did not worry her and
expressed "outrage" at the sugges-
tion that donations to political parties
should be declared.
Mrs Bottomley repeatedly insisted
that the electorate does not under-
stand "how straight government is",
whether it be in dealings with the dif-
ferent parties in Northern Ireland or
in accepting influence from foreign
benefactors of the Conservative
Party. She further expressed her

regret at the direction Parliament has
taken following the Nolan
Commission on standards in public
life.
Just as the Conservative Society's
previous speaker, Peter Lilley,
refused to rule himself out of any
future Conservative leadership battle,
Virginia Bottomley did likewise
albeit with considerably less vigour.
She chastised her Cabinet colleagues,
who she believes are "auditioning for
solo acts" in their attempts to posi-
tion themselves in the run up for the
expected leadership race after the
next election.
With the recent introduction of the
extra Wednesday draw, the Minister
responsible for overseeing the
Lottery and the distribution of its
millions resolutely defended it from
attack. She insisted that the "average
family spend" is no more than £2.50
and that there was no proof that char-
ities or low income families were
being adversely affected.
The former Secretary of State for
Health expressed her gratitude to the
Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, for his
support during her attempts to imple-
ment the Tomlinson Report on the
merger of London hospitals. "For all
the grief that 1 got about the changes
in London, the science community
was always behind me", she said,
going on to reflect on her time in the
Department of Health.
Whilst admitting that her current
position involves such pleasurable
activities as going to football match-
es, Arsenal versus Manchester
United being the latest, Mrs
Bottomley was reluctant to pinpoint
the achievement of which she is most
proud. Assisted by her Private
Secretary, Mrs Bottomley eventually
admitted that "putting in place the
framework for the introduction of
Digital Terrestrial Television" was
one of her greatest moments.
