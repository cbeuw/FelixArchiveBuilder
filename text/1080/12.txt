12 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 21ST FEBRUARY
I wasn't going to mention IC at all
this week, preferring a side-swipe at
Europe, but a few things cannot go
unremarked. It was nice to see that
my long-time sparring partner Ian
Caldwell got his name in print (mind
you, I've been helping there for
years). I was delighted to hear that he
is "quite interested in the design of
buildings and how they used their
space and dimensions." May I sug-
gest a little less time in the Tate and
a bit more in the BMS, along with
your colleagues from Mary's. Lots of
space, not many uses. Speaking of
buildings, my position on the Library
closure has changed from indiffer-
ence to anger. The first time in 12
months that I need to photocopy
something there, and it's closed.
Though we all should have known
that the no closure policy was as like-
ly as the SCR getting three Michelin
stars, it is a shambles. I have tracked
down Schal's fees to about £3mil-
lion. Nice to know we've bought in
real expertise.
As the European supply of spanners
is gradually thrown into the E M U
machine, it looks like one or two
Simon B a k e r
have really hit the
target. It appears that
Germany will not
meet the Maastricht cri
teria on debt and
deficit. This is
because its
attempts to cut
the deficit are
throwing peo-
ple on the dole
like nobody's
b u s i n e s s ,
pushing up
social security,
reducing the
tax receipts,
increasing debt
and, you've
guessed it, the
deficit. Welcome to
Mickey Mouse econom
ics, or as we are sup-
posed to call it the \ Z 0 } C 6 ( ) f
'social model'. This
is the example that people say Britain
should follow.
Fortunately, we aren't. As our
unemployment falls, theirs rises. Our
economy is growing, theirs is stag-
nating. German companies are
investing heavily in
Britain and even
transferring here on
account of the inflexible
workforce and crip-
pling employer
costs in their
native country.
Our economy,
described as
the post-
Thatcherite,
p o s t - E R M
e n t e r p r i s e
economy, is
often labelled a
sweat shop
economy. We
pay appaling
wages to be com-
petitive. All the new
jobs created in the last
five years aren't
R e a s o n p r o p e r f u i i t i m e
positions but low-
skill, part-time work. Not the case,
I'm glad to say. The percentage of
the workforce in temporary employ-
ment is lower here than in either
France, Germany or Spain. Average
take home pay here is significantly
higher here than in France or Spain
and only £800 per year less than
Germany. The reason is that taxes are
significantly higher on the continent
than here. Britain has been universal-
ly praised for the steps taken to re-
structure our economy in the 80s.
The rest of Europe has yet to do this,
and seems more concerned with
playing politics with people's liveli-
hoods in the name of federalism. We
are best to avoid this like the plague.
Let me say however, that before I
give the government all the credit for
this, it must be remembered that our
recent economic success stems from
the failure of our previous policy,
namely membership of the E R M .
Still, there is nothing wrong with
serendipitous discoveries. And if it
ain't broke, don't fix it.
Oh and by the way, I read in IC
Distorter that there are two Crown-
appointed places on the Governing
Body up for grabs, for which nomi-
nations are invited from staff and stu-
dents. Lord Vincent, I know that you
are an avid reader of my humble
prose, and would like to say that I
have space in my diary...

gave to the
problems cou-
ples face in
adopting children. This followed a
Government announcement that cou-
ples refused the chance to adopt a
child will be able to appeal. Couples
will be able to see the assessment
report that led to their not being
allowed to adopt, and the make-up of
the panel who decides will allow for
more 'lay' members, including
someone who adopted or was adopt-
ed. People will only be allowed to
remain on the adoption panel for up
to six years, to prevent 'professional'
panel members from controlling the
system.
These new measures were sparked
off by a number of well-publicised
cases where couples were refused the
chance to adopt children for ostensi-
bly politically correct reasons: the
most famous case was of Jim and
Roma Lawrence, who were told they
were not allowed to adopt a mixed-
race child because of their apparent
lack of understanding of racial
issues, despite Mrs Lawrence being
born to an Asian family in Guyana.
Stephen Dorrell, the Health
Secretary, in announcing the plans,
said "decisions about which parents
are able to adopt children should
reflect common-sense values that are
widely shared throughout society,
and shouldn't reflect the rather spe-
cialist and fashionable theories of a
particular professional group [ie
social workers]".
Although I know certain ministers
enjoy every opportunity they have to
stick the knife into social workers
and political correctness, and that
Dorrell is getting a say in any issue
he can (he's going for the party lead-
ership), I have to agree with what the
Government is doing. So does the
British Association for Adoption and
Fostering (BAAF) who said that
"anything that makes adoption more
open and accountable would be wel-
comed. ..". The B A A F also defended
social workers, arguing that they act
in the best interests of the child and it
is natural that parents may feel
aggrieved in being refused the
chance to adopt, but that the child
had to come first. I expect the major-
ity of social workers are making a
reasonable effort at a tortuously dif-
ficult job, and the moronic criteria
some of their peers have been using
has received the negative publicity
that tars them all with the same
brush.
These new regulations have pre-
cipitated debate on the wider adop-
tion issues: did you know only 400
children were formally adopted last
year? Yet there are 55000 children in
care - and their fate is not something
we can be proud of - three-quarters
of them leave with no qualifications
and many end up in prison. There are
plenty of couples wishing to adopt,
with 20 applying for each child
Surely if even some of these were to
adopt, the potential for giving thou-
sands of children a better start in life
saving vast quantities of public
money and making everyone happier
all round would be enormous
However, I am informed by those
who know better that many of these
children are 'damaged' and therefore
need expensive treatment and highly
skilled social workers to nurture
them. John Major's belief "that it is
important for children to be brought
up in the stability of a home rather
than being institutionalised in chil-
dren's homes or drifting between
foster families" was described as
"devastatingly banal" by an
Independent columnist.
Personally, if I was given the
choice between institution and
adopted home, it wouldn't be a diffi
cult one.
T h e W e e k l y P o e m
It is the stories that we tell our-
selves that are to blame
The future-maps, the hopes and
expectations
That are essential for the ourney on
For if a story mocks reality, the map
is incorrect
Our chosen path is treacherous,
becomes a sheer cliff
Then darkness falls and we are lost
And since reality is fixed
Though we cling on, the story must
be changed
But first we need to route the culprit
out
Before we can replace and amend
Yet here our mind, with many devi-
ous trick
Hides our precious dream and keeps
us blind
But rescue comes externally
Passing remarks that seem incongru-
ous at first
Are signposts to the paths that lead
astray:
Slowly our eys are opened so that
we may write
New stories. These will lead us on
New journeys to a gentler, richer
place
