Last week, Imperial College's
Electrical Engineering Department
scored 24/24 in an HEFCE teaching
quality assessment. Only one other
EE department in the country has
ever equalled this, the highest score
ever achieved by any department at
IC.
A team of assessors studied all the
departments' teaching activities at
both undergraduate and postgraduate
level over a period of three days.
They sat in on lectures and discussed
aspects of the course with both lec-
turers and students.
Speaking to Felix, Dr J. Cozens,
head of undergraduate teaching
explained: "The assessors had a
broad and detailed look at the depart-
ment. They told us they had tried to
get the students to criticise the
department but had failed. This result
will increase people's estimation of

The HEFCE assessments are a rel-
ative innovation, having been intro-
duced only two years ago. The asses-
sors have not yet been able to visit
every U K University department. At
the time of going to press, Only the
following Imperial College depart-
ments have been assessed: Electrical
Engineering (24 points), 1SET (23
points), Chemical Engineering (22
points), and Civil Engineering with
21 points. Reassessment takes place
approximately once every five years.
During the HEFCE exercise, each
department is assessed against its
own standards - whether it performs
as well as it claims, and so no direct
comparisons between institutions are
possible. As a result, Essex
University's EE Department scored
the maximum 24 points while the
equivalent department at Cambridge
University received only 23. Thus,
the rating does not necessarily reflect
the quality of degree available.
Nevertheless, members of the
Imperial College Electrical
Engineering Department maintain
that this award of top marks demon-
strates the high standards prevalent
among both staff and students.
Dearing Inquiry visitors fail to educate
IMEWSTEAM
Four representatives from the
Dearing Inquiry, set up to advise the
government on the future of funding
for Higher education, came to
Imperial College Union on Tuesday
to speak to students and gauge their
views on funding solutions currently
under discussion.
The four members of the inquiry
present included former IC Rector,
Sir Eric Ash, The current Rector, Sir
Ronald Oxburgh, the committee's
student representative from Cardiff
University, Simon Wright and final-
ly, Sir William Stubbs, who
described himself as "just trying to
understand what goes on."
Sir Ronald Oxburgh began the
meeting with a comprehensive intro-
duction. He explained that while pri-
mary and secondary education might
be high on the agendas of all political
parties, Higher education was not.
Roughly one in three currently go on
into HE, and if that number is to
increase then so must the funding. In
addition, many courses are becoming
increasingly expensive to teach,
especially at more prestigious univer-
sities. Sir Ronald stated: "One way or
another, there is going to be pressure
on funds."
The Dearing Inquiry, The Rector
explained, was set up to address this
perceived crisis in Universities,
many of which believe they will be
unable to continue to fulfil their
obligation to students if the situation
does not improve. Among the
options the inquiry hopes to put to
the government is that students con-
tribute towards the cost of their own
higher education, either through larg-
er student loans, or through a higher
rate of income tax for graduates.
Such a proposal, according to Sir
Ronald, would have to be "...framed
in such a way as to be acceptable to
the student population. ...And have
the minimum deterrent effect upon
students seeking to enter university."
The Rector went on to draw com-
parisons between the British HE sys-
tem and the command economies of
former Eastern Bloc states, pointing
out that the government decides how
many Universities there should be,
how many students, and how much
money is allocated for students on
different courses. If money came to
Universities via the students them-
selves, Sir Ronald claimed, then stu-
dents would be significantly more
empowered and would be guaranteed
value for money, becoming the 'con-
sumers 1
of the education system.
In addition to loans and a graduate
tax, The Rector also briefly men-
tioned other schemes under consider-
ation, such as the Labour Party's pro-
posed 'Learning bank' in which fees
would be partly met from a learning
account set up for each child, and the
French system, whereby students can
