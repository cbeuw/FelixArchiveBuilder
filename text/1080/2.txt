Health centre delayed
KATY N O L A N
After a series of delays, college
health services will finally move into
their new Southside site in mid
March.
The new centre was due to open
last October, but complaints from
students living above the site led to
building works being delayed until
after July. Ian Caldwell, IC's
Director of Estates, explained: "No-
one anticipated how much noise the
work would transmit to the resi-
dences above. So, we decided to stop
work until after the exams".
Since October a variety of prob-
lems, including the air conditioning
system, have further prevented the
building from opening. Chris Cooke,

Practice Manager at the centre, said
of the delays "Constuction difficul-
ties covers a multitude of sins".
The existing health centre in
Princes Gardens fails to meet regula-
tions governing disabled access.
Currently, in order to see the dentist
or nurse patients must negotiate
stairs. The new centre has will have
lifts to all levels.
The finishing touches are being
put to the building at the moment.
The staff are expected to move in
during 21-24th March. Mr Cooke
has said "We can't waif'.This new
site will be the permanent home of
the health centre and although it has
a larger capacity there will be no new
staff employed.

W O M E N S ' HONOUR
DEFENDED
Natalia Thorn, Vice President of
King's College Student Union, put
forward a motion at the University of
London Union General Union
Council meeting on Monday to 'do
away with the position of Womens'
Officer as part of ULU's executive
committee' with effect from the next
election.
Ms Thorn's motion proposed that
'...Women now hold an equal status
with men' and that 'any issues spe-
cific to women in U L U ...can be han-
dled with thorough competence by
an "equal opportunities officer" and
thus called for the position of
Womens' Officer be replaced by one
which covered all groups of people.
At the moment, The ULU executive
has no officer specifically appointed
to address issues such as disabilities
or racial prejudice.
An opposing motion was put for-
ward by Paul Bates, ULU's V P for
welfare and representation. He
explained that Student Union
Womens' Officers 'promote sexual
equality' and that they were 'vital' to
student unions. He went on to sug-
gest that there should be a campaign
to establish them at all colleges with-
in the University of London.
The council voted for to maintain
the post of Womens' Officer with a
two-thirds majority.

'INTELLECTUAL RACIST'
C E N S U R E D
A motion proposed by Damian
Krushner, university councillor, at
this week's U L U General Union
Council sought to "...oppose any
attempt by organisations or individu-
als within the University of London
to give a platform" to Cristopher
Brand, an ex-lecturer at Edinburgh
University. The motion alledged that
Mr Brand was a 'pseudo-intellectual
racist'.
Brand had proposed a motion at
Cambridge University on the 23rd of
January this year in which he pro-
moted the idea that 'black people
were inherently less intelligent than
whites'. He also sought to deny the
rights of Asians and Afro-Caribbean
students to education and welfare.
The IC delegation at the meeting
voted against the motion on the
grounds of defending freedom of
expression. Nevertheless, the motion
was carried.
P A N E FINALLY DROPS
FOR CIVIL ENGINEERS
A serious accident was narrowly
avoided last Thursday lunchtime,
when a large pane of glass fell from
the Civil Engineering building and
smashed onto the road below.
College security acted quickly to
cordon off the wide area of broken
glass, in the access road connecting
Dalby Court and Imperial College
Road. High winds are widely
believed to have dislodged the pane
of glass, which measured approxi-
mately a metre square. Although the
road was busy at the time, no-one
was injured.
ULU V P AIMS FOR M A R S
Paul Bates, University of London
Union vice-president (Welfare and
Representation), has written to
NASA to determine the possibility of
his accompanying them on any
future manned mission to Mars. This
move follows a U L U mandate,
expressing the desire of the London
Union, as a student representative
body, to further relations with extra-
terrestrial beings.
Included in the Union's radical
new policy is the explicit instruction
that the Carpenters' hit, 'Calling
occupants of interplanetary craft' be
played at least once per day over the
U L U building intercom.
So far, NASA have not responded.
