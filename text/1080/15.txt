FELIX FRIDAY 21ST FEBRUARY SPORT 15
T H E L A T E S T SCORE
From Felix's sports pundit Dave Robinson.
OK I got my prediction wrong, but
things aren't that bad, so did every-
one else. Virtually every programme
on air has gone through the motions
of dredging up all the usual ideas -
the fact is that Glenn Hoddle's
England were not good enough for
Italy on the night. We're not talking
a Taylor scale disaster, just a fluke
result, things are still moving for-
ward, not rapidly declining as they
were in 1993.
It was pretty amusing to hear the
supposed experts blaming every-
thing from influence of foreign play-
ers in our game to the amount of
money amassed by our top clubs.
What exactly are these supposed
pundits talking about ? When Man
Utd leaked 14 goals in three games
no one fundamentally questioned
Alex Ferguson's youth policy or
wrote off Peter Schmeical as a poor
keeper. Yet when England are pretty
unlucky against one of the world's
best sides at Wembley the entire
team are cast off. If you believed the
more outrageous sports writers Le
Tissier wouldn't get another game
for Southampton and Ian Walker and
Sol Campbell would be dropped for
eternity. I said last week that
Ferdinand, Merson and Martyn
should be in the side and I stand by
what I said, but I don't pretend that I
could do a better job than Hoddle.
The fact is that Shearer struggled
against his young marker and it was
Le Tissier who got the space and
consequently the chances. Campbell
was always going to struggle in that
defence and Pearce was marking
Zola when the pass was made.
A certain Howard Wilkinson, the
FA's Technical Director was heard
to say that young players aren't get-
ting the chance. Has this bloke been
locked in his office since cocking up
Leeds ? The present sides fielded by
teams such as Man Utd, Liverpool,
Spurs, Chelsea, Leicester,
Wimbledon and even Arsenal con-
tain exciting new talent. The excep-
tions to the rule are probably
Newcastle and Middlesborough, but
even at those clubs Darren
Huckerby and Phil Stamp have
caught the eye.
The growing gap between the per-
ceived rich and poor was also regur-
gitated, surely the consistently good
performances against richer teams
by Wimbledon, Chesterfield,
Stockport, Wrexham and
Portsmouth suggest that the gap is
only financial and that many of the
smaller teams are better organised
and play with more spirit. The exam-
ples of Millwall, Bournemouth,
Brighton and other cash struck clubs
are all very well, but that is due to
bad management rather than uneven
distribution of wealth. Small clubs
can survive in the big time,
Wimbledon in the Premier, Grimsby
in the First (just) and sides run on a
shoestring like Doncaster and
Scarborough in the third prove that.
Mike Atherton pulled off his usual
trick of putting in a world class per-
formance in the last test of the winter
to survive into the early stage of the
summer, on the field for over fourl
days solidly playing two near fault-
less innings. His ability to pull off|
escapes that Houdini would be proud
of is near legendary, his 140 not out
to save the test in South Africa last
year confirmed his status as the
world's most stubborn batsman on
his day. He has now developed a
knack of catapulting himself up the
rankings in time for the summer
home tests. The only other England
player who really contributed was
Robert Croft who was only thirty
runs short with the bat of the cumu-
lative total made by the other five
members of Engand's elite batting
club in the first innings. The consid-
erable ease with which a teenager
was able to polish off England's
attack in both innings can only have
dismayed the captain.
Maashaallah for the Arabian knights
The long-awaited OSC five-a-side
football tournament was won by the
Arabic team in a thrilling final
against the Hellenic team which they
won five-one. A full report next
week in our bumper sports issue.
Watch out, watch out, gunmen about
The Courtman Shield match has
been moved to the eigth of March to
allow the City and Guilds dream
team to shoot for Great Britain, so
you have put your name down for
this make a note in your diary. The
next match is this Saturday at Bisley
for the BUSF pistol championships
so git to the sports centre early if you
are in one of the teams. More clay
pigeon shooting will take place
around Easter and everyone (even
non-members) are welcome. See the
notices in the range when they go up.
Romeos, Romeos, wherefore
art thou Romeos?
Although the fourth's unbeaten run
had seemed to last as long as the
Hundred Years War it was inevitable
that it would end. Halley's comet
may only come round every eighty-
one years but we shall return to con-
quer again as soon as Saturday in our
next league match.
On the day after Valentine's day
the cards were on the table for IC
even before the kick-off. Missing six
first team regulars [off swanning
about with their girlfriends, the ran-
doms - Sports Eds] and playing
against fellow promotion contenders
we were always going to struggle.
After taking an early lead through
Lee, making his senior debut, IC
were forced to weather a barrage of
pressure. Queen Mary's twice hit the
woodwork in the same attack before
their equaliser, then the controversial
winner was scored. With the refer-
ee's line of sight blocked the striker
used his arm to control a bouncing
ball and drilled it past the 'keeper.
In the second half we huffed and
puffed but couldn't blow the Mary's
defence down. Thanks to new boys
Andy, Andy, Ivan, John and Lee.
IC tennis aced wholeheartedly
Although a disappointment, on paper
it seemed inevitable for the men's
and ladies' teams. Nottingham are
the number two seeds in the country
after Loughborough. IC tennis team
usually enjoys good success in the
BUSA. the men's team has reached
the quarter-finals in '93, '94 and '96.
The record of the ladies' team is not
so illustrious, as this is the first time
in years the we have had one. Under
the excellent captaincy of Caroling
Wood, they have made a good start
to the year.
The team was well prepared. Over
the Christmas hols, IC had been
training with the Warsaw University
team at Queen's Club and Westway
sports centre - the return match after
last year's unforgetable tour to
Poland.
Team members for the ladies were
Alesia, Caroline Wood, Kathy Shair
and Dalia Fontes. For the men
Florian Reinaud, Paraag Dave, Dan
Gleich and Stuart Riley. Closest
results were by Stuart 3-6, 6-3, 6-3
and Dan 6-7, 6-7.
It was a shame that Nottingham
chose not to celebrate by sampling
Caroline's well-prepared treats and
ran off home (unsociable sods!).
The tennis team's plan is to play
some friendly matches and organise
a tour for the summer and new play-
ers are always welcome.
