Music Felix 933 8 May 1992
Carter USM
-1992, The Love
Album
Carter's ' 1992' opens with ' 1993',
a sort of opening foray into the
world, and follows with a highlight
of the album, 'Is Wrestling Fixed?',
with a refrain of playground
style...'Am I un-H-A-P-P-Y', and
Carter manage to find a rhyme for
diagnosis. Almost certainly single
material, if it were not for the
closing line of the first verse: 'an
open and shut hopeless fucking
case'.
You've all heard 'New Cross'
(haven't you?), so onto 'Suppose
You Gave a Funeral, and Nobody
Came', about Robert Maxwell's
gutter press journalism. Manages to
scupper its chances of 45 glory in
the first line. 'England', with its
fairground backing, about
prostitution, in typical Carter sing-
Crunch -Maximus
This is only the second time I've
seen this band and already they're
moving up in the club circuit. An
all girl rock band of dimunitive
stature, looks are deceiving. The
singer is slightly reminiscent of
Wendy James in her attitude with
the distinct advantage of being able
to sing. Jumping about the stage in
a schoolgirl gym skirt and
camoflage print leggings there is a
certain, definite charisma and
presence about her. With a
powerful vocal performance she is
definitely in control. The guitarist
and bassist laid down some essential
riffs and rhythms, the sole guitarist
switching competently from
crunching rhythm to blistering lead.
They played a fairly short forty-five
minute set with a few numbers I
could remember from six months
previously like Little Boy and
Inbetween mixed with newer
material. Their guitarist is a new
addition replacing the one they were
borrowing previously and has to
take much of the credit for the
bands rise from pubs to big clubs.
This band is definitely a rock band
and, as such, is unlikely to ever
surface in the charts but for anyone
who has any faith left in the music
industry it seems they must soon
capture a recording contract. I
certainly hope they make it because
they have the dedication and
potential needed and maybe if
anyone from Rock Soc is reading
this we could see them playing at
Imperial within the next year or so.

Beautiful South
-Brixton Academy
a-long style. First side over, and no
radical departures from mass-
produced Carterism.
'Do Re Me So Far So Good", the
next single attacks attitude-free pop
stars with vitriol and manages to do
it without falling foul of any
potential Radio One censors; 'Look
Mum No Hands' deals with
terrorism in a pretty non-descript
manner; onto 'While You Were
Out', about separation, which
manages to incorporate all possible
Carterisms into one song.
Time to weird out, I think. 'Sky
West and Crooked'—who knows
what it's all about. Card games
possibly. It ends with Ian Dury
reading from 'The Man of La
Mancha', reminiscent of Frankie
GTH's 'War' and then into 'The
Impossible Dream', a song from the
same. Bizarre. Full steam ahead for
European Carter integration.

• '1992' is out now on Chrysalis.
If you dropped your wallet tonight
here tonight I reckon you'd get it
back with it's contents intact. Such
was the crowd. They seemed to like
Blammo, the second support act.
'Magic Pencil' and 'Sharon Wilson'
(does everyone know a Sharon
Wilson?) were funny. Football
songs I'd say. The first support
band were dull, dull, dull. Sweet
but dull.
Then came The Beautiful South.
Northern Scum their logo, I like
that. They didn't talk, 'cept for a
few short words, I like that, I can't
be done with all this 'Hello London'
shite. They did new ones; 'Old Red
Eyes...', and old ones; 'A Little
Time', which most people, much to
my annoyance, felt the need to sing
along to. They sagged at times, they
were a bit too glossy at times, but
they pulled through and I was
definitely won over by their
rendition of 'You Should Be
Dancing'. But unfortunately most
people didn't want to dance or
weren't quite sure how appropriate
it was. Such was the crowd.

SexCarter: 1992 and all that.
The Cure
-Friday, I'm in
Love
A colossal, mechanoid groove is
underpinned by whispered
cybervocals. The spectrum, in it's
entirety, is given short shrift at 40p
per full colour A4, and 80p for A3.
But nothing prepares you for the
sudden vicious mood-change;
angular and monotone
reproductions swirl out of the black
and white noise at 5p per A4 and
lOp per A3. If you don't believe it,
come into the office. It's so easy to
get addicted.
Der Kdnig von Hamburg.
T don't care if Monday's blue,
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday
too, Thursdays, 1 don't care about
you...'
Nonsensical claptrap from Robert
Smith and the Cure, whimsical pap,
irrelevant crap. Damn catchy stuff,
mind, and slightly less Curelike
than usual, massive chart hit
material, and I'm actually quite
partial to it.
Bastards.

• 'Friday' is out next Friday,
through Fiction, Polydor.
