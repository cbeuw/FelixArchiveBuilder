Confusion
Japanese
Success
There was considerable confusion
last night over the legality of the
funding of Silwood Park Day
Nursery. A meeting of Imperial
College Union Finance Committee
(UFC), held on Tuesday night,
decided that the payment of £50 by
Silwood Students' Union to the
nursery was illegal (ultra vires).
Subsequently, senior union officers
telephoned Silwood to instruct
union members there to end funding
of the nursery.
Independent observers told
Imperial College News Network
(iCNN) that the funding of the
nursery is not illegal. If this opinion
is correct, it means that the two year
old decision by IC Union to cut the
funding to the Imperial College Day
Nursery, in Prince's Gardens, was
unnecessary, and that funding to
Silwood Day Nursery can be
restored.
The confusion is due to the lack
of a firm definition of an ultra vires
payment. In 1983 the Attorney
General issued guidelines defining
what was improper expenditure by
student unions. This followed
allegations that student unions, most
of which have charitable status, had
been making large donations to
political bodies, during the
politically sensitive miners' strike.
The 1983 letter from the Attorney
General read that all expenditure
should be seen to be 'representing
and furthering the interests of the
students' and should 'assist in the
educational aims of the college'.
This has been taken by IC Union
officers to mean that all expenditure
must give some form of return to
students, in terms of material
benefits or services. On this basis,
it has been decided that the nursery
does not give direct benefit to
students, an interpretation which
itself has been questioned.
A solicitor for the Attorney
General's office yesterday told
iCNN that an ultra vires payment
was one where money was used for
party political purposes. A press
officer for the National Union of
Students told us that for a payment
to be legal, it must have some
educational benefit. Charity
- commissioners, who have financial
auditing responsibilities for most
student unions, said that students'
unions may only spend money on
the beneficiaries named in their
charter.
An independent financial expert
consulted by iCNN told us that the
legal deliberations of the Attorney
General's office were of no
relevance in this instance. He said
that as both Imperial College Union
and the Imperial College Day
Nursery did not exist financially in
their own right, they are regarded,
for charitable status, as parts of the
college. This interpretation was
confirmed for i C N N by the
Charities Commission, who found
Imperial College Union listed as an
integral part of Imperial College. In
this case, the payment of money
from ICU to the Day Nursery could
be regarded as Imperial College
moving money around different
financial departments, and therefore
would not constitute an ultra vires
payment.
Our expert further told us that the
charter that establishes the college
as an exempt charity, states that the
main aim of the college is to educate
students and provide relevant
services to further that goal. In this
light, the Day Nursery aids student
welfare in the same way as halls of
residence and refectories.
As officers of the Union are
accountable and personally liable
for the expenditure they may have
to repay any funds that are spent
improperly. Hence, union officers
are moving with caution on this
issue. The position appears to be
one of correcting past mistakes.
Imperial's Rowing Club has won
the 'Japanese Henley Regatta' for
the second year running. This year
they were pitted against Nihon
University, Wasada University
(Japan) and Bristol University.
They won by a three-quarter length
over Bristol. Bill Mason, the Coach
of the IC Rowing Club, told Felix
that the Regatta was a 'sister event'
to the British race of the same name
and university crews came from all
over the world to compete. 'We
demolished Bristol,' he added.
He said that the two British crews
were given boats cut for Japanese
si7.e. and as the British teams were
on average eight kilos heavier per
person 'we were going under the
waves rather than over them.'
Yesterday (Thursday 7 May), Mr
Mason went with the second eight
to Dublin to compete in the 400th
Trinity Regatta, where they will
compete against a number of Irish
crews.
This victory follows last week's
news that IC Sailing Club won the
Jet Sea Cup Challenge. The Jet Sea
team had difficultly in raising
enough sponsorship money to take
part in the Martinique Challenge.
The team sent professionally
published brochures to over 100
French and British companies but
received no response. The team
then turned to college sponsors. The
Old Centralians (City and Guilds
Old Students' Association)
supported the venture. Funding
applications were made to the
Rector, Sir Eric Ash, to Imperial
College Union and to the Chairman
of IC's Governing Body, Sir Frank
Cooper. The Harlington Trust,
which uses funds generated from
the excavation of gravel from IC's
Harlington sports ground, also
donated funds for the venture. The
team members gave £300 each of
their own money because enough
sponsorship still had not been
raised.
