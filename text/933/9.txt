Talking About
Problems
Don Adlington, Student Counsellor.
In some respects it seems a little
odd that University Students, of all
people, should be thought to need
a range of support services which
are more comprehensive, better
staffed and more accessible than
those available to their peer group
outside. Virtually all universities
have an extensive medical service,
staffed by doctors and nurses who
put a high value on talking to their
patients—hardly an image of
general practice which would be
recognisable to the consumers of
National Health Service medicine in
the country at large. Most
universities have well staffed
student services units where
practical advice and help are
available on demand, and where
students can expect assistance and
sometimes advocacy in their
dealings with bureaucracy. Most
universities, including this one,
have appointed Counsellors whose
brief, in essence, is an open-ended
commitment to helping students
with personal problems. Again the
contrast with the world outside
academia is very great. How can we
justify this inevitable allocation of
scarce resources in favour of the
most articulate, intelligent, and able
sector of the school leaving
population?
even a short
period of stress
can have a
disproportionate
effect
Another way of phrasing the
question perhaps, is this—What is
so special about University
students? There are two sorts of
answers I believe. The most
tendentious and value laden one
involves the economic argument
that University entrants are
themselves scarce resources and
that as an advanced technology
based society we are fully justified,
even obliged, to afford them extra
support and protection. This view,
(of high educational provision
generally) is enthusiastically
embraced by the middle classes,
and is compliantly tolerated by the
working classes. The other sort of
answer, and the one I am most
interested in. concerns the peculiar
nature of a student's occupation,
that is. sustained, systematic and
high level learning, and the
interaction between the learning
process and anxiety, distress and
other emotional disturbances. I do
not believe that on the whole the
contingent life problems that
students have to cope with are
significantly different to those of the
rest of their age group—indeed it
can reasonably be supposed that
they will not. on average, be as bad.
To be sure there are some
occupational hazards which are
assoicated with the intellectual high
flyer, for example academic
excellence may have been attained
partly at the cost of the neglect of
other sorts of skills, particularly
social skills, and it may be true also
that some kinds of stress,
inseparable from university study
are not risks to which non students
are exposed.
The residual, but solid,
justification for professional helping
services in universities is the degree
to which the students' central
activity—study—is impaired by
factors which would be far less
disabling in terms of efficiency for
another person whose occupation
was serving in a shop, digging holes
in the road or working behind a
bank counter. A bereavement, a
broken love relationship, or a
parental divorce, is equally
traumatic for everyone, and the
immediate emotional impact is
precisely the same. For the
university student however, and
particularly perhaps for students at
Colleges like this, where the work
is cumulative and sequential, even
a relatively short period of distress
related inefficiency can have a quite
disproportionate effect.
Other common, but less obvious
sources of distress and anxiety may
also undermine the capacity to study
in a highly insidious way.
For example, the student who
finds it difficult to make friends, or
who feels in other ways out of step
with what he perceives as normal,
may find some of the more
mechanical tasks associated with his
work quite easy to cope with, but
find it virtually impossible to sit and
concentrate on work that requires
abstract thinking. T can't
concentrate": 'my mind wanders off
onto other things'; I spend hours
just looking at my notes, taking
nothing in'; are phrases which are
very familiar to those whose job it
is to help students.
The individual colouring of this
sort of study problem can be
infinitely varied, but in practise
there are some well recognised
patterns into which most people fit
quite easily. Besides the sorts of
problems already mentioned—the
fracture of threat to key
relationships, and the difficulties
engendered by isolation and the
fears associated with it—I have in
mind such problems as anxieties
about one's choice of course, and
possibly about the next move in life,
now that all the more or less
prescribed ones are at an end.
Coping with the competitiveness in
academic work and learning to
recognise the appropriateness or
otherwise of the level of degree one
hopes to achieve. Coping with the
emotional demands of other
students and friends and finding
some sort of formula for dealing
with the more negative aspects of
human behaviour. There are also
the mundane worries about money
and accommodation, about the
planning of one's time and the need
to recognise that time and energy
are finite resources and that
invidious choices have to be made.
There is no doubt that for all these
sorts of difficulty, and many others,
there is much to be said for talking
to someone about them. People
generally, but scientists and
technologists in particular perhaps,
tend to underestimate the simple
value of talking. Many of us, at
times of difficulty almost
automatically turn in on
ourselves—partly out of pride (the
powerful impulse to keep up an
appearance of competence), and
partly out of the inappropriate
rational argument that talking
cannot change hard reality, cannot
alter the substantive roots of our
unhappiness. cannot alter 'the
facts'.
Talking is important and effective
however in a number of ways.
Firstly it enables people to express,
and therefore to ventilate their
(often angry) feelings. Providing
this is done in the right sort of
setting, and with the right sort of
response, it helps to liberate the
energy required to tackle real life
difficulties constructively. Secondly
it is often only by talking about
things that we are able to sort out
one strand from another and make
some sort of coherent picture of the
situation. Thirdly, this more or less
conscious sharing of feelings may
very well lead to new ideas, new
information, new initiatives for
tackling problems.
There are many people in College
to whom students can talk—their
colleagues and friends of course,
but also College staff, tutors,
doctors, student services staff. You
can also talk to me. I am not paid
to do anything else, and my work
is entirely confidential. If you
would like to see me, my office is
at 15 Princes Gardens, and my
telephone number is 3041.
