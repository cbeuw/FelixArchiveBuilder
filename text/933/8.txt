The magnificent Greek islands
are not the only pole of attraction
for tourists during the summer
season. The mysterious and
imposing rocks of Meteora, found
in the western point of Thessalia,
in central Greece, form a strange
rocky forest consisting of over 1000
stony outcrops. Some are huge and
Saint Athanassius the Meteorite,
gave the name to the 'wide stone'
he first climbed in 1344 A . D . The
adjective 'meteor', or in greek,
'meteoros', was derived from the
ancient words nextx (after)-and
aeipo (raise), meaning 'tall' (ie
raised) or 'suspended.' Maybe this
was the most suitable name for the
Meteora
The Rocky Forest of Jesus
Chris
Leontopoulos,
Vice President
of the ICU
Hellenic Society,
describes a
singular and
relatively
unknown part of
Greece
wide, whilst others are small and
meagre, more suggestive of
skeletons. They all tower to the sky,
giving the impression of some other
superworld.
The trunks that make up this
forest gives you the impression of
petrified mythical giants, but the
ringing of nearby churches' bells
and the sight of their domes reminds
you that this is holy property - it is
the 'stony forest of Jesus.' The
ancient monasteries which still
adorn the tops of the rocks retain
their vivid Byzantine colour and
orthodox tradition - an area
untouched by time, an acropolis of
the spirit defending itself against the
materialistic attitudes of the modern
age.

Meteora is an ideal place for
spiritual upljft and meditation. If
you want to learn how to pray, it
is worthwhile going there at night
and staying a little out of the way,
alone. The sky is closer, the stars
shine more vividly and at dawn you
can hear the birds joining with the
monks in their morning praise.
The name 'Meteora' is not
ancient. The founder of the Holy
Monastery of the Transfiguration,
rocks which were to offer
hospitality to people called to live
above the earth, though belonging
to the earth - to live between earth
and heaven.
There is not much historical
evidence concerning the rocks. The
dearth of records, both ancient and
modern, belies the interest to be
found in this splendid place. In his
book 'Thessalia and Ipiros' (1897),
the German Geologist A l .
Philopson remarks on the pebble-
like nature of the rocks and hills and
does not contradict the old tradition
of an ancient sea of Thessaly.
Even the most casual visitor to
the Meteorite monasteries must
wonder how the first monks
ascended those virgin, slippery and
colossal rocks. Originally the visitor
was hauled up in a net basket on the
end of a rope, though today the
ascent is aided by a smooth car
road. The closest town to Meteora
is Kalambaka, its name meaning
'conspicuous fortress,' since the
rocks give the impression of a
gigantic natural fortress from there.
Recently, Kalambaka has developed
into an important town where new
and comfortable hotels are available
for visitors who may want to see the
historic monasteries at their leisure.
