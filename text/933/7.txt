8 May 1992 Felix 933 Feature
with a Reading Room and private
Luncheon Room for the Governors
and Professors from a Gymnasium
with changing rooms and shower
baths. Criticism was made of the
inadequacy of the kitchen and
service accommodation which the
Architect (Sir Aston Webb)
countered by saying that it was as
large as that on board ship, and to
which the meek critic objected that
the building was on land and there
was plenty of it. The use of these
rooms was changed from time to
time to meet the increased demand
for dining room accommodation,
and the Library on the first floor
became an additional Luncheon
Room, the private Luncheon Room
for the Governors and Professors
became also the Secretary's Office,
and the Secretary's Office off the
main Entrance Hall was
transformed into a bar and buffet.
Almost at the same time the
college bookstall was transferred to
the Union and occupied part of the
Entrance Hall on the Albert Hall
level.
The Gymnasium which served
various purposes, for plays,
concerts, dances, boxing and
fencing matches gradually lost
interest as a Gymnasium and the
special apparatus was removed.
The furnishing and equipment of
the building was provided by
donations from the City companies,
the Governors, Professors and old
students.
In its first year
it was regarded
somewhat
timidly by some
of the students
and was by no
means
universally
patronised.
The growing up of the Union may
be divided into two periods
separated by the War. From
1911-1914, in its infancy its growth
was slow but on the whole, in spite
of competing interests, vigorous.
In its first year it was regarded
somewhat timidly by some of the
students and was by no means
universally patronised. It was
interesting to observe how those
who came in by twos and threes as
it were on a voyage of discovery
when once they had investigated the
amenities which it offered, stayed
and induced others also to come.
Gradually its use for all social
events became general. At the
outset entertainment was evident in
plays, concerts—the three colleges
having at that time a wealth of talent
both ont he dramatic and musical
side—and dances.
The rules of the Union laid it
down that the three Colleges should
nominate the President of the Union
in turn, and it fell to the lot of the
Royal School of Mines to nominate
the first President. The Union has
been fortunate in having a
succession of Presidents who were
ready to devote time and energy to
its progress.
During the War the Union served
not only as a meeting place of its
members when on leave, but as the
Headquarters of the United Arts
Volunteer Rifles, and of the
Reserve of Guards Officers. The
collection of photographs which is
now in the Bar was made at this
period. Naturally its ordinary
activities were suspended and, it is
almost ture to say that, after the
War a fresh start had to be made.
From 1918 to the present time
and development in every direction
has been remarkable. Members of
1911 revisiting the Union today
would find the most significant
changes. They would find buildings
to the south, east and west of them,
hostels to house a hundred students,
increased and increasing
accommodation for meals and a
great extension of social activities.
They would find in the Reading
Room a collection of Challenge
Cups (which would excite the envy
of any motor bandit) and of heads
of big game.
They would find the Bar, where
formerly there was only a small
number of pewter tankards, now
resplendent with the finest
collection of them one could wish
to see. An excellent custom has
been introduced in which in many
cases a member when leaving the
college hands his tankard on to a
worthy successor. They would look
in vain for the Bookstall which has
been transferred to the building on
the south where are also the
administrative offices of the
college. And they would regret that
they would not find so many of their
contemporaries as they would like
to see.
Any account of the Union would
be incomplete without a mention of
the remarkable improvement in the

and there was plenty of it.
provision of meals which has taken
place in the last few years. In the
first year the catering was done
under contract by a firm of
professional caterers who did not
find it sufficiently profitable.
Afterwards, as no other firm—not
even Messrs Lyons—would
undertake it, the Committee dicided
to put the responsibility in the hands
of the Secretary. The arrangement
worked satisfactorily until War
broke out with a consequent
decrease in the number of meals and
great difficulty in obtaining
supplies. More recently the
Secretary was relieved of this work
and the catering put in the hands of
a manager and manageress
appointed by the Committee, with
the result that as good fare is
obtainable as anywhere in London
at a charge which is almost
incredibly small.
It would be both superfluous and
impertinent to conclude by saying
that, after twenty-one years, the
Union has more than justified the
hopes of those who founded it. It
would be more pertinent to urge that
in view of its great value to the
College, the very considerable use
to which it is put and the importance
of the services which it renders, the
best tribute that could be paid to its
founders would be to enlarge the
accommodation where it is most
required, and thus ensure its greater
perfection.
