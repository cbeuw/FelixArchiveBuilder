The Inner System
Chapter 15:
Fictionalisation
Stress jogged along the corridors
while he examined the items the
terrorists had given him. He had
with him an instrument similar to
the execdetec which had been
attuned to seek out a science aura.
The signal was very weak at the
moment, Stress wasn't affecting it
at all. The other item was crucial
to his mission, it was a truth gun.
It was small and black and similar
to the futility gun Carefree had used
on him. It fired a short burst of
energy that cleared the victim of all
clouding vision, all false views. The
Lepton had stressed to him how
extremely dangerous this weapon
was.
The corridor ended in a door
marked 'Hollowglam Centre,
Service , Entrance'. Stress went
through the door, down another
tunnel and on to a glass fronted
observation platform overlooking a
very bizarre scene.
Before him was a cavernous
room draped in white columns,
statues, long flowing curtains, white
smoke and stunningly attractive
people standing around smiling and
waving. At the far end of the room
was a massive staircase leading up
to a hole in the roof. Down the
stairway citizens of the system were
slowly descending, reaching the
bottom and walking across the room
into a large white machine.
Emerging from the far side were
shiningly perfect people whore bore
a similar appearance to those that
went in, only far sleeker. A voice
was talking happily from speakers,
repeating one passage over and over
again.
'This is it, citizens. This is the
time when you can lose your
decaying body and become one of
the hollowglams, forever beautiful,
forever young. Soon you will be
leaving your physical chains and
beings of pure energy and beauty.
You will appear on adverts, posters,
celebrity events, supernatural
beings blessed with perfection. This
is it citizens...'
'Can I help you?'
Stress twisted around to meet an
idyllic young woman holding a slim
Dear Marge
Acht well, Easter over and back to
face those lovely end of year exams.
So what of the end of last term. It
seems that just before the end of
term several more couples were
discovered being discreet and
unavoidable and several more not
being discreet at all, in fact they
were being blatantly obvious about
it all in the middle of Beit Quad.
What can I say except for the fact
that we know who you are and
bribes of £449.50 will ensure that
your name never appears on this
page. As for other names that
should never appear on this page;
yes of course we are referring to our
beloved college management team
who are of course all working
together to ensure that students at
Imperial are comfortable and well
off. Not bloody likely!- It seems that
their main task at the moment is to
ensure that that Fraser bloke is well
off in comfortable apartments and
that the rest of the 'team' are
stopped from telling the truth about
the situation. One instance
immediately springs to mind - at
meetings with students from
Southside over the state of the
accommodation. Nudge, nudge,
wink, wink, say no more - which
incidentally is exactly what M r
Marshall (Estates Manager) was
told to do. I am of course referring
to the meeting held between Gordon
Marshall, Angus Fraser and a
handful of students from Southside
halls to discuss the state of the
accommodation at Imperial. It
seems that due to the firm hand of
Mr Fraser nothing was actually
said. I wonder why? The
alternative lifestyle of having skin
head hair cuts has seemed to have
taken over this otherwise generally
mellow corner of the world. The
photography 'man' had all his
shaved off, Rachel 'Rag Chair
Elect' Mountford has had hers
cropped rather short and even I
have succumbed to the pressure and
did it myself... but who is to say
that we are talking about the hairs
on our head? As for the RCS
Charity/May Ball, well lets just say
that some continental fool made a
few revelations in the direction of
one of my most treasured in
formers. To this young gentleman
I have two words - Woof and
Cherry. I trust that the person(s)
concerned know the rules, I do
accept all major credit cards and
cheques if used with a bankers card.
It also seems that a new sweepstake
has to be opened. Rachel 'Rag
Chair Elect' Mountford, sex
symbol extraordinaire, has been the
attention of many young men's
midnight fantasies in recent weeks,
the stakes currently stand thus:
Alex Taverner 5:1; Vinny Rai
1:1; Daniel 'Polishsurnameski' 3:1;
staff. She was dressed in a flowing
gown and seemed to be fixed in a
loop of smiling, tossing her hair and
looking sidelong.
'What's going on?'
'When good citizens reach a
certain age they are able to come
down here and shed their imperfect
bodies to become hollowglams.
perfect people like me.'
Smile, toss the hair, look
sidelong.
'What exactly happens to them?'
'They enter the machine their
bodies are destroyed and a three-
dimensional, power driven, perfect
image is constructed.'
'But what happens to their minds,
their brains?'
'Who needs brains when you
have perfect teeth.'
Smile, toss the hair, look
sidelong.
'You kill them!'
'Oh no, they do it willingly, it is
the ultimate award. They would
commit suicide if they were forced
to enter middle age.'
The last two words seemed to
cause pain to the hollowglam.
'Wait a second, don't you realise
what I am?'
'I'm sorry no. You imperfects all
look alike.'
'I'm a pale one.'
Stress very much wanted to
remove the smile.
'What's that, oh, I remember.'
Realisation dawned. The
hollowglam screamed. Stress
decided it was time to go. He
dodged around the stunned
hollowglam and ran back down the
tunnel. Pulling the door open he
stared into a pursuit cop's chest.
Poddy 'My name is not Ian Davies
honest' 20:1; Marc Ellis 18:1;
Marge 7:6 (fav).

Dear Marge,
Oh no, oh no, oh no... I'm in the
middle of my finals and I'm running
an election campaign for Hon Sec
(Events). I've just photocopied
some notes and now I can't find a
stapler anywhere. Marge, can you
help?
Yours Frantic.
Dearest Frantic,
No.
Marge.
