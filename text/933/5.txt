One of the chief problems of
modern reform is to improve the
conditions under which people now
live; yet, to improve the qualities
of the generations of the future is
surely a problem of equal, if not of
surpassing importance. The study
of this problem is called Eugenics.
It is not, as many suppose, a
scheme for marrying prize-fighters
Yet. though the harm due to
short-sighted legislation, misplaced
charity and other causes is evident,
progress has been made in other
directions. Better education, better
housing, cheaper food, increased
facilities for travelling, shorter
hours of work and higher wages—
these things have all helped to
improve the condition of the people;
a great result may be achieved.
Nevertheless, to effect this result
is no easy matter. Where there is
no will, there is no way. How, then,
is it possible to raise ourselves
above our present level? Direct
legislation, such as prevention or
restriction of certain marriages, is
at the present time impossible, even
if it could ever be resorted to. Such

to robust dairy maids or professors
to schoolmistresses; nor is it in any
sense a class movement. Its aim is
a broad one—to promote the good
of the community as a whole by
encouraging the desirable and by
discouraging the undesirable. The
aim of Eugenics is to encourage the
healthy, thoughtful hardworking
and thrifty, and at the same time to
discourage the diseased, feckless,
indolent and thriftless—or at any
rate to discourage them from
reproducing their kind.
Unfortunately, the effect of
modern legislation is often to
reverse the process. Imbeciles and
other degenerates are kept alive in
an artificial manner, and habitual
idlers are encouraged by the
careless distribution of doles,
whereas the thrifty and industrious
are well-nigh crushed out of
existence under the burden of
taxation. A thoughtful working man
does not have a family larger than
he is reasonably able to support;
but, the unconscientious are
influenced by no considerations of
this kind, and produce a generous
supply of their degenerate children.
These children, who ought never to
have been born, are provided for by
the State, and paid for by those who
are obliged to limit their families to
do so. In many cases those who
have a sense of responsibility are
unable to marry until late in life,
and, even if they do eventually
marry, they are only able to bring
up a small family.
Much harm is also done by
misplaced charity. Not only is it a
direct evil in that it encourages the
undesirable, but at the same time it
diverts much of the help which
might have beenfitted a deserving
case. The support of the aged or
infirm is one of the dictates of
humanity; other forms of charity
are uselss, except as a temporary
measure to assist the individual to
work out his own salvation. Any
help, which enables a man to tide
over a time of difficulty such as
illness or trade depression, is a
useful measure; but money given to
wastrels is worse than money
thrown into the sea, because it
encourages them to breed.
but, excellent as these
improvements are within reasonable
proportions, they can in their
present form have only an indirect
effect on the future.
Eugenics has proved that
(contrary to the view held by some
people) men are far from being born
equal either in physical or in mental
characteristics; and further, that the
relative value of nature is far greater
than that of nurture. There is a limit
to the powers of development of any
individual and, short of the best
possible training, this limit or
capacity, as it is called, can never
be reached. The best education,
therefore, can do no more than
develop to the full capacity of
knowledge of the individual; it can
never make a wise man out of a
fool.
The powers of the individual,
then, are limited from the moment
•of his conception; but, to the
capacity of generations yet unborn
there is no such limit. We should
aim, then, at improving the capacity
of future generations. Let each
generation start in life a little in
advance of the preceding one, and
action would interfere with the
liberty of the individual, and could
not for a moment be"tolerated. It
would be undesirable from almost
every point of view. Even granting
that legislation would be justifiable
in certain extreme cases, hereditary
diseases for example, the difficulty
arises or where a distinction is to
be drawn. What man can claim that
he has a right to decide who shall
or who shall not exist?
On the other hand many questions
of this kind are determined by
natural laws, which will operate of
themselves as civilisation
progresses, if only they are allowed
to do so. In a natural state the
healthy, strong and hard-working
tend to survive at the expense of the
weaker members of the community.
Unfortunately, the modern
tendency is to interfere with these
laws in the worst possible way—to
burden the strong with the support
of the weak and indolent. As an
American writer has said: 'The
world is full of willing people; one
half is willing to work, the other is
willing to let them.' If the latter are
supported by the former, this is no
doubt true; but, it may be supposed
that, goaded by necessity, many of
the second class would work also.
The conditions under which these
people find themselves will
determine whether they are to be
wastrels or good citizens. Ignorance
is one of the chief sources of evil;
and some knowledge of these
questions should, therefore, form a
part of our education. Even the
most thoughtless, if only they were
made to realise the full consequence
of their own actions, might hesitate
to bring into the world children,
doomed to die prematurely or to
suffer for a life-time, the victims of
an hereditary taint.
In conclusion, let it be urged that
no harm ever comes to
straightforward discussion; and for
us one and all to realise that in this
question lies a problem of vital
importance to the race of the future
is to go a long way towards solving
that problem. What kind of people
are going to follow us in the world?
Are we to hand on our great
heritage to an enfeebled and
degenerate race or to beings nobler
than ourselves?
