8 May 1992 Felix 933 Letters
Pervert Examination Leaked
Dear Adam.
I would like to complain about the
insiduous comments concerning my
love life in your column this week.
I refer of course to the odds of 7:6
given to yourself. 'Wishful
thinking' say I! We all know who
you are, you sneaky, perverted,
excuse for a Felix Editor, I find it
appalling that your paper should
sink to these levels to fill its pages.
Yours disgustedly,
Rachel Mountford, Civ Eng 2.
Dear Adam.
The following point has come to
our attention and we write on behalf
of a number of colleagues.
On Tuesday 28 April 1992 a
considerable number of students sat
the Accounting and Finance exam.
This is a humanities option run by
the management school and taken
by:
Mech Eng, Chem Eng, Elec Eng,
Physics and Materials Science
second, third and fourth year
students.
The paper was a direct (actually
word for word) copy of the 1987
paper. Unknown to the
Management School, the paper was
available in the Mech Eng library.
Officially only the 1991 paper
and worked solutions were
available; however some students
had access to at least the '87, '88,
'89 papers and official worked
solutions. This is an 'open book'
exam, which meant that some
students were able to copy the
solutions directly from their notes.
The course is lectured and exams
set by the Management School.
An examination is designed to be
a fair test of a student's ability, and
in this case it was not. We await
further action to be taken by
College.
Yours sincerely.
Names withheld by request.

union. This is despite our sources
(different ones this time) telling us
that the Deputy President was
mandated by Bar and Catering
Committee to write to us about the
story. However, I can report
progress. We have established new
links with the union, and they are
now talking to us. This is most
welcome. They have now realised
that it is only by a freer flow of
information that college media are
to get their stories right first time,
and that it is not enough for the
union to leave us guessing, and then
complain if we, infrequently, get it
wrong. We welcome our re-
admission to civilisation.
One final point. It must be
pointed out, for the benefit of those
who have not grasped this basic
point, that the Felix article, dated
18 March 1992, was in no way
inaccurate. The article began, T C
Radio reported on 6th March,' and
then repeated the above transcript.
It is not in doubt that IC Radio
broadcast the above transcribed
section. To suggest otherwise
smacks of illiteracy. O K , Zoe?
My apologies for boring you,
though I hope I have been obscure
enough. As per usual.
Kind regards. Many pleasures in
your retirement.

News Editor. Imperial College
Radio.
Dear Sir.
As a former contributor to your
magazine, and fellow student
newspaper editor, I must complain
in the strongest possible terms about
the behaviour of your so-called
music editor, 'Poddy' at the recent
'London Student' party. The
constant expression of his extreme
right wing views caused the
attendees from Queen Mary and
Westfield College much distress, as
they pride themselves on their
politically correct views. While
such people as 'Poddy' have a right
to their views, to thrust them
unwanted on others is inexcusable.
While on the subject of
inexcusable thrusting, the advances
he made on every single female
from Q M W , were frankly, sexist
and bordered on sexual harrasment,
and left several of them extremely
distressed.
I hope you will take the action
you feel is appropriate.
Yours faithfully,
Adam Tinworth, Cub Editor
1991-92, Felix reviews editor
89-91, aka Pendragon.
Revolting Vandalism
Dear Adam,
Malaysian Society's notices,
including a Malay New Year card
for the Malay students, pinched on
a high-quality, multi-colour A l
poster on the noticeboard along the
walkway was all found disappeared
this afternoon, 1st May.
Immediately I contacted Steve
Farrant, the Hon Sec (Events), who
later promised to bring up the
motion in the E G M next
Wednesday.
For years, Malaysian Society has
been using section No. 13 on the
noticeboard, (honestly) not knowing
that its bona fide space is in fact
section No. 8. Such examples are
not scarce. Section No. 8, as in our
case, has been occupied by the
Chinese Society for a considerable
period of time. Moreover, there are
always 40-50% of empty spaces
around at any one time, to say the
least. It is therefore highly unlikely
that any society/club will resort to
claim the space at this very
moment, except the motive to
sabotage.
This act of malice is particularly
damaging as the Sunday's
celebration (3rd May) is the first
major event organised by the new
committee, making the task to
notify its members in 72 hours a
nigh impossible task. Should the
poster be removed at an earlier
stage, the event would be wholly
disastrous, especially when guests
from three societies and the Union
are invited. Therefore to act so
outrageously without scruple and to
ignore the consequences is indeed
disgraceful and revolting.
A space on the noticeboard
enables a society to be in intimate
contact with, not only its members,
but indeed everyone in the College
community. Whatever the motive
behind such irresponsible and
immature act, is inexcusable.
Contemptuous act of vandalism like
such, with strong elements of
wanton destruction, is highly
regrettable and should be subjected
to condemnation.
Yours sincerely,
H.M. Kho, ICMS Secretary.
