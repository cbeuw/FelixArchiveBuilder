minutes later to a much more
mellow sound, relatively speaking.
1 find it very hard to form any sort
of opinion on a group when you
can't hear what they're saying or
what they're playing.
Next up are Wonky Alice who
must be the coooooolest group
around at the moment. They always
remind me of Mission Impossible.
The twang of guitars, the super cool
bass and a groove that could move
the stiffs. Strangely I seem to be the
only one here who thinks this
amongst the couple of hundred
people standing and sitting (?) here.
What is wrong with these people?
So you have to be able to dance to
dance to this, none of this flailing
arms and legs, knocking people
over somehow doesn't appeal. They
play stuff from their 'Insects and
Astronauts' ep; a track like
'Caterpillars' is a masterpiece of
cool, a moment of indulgence and
excess.
Sweet Jesus are certainly a here
and now band, but will they still be
here is six months time? They have
flair and passion that make them
almost uniformly instantly likable.
But what has he got on his head?
Personal sensibilities aside they are
remarkably good in a sort of
energetic way.
Now what can I say about
Revolver that hasn't been said
before? Not much, the new material
is a bit of a departure, a bit slower
and also slightly less adventurous.
That is their problem. Before, when
they were a sort of black sheep of
the family they played around, had
fun and in the process gave us fun.
Perhaps they were just finding their
feet again. I hope so.
Remember, Wonky Alice are
tooooooooo cooooooool.

Sisters of Mercy
Tell me not here, but is this the sum
of my life? Is His Hideousness so
substantial, or am I so insubstantial,
so paper-thin, that this monologue
is the one blooming flower (or
mushroom) in an otherwise
featureless desert? It is, if nothing
else, a return to Forster's Marabar
Caves, Tolkien's Mount Doom,
Dante's Ninth Circle, or, your
average adolescent neuroses. The
villains always seem harder and
more vicious the second time
around.
Decent of them, wasn't it. Sisters
of Mercy, eh? After the Leonard
Cohen song about prostitutes? An
ironic metaphor for a rock band,
you say? Sounds great. Eldritch,
Marx, Gunn, Adams... who's this
Doktor Avalanche bloke, then? A
f**kin' drum machine?! Oh, more
irony, eh? My favourite band.
Ever. Evereverevereverwheeee....
No Ofra Haza. The original
assassin, instead, delivering death
with faultless timing. 'Too much
contact, no more feeling',
'Mundane by day, inane at night',
'Romance and assassination give
me the love for the genocide'. Burn
Me a fire in the Reptile House, in
the colour and the carnage fall me
down. This is Andrew Eldritch, a
black spider, Richard III; 'Let us
to't. pell mell! if not to heaven, then
hand in hand to hell.'
This collage, in varying shades of
black, is not so much three
formative years, but an eternity of
personal damage with desperate,
almost restoration-like asides to
showcase a sense of humour.
Maybe. Share the joke, wear
black, wear shades; ask the other
goths 'were you there?' Turn it into
a rank and odious vehicle for 'fans',
tribalists and sorry refugees. Do me
a favour. This is a soundtrack to my
sudorific and sleepless nights, when
amphetamines and hate were my
•only inspiration, and life could go
hang itself so long as I had a girl
to be miserable over. It's now
again, and much more than before.

Katydids
-Shangri-La
The Katydids. Sounds like an indie,
shoegazer band. They're not.
They're a vaguely Pretenders,
River City People sort of major
label band, and the lead singer,
Susie Hug (!), has an exquisite
voice.
The album opens with a trio of
fine songs, 'The Boy Who's Never
Found', from which the album's
title comes, 'Almost and Nearly',
and 'Slip Away". Then they too slip
away, into a less catchy middle
section of the album, and then, just
when you think they've lost it, they
return with two more splendid
tracks towards the end, 'Always'
and 'What's The Matter Here.'

Barking Mad
I'm going to be brief, as I am in the
throes of exam stress, so... I am
told, by Koenig von Hamburg, that
the Popinjays once supported the
Fatimu Mansions. Tonight
however, they headline at the
Powerhaus, promoting their brand
new 'powerpop' single, 'Monster
Mouth', which is rather
dangerously good.
Saturday brings your cheapest
chance to get into the Brixton
Academy, when Fugazi, and
asssorted other hardcore ( noise to
your mothers ) bands take the stage.
Should be a bit of an experience.
Sunday, and it's Saint Etienne,
who play at the Fridge, such is the
madly spinning world of pop?
Monday brings, at long last, the
best gig of the month so far, by far,
in the incomparable form of My
Life Story. If you miss this you'll
regret it. Seriously.
