The Truth About St Mary's
Dear Editor,
I fear that Ms Mountford's letter
of 18th March was written from a
position of ignorance, and I can
therefore not criticise her for
making so many factual errors.
However, I do feel that it is
important for someone who has at
least some knowledge of the
situation surrounding the merger to
put the record straight.
It is right that we are a C C U of
IC Union. However, it is not upon
the same terms as the other CCUs.
We have financial and political
autonomy—we do not have to apply
to U F C for money to fund our 45
clubs, and nor do we have to adopt
policy that is passed at a U G M . The
reasons for this autonomy are
complex. The timing and location
of UGM's make attendance at them
impossible for any Mary's student,
as was discussed in detail three
years ago (when, I suspect, Ms
Mountford was taking her
GCSE's), when there was a move
to abolish UGMs since they were
deemed to be undemocratic, as it
was impossible for 500 of IC
Union's members (the Mary's
students) to attend. This move was,
sadly, defeated by the regime of
Nigel Baker (a name that few may
remember, but that even fewer
might want to remember!). All of
the efforts which have ensued since
then have not been to drive a wedge
between ICU and SMHMS SU, but
rather, to open pathways of
communication, so that those who
wish to interact from each side of
the park are able to, but that nothing
is forced. It was originally assumed
by ICU that we would enter on the
same terms as the other CCUs. We
made sure that this was not to be the
case—by losing separate finance
and policy making, St Mary's
would lose its autonomy, and all
that is special to the institution. The
wise people of ICU Exec who
followed the Baker regime
recognised that it is far better to
create the opportunity for
interaction, rather than taking away
what we had and forcing us to the
terms of ICU. And, since we signed
the merger document in 1990, the
partnership has grown—and that is
an extremely healthy thing to occur.
ICU and S M H M S SU have taken
an interest in each other, helping
each other out (both ICU helping
us, and at least when I was on St
Mary's Union, us helping ICU) and
forging friendships, which is what
the merger should all be about.
Hence, when I see a letter like Ms
Mountford's, it makes my blood
boil—to make a statement such as
'without IC Union, St Mary's
would not exist' is not only
ludicrous and downright untrue, but
it just goes to promote the 'and IC
feeling' which initially existed at St
Mary's and which, over recent
years, has tended to die. The
reasons for the merger are
extremely complex, and I would not
presume to try to explain them.
However, to suggest that IC 'saved'
St Mary's from being thrown on the
scrap heap is, I suspect, only a
partial truth, if at all. The survival
of St Mary's Hospital Medical
School depends, primarily, on the
existence of St Mary's Hospital,
and its satellite hospitals, and the
maintenance of enough patients to
teach 300 clinical students. IC has
no control, whatsoever, over St
Mary's Hospital, and I am sure that
the first London Medical School
that is cut will be one that is
connected to a hospital which is
short of patients. Suggesting that
Mary's would have died if IC
hadn't rushed to save us is, I
suspect, untrue.
So why did I ask the question
about Ben Turner, complaining that
the candidates took no interest in
Mary's. Those candidates will be
representing the views of IC
students, including 500 medical
students, to many University and
College Committees which St
Mary's do not have representation
on. For example, upon the merger,
we lost our representation on
Senate, and we are now represented
by a member of ICU. How can they
expect to represent the views of IC
as a whole if they have completely
ignored 500 of the students which
they represent. Similarly, St Mary's
has no representative on Governing
Body, so how can someone who has
never even been to St Mary's hope
to say what our opinion on a matter
might be. I would agree that some
of the candidates were given a
grilling—I beleive that a hustings is
meant to push the candidates, and
if they couldn't stand up to the
questioning that I gave them, I do
not want them representing me.
As someone who was involved in
many of the intricate discussions
surrounding the merger, who
helped to write the merger
document, and who played a very
major part in the year following the
merger, I feel that I have the right
to grill the candidates, and to find
out what their plans for IC and
Mary's are. I also have the right to
be upset that the candidates know
little, and seemed to care less, about
the 500 students that they wished to
represent.
The elections made me sad, as
has Ms Mountford's letter. It is
very difficult to take steps forwards
in the partnership between IC and
Mary's, and extremely easy to take
steps backward. I fear that the
elections and the correspondence
have done little to move forwards,
and probably a great deal to move
back. I hope that both ICU and
SMHMS SU will continue moving
forwards, creating opportunities for
interaction, and creating
friendships. I wish them both
luck—we are in this merger
together, let's not start the fighting
again, but move forwards arm in
arm!

The Truth About the Union Bar
• D i d you know that the Union Bar's full name
Dear Adam,
On Friday 06 March, IC Radio
broadcast a story about the
resignation of Ramesh Patel from
the Union Bar and Ramesh's
replacement by Gervaise Loraine,
fondly known as Jarv.
My radar like hearing items tell
me that some union bods are
bitching about this story. This story
you know well - it was printed in
the / C N N Spring News Review.
For those of short memory, or no
reference files, I append the
transcript of the ICR story -
Gervaise Loraine, better known
as Jarv, has won the position of
assistant bar manager after Ramesh
Patel resigned his post earlier this
year. Mr Loraine was appointed
above 70 other people after the post
was advertised in the national
media. This now leaves the post of
bar steward wide open, and the cost
of advertising another post in the
union bar has yet to be mentioned
by sabbaticals, one of whom said,
'Jarv was far and away the best
candidate for the post.' This claim
has been widely rejected by students
and staff in the students' union, who
appear to be upset that Mr Loraine
has been appointed. It has been
reported that Mr Patel resigned
after being forced to by in-fighting.
As union staff have no right to
speak under a student union staff
protocol, they were unable to
comment.
Now, whilst I know that some
union people are complaining, I
don't know what they are
complaining about. Why? Simple -
they haven't bothered to tell me. As
per usual, they have relied on the
whispering winds to convey
information downstairs. (Let me be
helpful: Felix - phone 3515, 8672;
IC Radio - phone 8710; STOIC -
3518).
On this basis, I have been left to
guess as to the offending passage.
My dog Watson tells me that it is
as follows:
This claim has been widely
rejected by students and staff in the
students' union who appear to be
upset that Mr. Loraine has been
appointed.
At the time we broadcast this
report, this was true and accurate,
as it was based on the only
information that was to hand. Also,
this part of the story 'broke', or
became public, on a Friday
evening.
This left two choices; broadcast
and be damned, or hold it and then
check. At the time, it looked good,
and the source seemed solid. So we
broadcast.
We were wrong, we got it wrong,
the story was wrong. After
checking, we could not verify our
interpretation of this phrase.
Therefore, we withdraw the phrase,
with all appropriate regret and
apologies to Ramesh, and to Jarv.
Strangely enough, we still have
not received any complaint from the
