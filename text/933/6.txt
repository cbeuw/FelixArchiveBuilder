How did
Imperial College
Union come into
being? This
article, from
June 1932,
describes the
early Union.
The Veil is Lifted. The public
can now see, for the first time,
how "The Phoenix' is produced.
When the next Academic year
opens in October, the Imperial
College Union celebrates its twenty-
first birthday. It was open actually
at the beginning of the October
Term 1911, though the formal
opening by Sir Thomas Holland did
not take place until November 3rd.
As neither ale nor port (1911 was
not a good vintage year) were laid
down at its birth, it may be
propitious to anticipate the coming
of age with a brief account of its
origin and development during the
twenty-one years of existence.
the opening coincided very nearly
with the incorporation of the three
colleges—the Royal College of
Science, the Royal College of
Mines, and the City and Guilds
(Engineering) College—in the
Imperial College of Science and
Technology.
The proposal to establish, the'
Union was put before the
Governors by Sir Arthur Acland
who may justly be called its father.
He took the greatest interest in it
through all the stages of its erection,
equipment and development, and
throughout had the support of Lord
Crewe, who was then Chairman of
the Governors. The idea which the
Governors had in mind was to
provide for the students of the three
Colleges a Club very much on the
lines of the Unions at Oxford and
Cambridge, which was to be a
meeting place for present and past
students and a means of fostering
and developing the traditions of the
three colleges.
At this point it may be interesting
to give a survey of the
accommodation and the uses to
which the various rooms were put.
On the ground floor on the Prince
Consort Road level, were a Dining
Room and a Reading Room
separated by an Entrance Hall. At
one end were Committee rooms and
a Reading Room for women
students; at the other end a very
meagre kitchen and service
accommodation, with the
Secretary's Office off the main
Entrance Hall. Upstairs and on the
Albert Hall level was another
Entrance Hall dividing a Library
