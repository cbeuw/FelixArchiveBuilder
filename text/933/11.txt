Taking
Fed up with
congested
European
Railways ?
Try the USA.
John Pitt
explains how
You won't travel far by train on
the Continent without stumbling
over an 'inter-railer'. armed with a
lethal backpack and bleary-eyed
from seeing 20 countries in a
month. It's exhausting but it has to
be done. In recent years many
European veterans have found
there's an even more exciting
frontier to conquer before settling
down to a life of chartered
accountancy.
During the 19th Century the USA
was opened up by its pioneer
railroads, and trains still sound a
long, mournful horn as they round
the bend at midnight. This may not
be the fastest way to travel but it
gives you plenty of time to relax,
meet new people and broaden your
horizons. Americans generally like
to talk and on trains they'll tell you
their life story in hair-raising detail.
I've travelled more than 50,000
miles by train throughout North
America and found it easily the
most comfortable and trouble-free
way to see the country. Many
places visited by train can't be
visited any other way, and
schedules are arranged so that you
pass through the best scenery by
day. Long-distance trains have
sleek, double-decked coaches with
large-windowed lounge and
observation cars. You get a smooth
ride, lots of space and exuberant
personnel who think they're
auditioning for a 1930s movie.
Dining car meals are good value,
or you can bring your own food on
board.
Another way to economise is to
spend as many nights on board as
possible, arriving at your
destination early in the morning
ready for a day's sightseeing.
Getting a good night's sleep is
surprisingly easy, given the big
reclining seats and a free pillow
from the attendant. You should take
a blanket or coat with you, though,
because the air conditioning is
sometimes over-enthusiastic. Most
over-night trains also incorporate
designated sleeping cars, but the
bedrooms are small and you have
to pay extra.
In 1971, the federal government
set up Amtrak to take over rail
passenger services, which had
almost been written off thanks to the
airlines and automobile culture. The
last twenty years has seen a
transformation, with new routes
opened up and more people
rediscovering the pleasures of rail
travel. Among Amtrak's
refurbished stations is a wonderfully
ornate building in Washington DC,
where dozens of shops and
restuarants augment the multi-
screen cinema. Chicago's Union
station boasts a marble and brass
waiting room the size of a cathedral
(as seen in Brian de Palma's 'The
Untouchables').
Besides being romantic and
ecologically sound, US trains are
one of the World's great travel
bargains. A forty-five day
Nationwide Pass offers more than
500 destinations in 46 states for
about £ 4 a day - that's $299 (£167)
in low season and $349 in high
season (mid-May to mid-
September). With a Far Western
Pass you can travel in all the Pacific
States as well as across the Rocky
Mountains to Colorado, Montana
and New Mexico for $189 (£110).
Other 45-day passes cover the
Eastern USA, the West and Florida
(only £39).
One of the most spectacular trains
you can ride is the Coast Starlight,
running between Seattle, near the
Canadian border, and Los Angeles.
California. As well as briliant green
forests and 10,000 foot mountains,
you will see Puget Sound and many
miles of Pacific beaches, where you
might be lucky enough to spot
migrating whales off shore. San
Francisco is a fast bus ride across
the bay from Oakland.
Other recommended trains
include the Southwest Chief (taking
in the Grand Canyon), the Crescent
(New York to New Orleans via the
deep South) and the Maple Leaf (for
Niagara Falls and Toronto in
Canada). The Desert Wind goes to
Chicago from Los Angeles via the
Rocky Mountains and Las Vegas,
where the station is actually inside
the Union Plaza Hotel. You step
directly from the train into an
inferno of slot machines and
gamblers.
It is not possible to travel coast
to coast on a single train, but there
are several ways of crossing the
country which involve just one
change. You could leave New York
on the Lake Shore Limited, for
example and travel beside the
Hudson River (views of Sing Sing
Jail and West Point) to Albany, then
follow the Erie Canal to Lake Erie
and Cleveland. At Chicago you
have an hour or so wait before
boarding the Empire Builder, which
accompanies the Mississippi and
Missouri rivers through farmland
before crossing 700 miles of North
Dakota and Montana plains. The
snow covered Rocky Mountains are
crossed via Glacier National Park
before your journey ends in Seattle.
This trip takes about 2'A days in
all. Other trans-continental routes
can easily be worked out with the
aid of the free timetable guide, but
note that in some cities Amtrak uses
more than one station. The
