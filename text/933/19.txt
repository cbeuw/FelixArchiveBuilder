Goodbye George
Let Off
Provisional Easter letting figures
were this week leaked from the
Accommodation and Conference
Office. The figures show that, on
average, 30% of Prince's Gardens'
Halls of Residence rooms were
occupied by conference visitors
during the vacation. The figures
also show that at peak periods, 80%
of hall places were occupied by
conference guests.
In addition to conference visitors,
Prince's Gardens' rooms were
occupied by postgraduate students
who were allowed to remain in their
rooms over the vacation. Beit Hall
residents were also moved to
Prince's Gardens to allow
maintenance to be carried out in the
New Hostel.
Moved
Out
Sixty postgraduate students were
moved out of Beit Hall over the
Easter vacation to allow the Estates
Division of IC to remove asbestos
from the Hall. The students were
notified on 25 March that they had
to move into Southside on 10 April.
They were moved back nine days
later.
The asbestos was 'believed' to
have been in the ceilings of
corridors in the New Hostel of Beit
Hall, though Felix was not able to
confirm this as both Gordon
Marshall, Director of Estates, and
Sheelagh Crampton, Residences
Manager, were in a meeting. -
Shit
A number of rooms in Tizard Hall
were flooded with sewage over the
Easter vacation. Andy Jenkins,
Tizard assistant subwarden, told
Felix that a blockage had caused
showers, toilets, sinks and baths to
till with sewage from the rooms and
toilets above. Eventually the excess
water shorted out a three phase
power supply in the bowels of the
building, which cut the supply to a
number of buildings in Prince's
Gardens. The residents of the
affected rooms were evacuated and
the rooms disinfected. Mr Jenkins
said that the residents had been
asked to keep an eye on their health.
Aye Aye Win, the President of the
University of London Students'
Union, has sent a letter to American
President George Bush saying that
she was 'horrified' about the
acquittal of four policemen involved
in the beating of Rodney King,
which sparked the recent Los
Angeles riots. In the letter she
There was a five per cent turnout
in the sabbatical election for
Honorary Secretary (Events) this
week. On the first count, the voting
was as follows - Toby Jones 105,
Dominic Wilkinson 150, New
Election 51 and spoiled papers 4.
Since Mr Wilkinson's votes were
not above the quota of 155, the new
election votes were redistributed
giving Toby Jones 115 votes and
Dominic Wilkinson 156 votes.
Dominic Wilkinson was ratified as

Internecine warfare between left
wing National Union of Students
(NUS) factions became public this
week. A militant political body,
Left Unity, is threatening legal
action against the NUS executive.
The dispute follows the decision
taken at the recent NUS Spring
Conference to abolish the NUS
Winter Conference. This measure
is one of a series of reforms that
N U S Labour Students have
proposed to further what they see
as democratic reform of NUS.
Speaking to Imperial College News
Network, iCNN, Labour Student
Officer, Tom Franklin, said that the
abolition of Winter Conference
brought three main benefits. He
claimed the abolition of Winter
Conference would save Â£150,000,
that the replacement of Winter
Conference would increase
accountability and that more time
would be available to enact
decisions.
These claims have been
vigorously denied by Left Unity. A
spokesman said that the Labour plan
to replace the Winter Conference
with regional conferences and a
national committee would not only
reduce accountability of the
executive, but was also the least
cost effective method of decision
making.
The dispute has arisen over the
methods employed during the

Meeting (EGM).
The E G M had a poor turnout of
about 40 people, despite it being
held in the Junior Common Room
(JCR). The lack of a public address
system meant that the acting
chairman. Steve Farrant, could not
make himself .heard above the
noise. The meeting was going to
include the election of the remaining
Union posts for next year and also
the proposal of a Third World First
motion. After about 15 minutes,
Jonathan Griffiths, ICU Deputy
President, decided to call quorum.
campaign to abolish Winter
Conference. Left Unity have
claimed that Labour Students
cheated during the vote and still
failed to get the vote passed. They
point to an official NUS document
published after the vote which
refers to a decision being deferred
to a future Winter Conference.
They say this indicates that the
decision to abolish is not valid, and
they further add that the decision to
abolish has not been recognised by
activists throughout the country.
Left Unity also claim mass abuse
of the NUS constitution by Labour
Students. They say that after losing
an abolition vote during the 1991
Winter Conference, Labour
Students effectively closed down the
conference to cobble together a deal
with the League of Jewish Students.
They further allege that at
subsequent conferences Labour
fraudulently claimed the theft of
votes, and accused them of
rearranging ballots in suspicious
circumstances.
This is regarded by N U S
militants as an abuse of democracy
and has prompted them to set up a
'Campaign for Democracy in the
NUS'. The defeated Left Unity
candidate for the NUS presidency,
Janine Booth, said that 'the people
who proposed the Winter
Conference abolition cheated.'

The new college wide swipecard
security system was brought on line
over the Bank Holiday weekend,
with all departments fully on line by
Tuesday. Security sources indicate
that initially there were several
technical problems with the new
system. These included the re-
wiring of fire alarms in some
departments so that the security
locks would be switched off in the
event of fire. As in previous weeks,
several students found themselves
without passes. Passes can be
obtained from Sherfield Room 150.
The introduction of the new
system has been accompanied by a
reduction in security staff numbers.
23 security staff resigned, mostly
from the post room, and they were
replaced by 14 new staff. This
caused delays in the postal delivery
system which were especially
marked on Tuesday morning.
Third year physics students
remain without swipecards this
week. As reported in last week's
Felix, and confirmed by our
security sources, this decision was
taken by the physics department,
after consultation. Mr James Gibb,
Physics Technical Services
Manager, has informed Felix that
special arrangements have been
made to allow 'all students' into the
Blackett laboratory.
Staff
Assault
A member of college staff has been
disciplined following an assault on
Southside Bar Steward, Alan
Larson, on 13 April. Mr Larson
was punched in the chest and face
by the member of staff and by
another staff member who could not
be disciplined as he had resigned
that day.
Other disciplinary hearings are
due concerning Southside Bar. A
group of students are to be taken to
disciplinary after allegations of
assault on college staff who were in
Southside on 19 April. Another
group of students are also to come
before disciplinary committee after
it was alleged that they threatened
Southside Bar Manager. Roger
Pownall.
