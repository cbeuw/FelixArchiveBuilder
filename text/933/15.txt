Basic Instinct
If you liked director Paul
Verhoeven's Robocop and Total
Recall, you will be disappointed by
his new movie Basic Instinct.
Investigating the murder of an aged
rock star, who got butchered with
an ice pick while having an orgasm,
Nick (Michael Douglas) is seduced
by the main suspect, Catherine
(Sharon Stone), who is a bisexual
novelist.
The film tries very hard to be
shocking. It displays what we, the
audience, know to be loose
Californian morals (oh dear),
including bisexuality, lots of
bonking and violence.
The film also tries very hard to
be some other things which it
definitely is not: clever, moody,
thrilling, deep and psychological.
Paul Verhoeven should stay well
clear of anything sexual, sensual
and psychological. The film comes
apart at the seams and is full of tired
cliches. There are some beautiful
women in it though. It's probably
better if you wat^h it with your ears
plugged, although that wouldn't
help the gross sex scenes. The
'basic instinct' is supposed to be the
urge to kill, but the movie tells you
The Alchemist
The story—master leaves home on
travels and leaves servant in charge.
Servant takes advantage of
opportunity and fundamentally
makes a minor fortune by enrolling
the help of two associates, Subtle
and Doll Common. They swindle
money and property from the
masses, from a stupid farmer to a
'sophisticated' treasure searcher. It
must come to an end, and it does—
nearly to the end of Face, the
housekeeper.
The play—fast and farcicle. The
acting (as would be expected) is of
the highest standard and the timing
of entrances and exits is
impeccable. The language is archaic
but you understand more as the play
goes on. The movement of the play
at first seems slow, but the speed
and humour content increase
towards the end, when the comedy
of a fanatical monk, and the monk
in charge trying to gain the most
advantage from Face, Subtle and
Doll whilst failing to control the
fanatical Ananias. The whole thing
turning into complete chaos—just as
the master arrives home
unexpectedly...
A brilliant version of a well
known play, as may be expected
from the RSC. Well known faces
in the cast—Jonathan Hyde as Face,
David Bradley as Subtle and Joanne
Pearce as Doll Common.
Tickets from £ 1 2 . 5 0 at the
Barbican. Well worth going to see.

more about the director's fear of
lesbians. The film is barely worth
discussion. I hated it.

A Smoking
Dot in the
Distance
Bloody hilarious. This book is
almost an autobiography about a
young man growing up. It starts
around the end of the depression
and goes through all the trials and
traumas that everyone suffers
during their lives. These traumas
include watching his father have sex
with the house maid in the garden
shed to having to call an ambulance
when his friend manages to rip his
right testicle off on the gate post.
Mmmmm lovely jubley I hear you
all say. But my final comment(s)
must be, it is the best book I have
read in ages, the writing is perfect
and the language colourful (unlike
this review). Get a copy if you can.
