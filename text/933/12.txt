To anyone it is obvious that the
world is in a mess and that on
account of this mess there is a good
chance that a student, after three
years concentrated engineering or
science, will have nothing to do.
Which is all wrong.
Unemployment is attributed to
world depression which is
considered to be the inevitable
aftermath of the Great War. And
why on earth was there a War?
Why did the British people patiently
and expensively prepare their
armaments, their enormous navy in
all those ominously calm pre-war
years? Were they all mad. all those
millions of 'big navy' voters?
Didn't Norman Angell show in
'The Great Illusion' the futility and
sterility of war by cold reasoned
logic? Thousands read the book, it
was reprinted again and again, and
yet they voted for war blindly
believing they were doing
something for the benefit of their
country. The Daily Mail drummed
out of politics a man who had
expressed an appreciation of
Germany. The paper was not to
blame—the Press lives by pleasing
its readers who presumably derived
patriotic pleasure from this
action—the noble worms. Perhaps
it would be a useful object less if
we look a few of these self blinded
citizens who by now have
developed into respectable people in
their forties and fifties, if we took
perhaps one in a hundred and
painlessly destroyed them. Voting
then might become more intelligent
and youth might command more
respect. But when you start killing
people for their opinions or lack ol
opinions you are becoming
communistic and non-constructive.
For the mistake of the Great War
eleven million paid with their lives.
A ghastly price for any less but has
it been a lesson? 'Now in Britain two
million, in Germany six million, in
America as many, are day by day
rotting in unemployment. Are these
millions any better off than the
eleven million dead? And how
many more weary years must drag
before someone sees light and clears
up the mess, instead of muddling on
year after year in the hope that
things will improve of themselves.
Another tragic mistake now
becoming apparent is the enforced
payment of Reparations by the
defeated powers to who the War
Guild was conveniently attributed.
After eighteen years we learn that
Britain would have taken part in the
Great War even if Belgium had not
been invaded. And Germany has to
borrow money to pay Reparations,
and her finances become unstable;
banks close with repercussions in
Britain which send the pound
sliding...
And then the tariff questions—to
be or not to be. An enormous
number of people voted for tariffs
at the last election. That they will
help, at least temporarily,
agriculture and British industries
which are sorely distressed, is
generally accepted. That they will
hit on the head agriculture and
sorely distressed industries abroad
is not mentioned so often. Yet
tariffs are simply economic
armaments with which trade
markets are captured. Instead of
shooting your enemy you take away
his living. On the day in December
when the duty on glassware came
Mental Strife
into operation, thousands were
thrown out of work in Thuringia,
and there the unemployed must
grow hungry. Snow is alright for
winter sports but it's hell for the
man who can't afford a fire. It is
work either for the British or
foreign workman. Chairty begins at
home but the foreigner needs it
more. Should we buy British or
foreign goods? To complicate the
question one must consider the
maintenance of the standard of
living and the exchange value of the
pound.
Why should we rack our brains
and torture our minds with complex
problems like these? Because if we
let things slide, if we don't trouble
to think of tariffs, and debts, and
disarmament, there will be a charge
blacker than that of the Great War
laid against our generation.
'The time is out of joint—O
curse'd spite
That ever we were borne to set
it right.'
