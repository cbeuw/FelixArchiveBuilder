Feature Felix 933 8 May 1992
One'sfirstimpressions of Tokyo
can be quite shocking - mile after
mile of concrete buildings,
punctuated by spiders' webs of
telegraph poles and electricity
cables. It was 7.30pm and yet the
countless office blocks were still
full of people beavering away.
Clearly, the western perception of
the Japanese being workaholics
must have had some truth to it. The
unbearably high level of humidity
hits you like a brick wall the
moment you set foot outside. It
takes quite a while to get
accustomed to, but there really is no
choice.
was to give us a feel for the daily
routine of the average Japanese
worker. This meant waking up
extra early, trekking under the
burning sun to the train station and
later join a long queue for the
Nissan bus. Not knowing the way
was not a problem - you simply had
to follow the crowds - most of them
were Nissan employees anyway!
A great many workshops were
organised for us, most of them in
English. The language barrier is
probably the greatest difficulty for
a foreigner in Japan, though I was
quite fortunate in that I had taken
the 2-year Japanese course as the
The Nail that Sticks Out

went to Japan to
study how a

workforce and
saw how the
Japanese live
Last year the Japanese car
manufacturer Nissan organised an
essay competition which enabled
myself and 15 other students to
attend the 'Nissan Summer Seminar
1991'. The stated aim of this three
week seminar was 'to offer students
the opportunity to understand
Nissan's corporate philosophy and
Japanese culture by experiencing
Nissan's process of automobile
development in Japan.'
Nissan Motor C o . Ltd,
established in 1933, pioneered the
manufacture of automobiles in
Japan and today it is the fourth
largest automobile manufacturer in
the world. The company has its
Head Office in Tokyo, with seven
manufacturing plants principally in
the greater Tokyo-Yokohama area.
Overseas assembly and
manufacturing plants are located at
24 sites in 21 different countries,
with major operations in the U S A ,
the U K , Mexico and Australia.
Nissan's main Research and
Development centre is located in a
picturesque country setting, just
outside Tokyo. The environment is
very relaxed and tries to breed
inspiration and a feeling of
togetherness within the workforce.
This was to be our base for the next
3 weeks.
One of the aims of the seminar
language option during my first
degree. Those who had no prior
knowledge of the language found it
hard to communicate. Quite
unexpectedly, the Japanese proved
to be very poor at speaking English.
They tend to be embarrassed when
making mistakes, and I often found
it easier to communicate by writing
notes on paper.
There is very strong pressure to
conform in Japanese society, a
tendency which is well illustrated by
an old Japanese saying 'the nail that
sticks out gets hammered down'.
One of the workshops involved a
round table discussion with some
young Nissan engineers. We tried
to see whether there was any truth
to a number of stereotyped western
views of the Japanese employment
system and it was interesting to note
that before answering some of our
more direct questions, such as
'would you have preferred
employment with the more
prestigious Toyota?' the
embarrassed engineer would stare
at the others in the room so as to
ensure that his answer was met with
general approval. Japanese
workers, we discovered, do indeed
work very long hours and feel quite
happy doing so. since it shows
commitment towards the job and the
company but they do not dislike
holidays, as we are led to believe.
At Nissan there is a standard work
uniform, but people are free to
choose whether or not to wear it.
Contrary to popular myth, the
working day does not start with a
group gymnastics session - and
though there are companies in
which this is done, it is certainly not
the rule.
The western habit of changing
jobs still raises eyebrows in Japan.
The Japanese feel honoured that the
company condescends to employ
them, and expect to remain with
their first employers until the
mandatory retirement age. Moving
company for any reason is still
viewed with suspicion, and is often
taken to imply that there is
something wrong with the person
rather than the company.
Women engineers are a rarity in
Japan. On the line management
level, we were told that one in every
5000 workers was a woman but we
were assured that there is currently
a drive to encourage more women
to join the firm. I personally feel
think this may take quite some time.
Women are expected to get married
when in their 20s, sometimes by an
arranged marriage to another
company employee, and so
eventually become a good
housewife who takes care of the
children. Indeed, women who are
still single at the age of 30 are
described as 'Christmas Cake', ie
cake which is not eaten once
Christmas is over.
The main cultural part of the
seminar was a three day trip to the
temples and shrines of the city of
Kyoto. Kyoto is a fair distance from
Tokyo, though this was hardly

noticeable when travelling by
Shinkansen, the famous Bullet
Train. You have to be extremely
quick when boarding the train as the
doors remain open for precisely 20
seconds and no delay is tolerated.
Kyoto has some of the finest shrines
in Japan. Before stepping into any
temple or shrine you are obliged to
remove your shoes - it is therefore
important to ensure that your socks
are not holed or you could be in for
an embarrassing time. Our stay in
Kyoto was made as typically
Japanese as possible - this meant
staying in an inn where the rooms
were surrounded; by sliding.paper
doors and food was served on small
tables by ladies dressed in kimonos,
whilst we sat crasslegged on
cushions. Together with the usual
menu of fish, seafood and tofu
(bean curd) in miso soup, there was
always some sake. At the end of the
first evening, after having had a
slight overdose of sake, we headed
for the city centre dressed in
yukatas (Japanese gowns) and
wearing geta (wooden sandals),
behaving terribly like loud gaijins
(foreigners)!
The closest I got to seeing how
the average Japanese family lives
was when I spent a weekend with
the family of a Nissan worker, this
particular family did not speak a
word of English and I was the first
foreigner they had ever met. They
lived in a relatively large house
together with the rest of their
extended family, not too far away
from the Nissan plant. The house
was built in western style except for
one fafami-style room which was
surrounded by sliding paper doors
and furnished with traditional items
mm
such as an ikebana (flower
arrangement) and a couple of
hanging wall paintings. The main
entrance was neatly arranged with
many bonsai trees. On entering
Japanese homes you usually put on
a pair of pale brown slippers. Extra
slippers are provided for the use of
guests - these are invariably too
small for' foreigners. The slippers
can be used in all of the house
except the toilet, and before going
to the toilet there is another change
of slippers, this time into even tinier
bright red ones. Like most
foreigners, I often forgot to change
back into the pale brown ones on the
way out and was often looked upon
in horror for doing so. When I
asked them what religion they
practised they replied that they were
Buddhists, Shintoists and
Christians. Statistics state that in
Japan there are 101 million
Shintoists, 82 million Buddhists and
1.1 million Christians - a total of
1.5 times Japan's population. The
Japanese feel no contradiction in
holding a wedding ceremony before
the deities of Shinto and a funeral
women who are
still single at 30
are called
'Christmas
Cake' - ie cake
not eaten after
Christmas
service in front of the Buddha.
There are also many Japanese who
observe Christmas.
My homestay family were
extremely kind and friendly -
courtesy is most certainly a way of
life in Japan. I was taken to visit all
the tourist spots and I had a strictly
fish and seafood based menu,
including breakfast with mussel
soup, fried shrimps and the
omnipresent bowl of white rice.
Tokyo is quite an immense city
- one is stunned by the sheer
number of people in it. This
becomes particularly noticeable at
the railway station during rush hour
where it is difficult to avoid the
stampede of people moving in and
out of trains. At several stations
there are special people called
'pushers' whose job it is to push
commuters onto crowded trains to
ensure the doors shut properly.
One curious and popular Japanese
habit is an arcade game called
pachinko. Almost every
neighbourhood will have one
pachinko parlour and sometimes
there are more than one on the same
road. In essence, the game is
vertical pinball where the metal
balls are aimed at targets, and if
successful, the numbers of balls
increases. It is quite a sight
watching scores of people from
every age group and profession
sitting side by side playing this
game endlessly. Since gambling is
illegal in Japan, the prizes obtained
in exchange for your bucket of
metal balls take the form of such
items as tinned fruit. This is a neat
way of sidestepping the rules as
when you have had enough you can
cross the road and sell your tins for
money at a strategically located
street stall.
Sunday on a Tokyo beach was a
memorable experience. When we
arrived there was hardly any place
for us to lay our towels and,
surprisingly, even though the sea
was visibly dirty it was absolutely
packed with people. Swimming
meant that you had to struggle
through the crowds and avoid being
hit by swimmers who were thrown
off course by the massive waves.
The dark silhouette of Mt Fuji could
be seen in the distance and as the
evening drew closer, the sunset
reached a striking intensity of
beauty.
My stay in Japan probably ranks
as the most enjoyable vacation I
have ever spent. If I was to write
a more comprehensive article on
my experiences I am sure that it
would require more space than
Felix could afford. I strongly
recommend anybody with some
interest in Japan to take advantage
of the two year Humanities course
in Japanese and get to learn about
a culture that has far more to offer
than mere Sony Walkmans and
Karaoke bars.
