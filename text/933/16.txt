Angels and Amazons Einstein
Did you know, says the
programme, that; around 1200 B.C.
Assyria passed a law compelling
married women to wear veils; the
custom has survived to modern
times? And, did you know; Bishop
Isidore of Seville insisted that the
touch of a menstruating woman
could prevent fruit from ripening
and cause plants to die? Interesting
huh?
I find it difficult to say what
Angels and Amazons is about. I'm
not quite sure. It's circus-theatre.
So we have juggling, acrobatics,
dancing, mime, singing and
walking on glass! Three Greek
Goddesses, feeling a little bored,
decide to come to earth to play their
way through female artistes of the
past. That's the only thread
throughout and it's hard to describe
how and why I didn't like it.
The cast seemed to take us, the
audience, for granted. They seemed
to think that each and every one of
us were their friends. Hence, they
were a bit too casual, a bit too
giggly at their own mistakes and a
bit too self indulgent. It all ended
with a messy, moist menage-a-trois.
It seems that Ra-Ra Zoo do have
quite a following and if you are
uncomfortable with overt
homosexuality and lesbianism you
should be prepared. Most of the
audience were, and were glad to be,
gay-

Well, what can I say? If you don't
understand relativity in this format,
you never will; quite why anybody
not doing a Physics degree would
want to—in such detail—beats me,
though.
The books is mainly illustrations
and reads more like the 'Beano'
than a textbook; One day all degree
books will be the same. The format
is more user friendly than anything
I've encountered in my course and
even if you don't understand it
you'll enjoy the amusing portrayal
of 'the greatest jew since Jesus'.
At £7.99 it's a wee bit expensive
for a paperback but it's an enjoyable
romp through one of the greatest
intellectual feats of modern science.
So if you feel left out when your
phycisist friends ramble on then buy
it for God's sake.

Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme Henry IV
Lc Bourgeois Gentilhomme is the
latest of the National Theatre's
assaults on Moliere's oeuvres.
Director Richard Jones and his
unfortunate cast have rendered this
gem of a play a total nightmare.
Gentilhomme is a comedy of
manners, charting the rise of the
stupid bourgeois—Monsieur
Jourdain, with grand aspirations.
His forays into education, fashion,
socialising and his ambitions for the
marriage of his daughter are
sparklingly articulated in Moliere's
original, full of wit, refreshing
cynicism and masterly ease of
dialect. Unfortunately, the adaptor
Nick Dear thinks he knows better
than the great playwright and scores
of talented translators over the last
300 years. This insult of an
adaptation is more accurately a
bastardisation of plot and script to
Sun-headline vocabulary and
school-pantomime antics. Timothy
Spall (M. Jourdain) blunders and
pouts out a foul-mouthed moron
rather than Moliere's intended
endearing simpleton. Anita (Ange!)
Dobson (Mme Jourdain) should
stick to singing where her hamming
and screeching would be more apt.
Supporting actors did a brave job
with their tarzan text. Well done to
the set designers 'The Brothers
Quay' for their original and stylish
arena for this fiasco. The question
remains—how can director, adaptor
and actors at the National Theatre,
flagship of British drama, create
and condone an enterprise so
stunningly vulgar, so thoroughly
puerile, so completely embarrassing
and call it art? Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle said, 'mediocrity knows
nothing higher than itself, talent
instantly recognises genius.'
Worrying huh?
The Cookie Monster.
• Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme
opens 5th May at Lyttleton Theatre
on the South Bank, Embankment or
Waterloo tubes, Waterloo BR.
Oh, what's become of the R.S.C.?
Currently running at the Barbican
is their colossal production of H.4.
part one (as they say in the
business). The curtain opens to an
atmospheric and expensive set. It
has all the requirements of an
adequate production; A fat and
funny Falstaff (Robert Stephens), a
dynamic Hotspur (Owen Teale) and
a vibrant, cheeky Hal (Michael
Maloney). These three core
performances were good, but not
great. Julian Glover's performance
as the king was dry and all the court
scenes were airy, dry icy and
benign. The sets are more powerful
than any of the performances and
none of the acting is as strong as the
imagery.
Of course, this is the R.S.C.
(loves) and it's going to be good.
Somehow, I fear, they've lost sight
of the simplicity and directness of
great acting and it seems that the
effort and expenditure of this
production has missed its target. I
would still say that it was worth
seeing. The language and plot are
made accessible and if you can
bring yourself out of the O'level
(oops G.C.S.E.(showing my age!))
approach to Shakespeare you'll
probably decide that he wrote some
damn good stuff. Oh and do buy a
programme, they're very snazzy.
