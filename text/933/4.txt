Editorial Felix 933 8 May 1992
editorial
Many apologies for the 'do-it-
yourself nature of the Felix page
layout this week. To paraphrase
Eric Morecambe, all the pages are
there, though not necessarily in the
right order. Look at it as a puzzle
- the page numbers are all correct,
so with a bit of lateral thinking you
should be able to read everything in
the right order with only a bit of
shuffling. It should make Felix a bit
more interesting to read. Our poor
old printer looks thoroughly
embarrassed by it all.
I wholeheartedly agree with many
of the sentiments expressed in
Simon Smith's letter printed on
page 2. For instance the notion that
St Mary's would not exist if IC had
not ridden to the rescue is somewhat
facile, though I feel a few further
points are worth making. Firstly,
while a spirit of co-operation
between St Mary's and the rest of
the College is to be endorsed, this
will not happen while it is seen by
many students on this side of the
park that St Mary's are a law unto
themselves and while students in St
Mary's see themselves as separate
to the College as a whole. I don't
say that this is fact, merely that it
is perceived as such. It takes two to
be unco-operative, and it is to be
hoped that airing the subject will
help rather than hinder. It is only
when you know what people think
- through letters in Felix, for
instance - that you can take steps to
correct them or debate with them.
Secondly, the Nigel Baker regime
did not defeat the motion to abolish
UGMs. If I remember correctly it
was Mr Baker who attempted to
push the motion through, more to
give rein to his autocratic tendencies
than to help St Mary's in any way.
It was defeated by those students
who bothered to go to the relevant
U G M , who presumably thought
that handing over the Union to the
Executive was even worse than
continuing with UGMs than nobody
has any interest in.
Speaking of UGMs nobody has
any interest in - the E G M last
Thursday was called to ratify the
election of Dominic Wilkinson as
Honorary Secretary (Events), to
elect a new House Committee
Chairman - who has considerable
influence over the fabric of the
Union Building - and to vote on the
Third World First motions which
may have resulted in four major
banks not being allowed to attend
the IC Career's Fair, Fresher's Fair
or to advertise in any Union Media
in protest against third world debt.
Presumably nobody has any interest
in this as the meeting was attended
by virtually nobody.

The world's first ever 'Earth
Summit' begins on the 1st June in
Brazil and is being billed as 'the
most important conference in the
history of humanity.' It will provide
an opportunity for world leaders to
sort out some of today's most
pressing environmental problems
such as global warming,
deforestation and protecting
endangered species.
During the Earth Summit a
special Tree of Life will be
assembled, made up from pledges
in the shape of leaves from people
all around the world. Jonathon
Porritt, director of the Tree of Life
Project said that 'the Tree of Life
serves as a powerful symbol of the
commitment of ordinary people
from all corners of the earth to a
more just and sustainable future.
Your pledge will serve to remind
British and international statesmen,
in the spotlight of the world's press,
that they can no longer afford to
ignore public opinion.'
A pledge leaf has been printed on
this page, for you to complete and
to be sent to the Tree of Life by 3rd
June. Leaves can be also be
obtained from major chain stores,
including the supermarket chains
Sainsbury's, Safeway and Tesco
and from some radio stations.
In order to raise public awareness
of the issues relating to the summit,
One World, a group of broadcasters
is producing a season of
programmes on the global topics of
the environment, development and
world peace. These will be shown
all over the world during May, to
a potential audience of one billion
people. In the U K , the BBC are
planning a six week season of
programmes including
documentaries, films, chat shows
and comedy.
(Imperial College Union, Felix,
or the staff or volunteers of either
do not necessarily countenance the
action encouraged in any part of this
newspaper).
We'll take this card to Brazil
Fill in your personal pledge
and what you expect
governments should
be doing at the
Earth Summit.
PLEASE SEND
