HANGMAN
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
1. American
High School
Ever wanted to be
a jock? How about a
cheerleader? How about a
drama nerd?
Too bad because you’re
just a regular nerd and will
be forever now that the
chance to play out your
fantasies has been torn
away by the cyber morons
up at the Union. First they
run out of money, and
then they run out of fun.
2. 90’s Themed
Here’s an idea that got
tragically kicked to the
curb. Just imagine, you
and your home skillet
crunking down to some fly
beats. “Not!” said scrubs
in the Union “We prefer
getting down and jiggy to
ambient forest noises.”
3. Under the
Sea
Imagined as an exotic
night underwater, sur-
rounded by fish and the
mysteries of the deep,
this one actually made
it quite far along the
decision making process
but everyone chickened
out when the cost of
getting rid of all the water
afterwards came up.
Apparently Thames Water
‘cOmpLAinEd’.
4. Tarts and
Vicars
It was decided that it
wouldn’t be politically
correct at an international
university like Imperial
with such a large and
important public profile.
The risk of showing any
sort of affliation with the
Church was just too high.
5. Pirates
Avast me hearties.
Come and spend the
evening sailing the high
seas with me and me crew.
Always looking to make
the night truly special the
organisers went through
Mogadishu based casting
agencies and even tried
off-shore companies.
Auditions went badly and
the whole scheme was
quietly dropped. Try as
they might the prospective
pirates could never get the
“Arhhhhs” to sound quite
right.
6. Black and
White
A chance to enjoy all
things black and white.
Come dressed in black
and white! Play chess,
checkers, and dominos!
Debate the racial ances-
tory of the ancient Egyp-
tians! Actually maybe it
was a good idea that this
one was dropped.
7. Toga party
All you need for this
one is a bedsheet. And
the thermal insulation of a
blue whale. You and your
Spiderman sheets that you
are ‘only using because
the other ones are in the
wash’ are safe for now.
8. 007 Bond
party
Rehabilitated at last by
the most recent film, the
idea of a guilt free Bond
themed evening seemed
like a real possibility. No
company was willing
to take on the contract
however. All they would
say was that Kinky Club
had emailed them last
year and there had been a
terrible mix up.
9. Neon rave
Always a favourite,
the organisers said that it
wasn’t appropriate to be
endorsing the kind of risk
Wow. Enchanted Forest sure does pop up here quite a lot //Google
taking behaviours that
are associated. Bunch of
losers I say but we don’t
need them. Come to the
Blackett basement, eat
some drugs and have a
wild one with me on the
18th March. 11pm. Be
there or be square.
10. Casio
Roulette, cocktails and
a tragic addiction tearing
families apart, casinos are
full of high class living
and are a fun night out
for all. Not for the Union
however.
Fast approaching dead-
lines and a dyslexic note
taker led to two thousand
pounds being wasted
on calculators and other
electronic goods before
the error was spotted.
