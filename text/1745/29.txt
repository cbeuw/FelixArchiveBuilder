How Dare I?
T
he BBC has re-
cently announced
a documentary
series that will
follow Greta Thunberg’s
‘international crusade’
against climate change,
pointing out the ‘conse-
quences of inaction’. This
new series will certainly
alleviate the pain of the
people rotting in prison
for defaulting on their TV
licence, since they will be
spared the lectures of this
terrible partnership.
The TIME’s Person of
the Year 2019 has indeed
been frightening the
whole world since 2018,
when aged only 15 – and
full of conviction! - she
gave a speech before the
Swedish Parliament. In a
contemporary fashion, she
quickly gained attention,
and almost immediately
became the ultimate icon
for climate activism.
I share with Greta
Thunberg, as with most
citizens of the developed
world, a love of nature,
animals, trees, wind,
rain, sun and sea; forests,
dogs, flowers, dolphins,
and elephants. I even like
rats, unlike most people.
But more important in my
heart than any of these are
humans (as they should be
in everybody’s). Not the
wealthy, but the destitute.
I would therefore like to
explain how I do dare to
steal Greta’s dreams.
First, I must insist on
what I deem ecologism
to be really about. It has
now become a wide-
ly-held belief that our
society is destroying the
planet, that species are
endangered due to human
activities, and that, if we
stay inactive, the planet
will soon be an ocean
of plastic, and the sky a
huge cloud of smoke and
pollution. Therefore, the
only reasonable solution
to this terrible apocalypse
is supposedly economic
degrowth. Indeed, growth
means frantic consump-
tion, which implies frantic
production,whichrequires
an enormous amount of
energy. Producing energy
involves pollution, at
least until the appearance
of a major technological
breakthrough. Therefore,
buying fewer products,
travelling less, walking
instead of driving, or
indeed damaging the
aviation sector could
perhaps save the planet.
Or so ecologists like Greta
Thunberg would have us
believe. I acknowledge
that their rationale is
sound: degrowth would
require less energy and
thus produce less pollu-
tion. Yet they tend to omit
what degrowth would
also take away: teachers,
hospitals, doctors, even
freedom (e.g. of travel).
As a matter of fact,
growth is a sign of how
hopeful we are of what
to expect in the future.
It is therefore absolutely
understandable that those
catastrophists are advo-
cates of degrowth.
However, the political
class is still filled with
members of this evil old
world who brought peace,

better living conditions
and comfort to society.
Who could argue this is
not a result of economic
growth – whose closest
synonym is technological
progress?
Because of ideologists
frightening everybody,
especially the youth, pol-
iticians nowadays all want
to save the planet (yes,
very importantly in green
font). This has become
an irrefutable hypothesis:
the planet is in danger and
our number one priority
is to save it. For instance,
it even became a central
argument of PM Boris
Johnson’s campaign.
“Get Brexit done” in
order to fight climate
change. To achieve this
goal, politicians purport
to be ready for everything
but degrowth. It would
obviously bring discord
and poverty, and nobody
wants to be responsible
for it. That’s why there
are more and more what
we could call green laws,
all around the world (my
own country, France, is a
good example, but the UK
is another), such as laws
to force a decrease in the
consumption of plastic,
taxes on car owners, etc.,
whose only purpose is
to please sanctimonious
voters. But does it please
the ecologist preachers?
No, of course not - they
see it as pure hypocrisy,
and I agree with that view.
Indeed, should our
goal be to save the planet
without considering
human interests, then
obviously we would need
degrowth. I could take
this point even further: we
would need mass suicide,
as all human life pollutes.
Luckily, ecologists
have been proven wrong
several times before. One
of the first, Paul Ehrlich,
wrote in The Population
Bomb (1968) that the
demographic boom would
create famine, epidemic,
and war. According to
him, the only solution
was to initiate a huge
campaign of sterilisation
in some parts of the globe.
A few years later, in 1972,
the Club of Rome pub-
lished a report announc-
ing devastating shortages
due to frantic growth.
While these hard-working
intellectuals were playing
Nostradamus, engineers,
businessmen, doctors,
scientists and politicians
united their efforts to
develop agriculture, as
well as to find ways to
prevent epidemics, and
so on. Thanks to them,
none of these predictions
of apocalypse turned out
to be right. Now, Greta
The true threats of climate change: democracy and capitalism
“degrowth
wouldalsotake
away: teachers,
hospitals,
doctors and
even freedom
(e.g. of travel)”
“capitalism
and democracy
have proved
to be the best
framework for
freedom to
thrive”
Thunberg is obviously the
heir of those who wanted
to sterilise the populations
they judged to be growing
too fast…
Therefore, advocates
of degrowth leave us
no choice but to insist
on that obvious truth:
capitalism and democracy
have proved to be the best
framework for freedom to
thrive and for living con-
ditions to improve. Let us
consider an example that
concerns us all in London:
the river Thames. It is at
its most biodiverse for
centuries! That is certainly
not the result of economic
degrowth forcing people
to work less, earn less,
consume less and have
fewer children. It is indeed
a direct consequence of
the opposite. To clean the
river Thames, solutions
have indeed been found
withinthecapitalistframe-
work, while democracy
has ensured the freedom
of all citizens. Why is
that? Because, unlike
what Greta would have
us believe, the protection
of the environment and
avoiding wasting resourc-
es does not only please
the nature-loving-citizens,
it is also in the companies’
interests.
So, yes, dear Greta, I
will steal your dreams if

misery and illnesses in
dark green forests and
choose instead hospitals,
comfortable housing, and
freedom in increasingly
developed countries, all
around the world.
