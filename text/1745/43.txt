MASTERMIND
Special thanks goes to DoC’s DuncanWhite, who has very kindly developed the code to generate
Mastermind puzzles like these, along with their relevant graphics for us to use!
Instructions:
Try to guess a secret code of colours in a specific order.
A black peg indicates a correct colour in the correct position. Of course, you are not told with
position(s) contain the correct colour, simply how many positions contain the correct colour.
A white peg indicates a misplaced colour - the correct colour but in a different position! A few
guesses have already been given, leadinng to a unique solution!
There are easier variations with more examples at:

Possible colours := {Yellow, Pink, Blue, Green, Red}
