I
t has brought out the
best and worst in soci-
ety, from compassion
to hate speech and
widespread panic. The
societal outcomes of the
virus created economic
uncertainties and losses in
the markets. Let us start
by getting an understand-
ing of the virus, followed
by exploring its economic
impacts.
Background
The novel coronavirus
is part of the family of
Coronaviruses (CoV).
This family includes
diseases such as Middle
East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV)
will be looking at SARS
in 2002 because of the
similarities it shares with
the novel coronavirus.
SARS was discovered
in Guangdong province
in southern China. It has
spread to 26 countries
and has resulted in 774
confirmed deaths. During
this time, the US invaded
Iraq, which would have
influenced the markets as
well. Hence making it dif-
ficult to decouple the two
events and the combined
impacted it had on the
markets. So does this
mean that we should not
use SARS as an indicator?
Impacts of such diseas-
es on markets
Though it was men-
tioned earlier that SARS
could not be easily
decoupled from the Iraq
invasion, it does not
suggest that we should
ignore it. An article by
the Financial Times titled
“Investors look to history
for clues on the market
impact of coronavirus”
briefly discusses the
general impact of the viral
epidemic on the stock
market, which showed
that during SARS, the
MSCI world index was
down by more than five
per cent during that period
before recovering.
What can we then say
about the impacts?
Since 2003, China’s
share in the global Gross
Domestic Product (GDP)
has risen to 18.69%. As
GDP is an indicator of
the value of economic
activity, this may suggest
the impact the virus has
on China will have a
greater influence on the
global markets compared
to SARS.
We have already
witnessed the fall on the
24th
of February where
the Dow, S&P 500 and
Nasdaq Composite Index
each dropped by more
than 3% each.
A report from JP
Morgan Research titled
“WhatIstheGlobalImpact
From the Coronavirus
Outbreak?” mentioned
that Asian airline share
prices took a hit during
2003 but rebounded as
soon as there was greater
confidence in tourism and
goes further to mention
that global air traffic could
be flat in 2020 rather
than seeing a growth.
Additionally, cruise lines
around the world would
see a decline in revenue. A
post by MSCI titled “The
coronavirus epidemic:
Implications for markets”
also highlights similar
sentiments and shows
an increase in revenue
for China’s healthcare
sector and compares how
certain sectors in China
and SevereAcute Respira-
tory Syndrome (SARS-
CoV). Like its family
members, it is transmitted
from animals (zoonotic in
origin) to human beings.
This virus was reported
in December 2019. Its
origins were traced to
Wuhan, the capital of
Central China’s Hubei
province. Since then, the
virus has spread to 33
countries and has resulted
in 80,239 confirmed cases
and 2700 deaths (as of
25/2/2020).
For comparisons, we
performed during the
SARs outbreak as well as
their performence amidst
this current outbreak.
Most notably, the retail
sector has seen a decline
and Chinese consumers,
according to the Financial
Times, accounted for 40
per cent of the €281bn
spent on luxury goods
in 2019. Some luxury
brands with supply chains
reliant on China would
see further impacts on
its revenue, resulting in
a dip that present fund
managers with opportuni-
ties to buy in.
It is worth mentioning
that SARS was contained
within 4 months and it is
highly unlikely that the
novel coronavirus would
be contained within
the same duration after
reports of outbreaks in the
Middle East and Europe.
There is no telling how
long the outbreak will last
and its impact on the stock
market. For some inves-
tors, this might be a time
to sell and cut their losses
while this might be an
opportunity for others to
invest.
Nonetheless, this is a
good example of how re-
al-world scenarios impact
the global markets and it
“there is no
telling how
long the
outbreak
would last
and it’s impact
to the stock
market”
also gives us a glimpse
into the investment psy-
chology of fund managers.
