Dreams. The Ultimate Video Game Creation Tool in
the Palm of Our Hands
O
h boy. How
do I even start
d e s c r i b i n g
D r e a m s ?
Dreams is something truly
unique and ever growing.
It is a video game creation
tool, but also a hub of
endless games that one
can try themselves. It has
a campaign if you want
to get stuck into game-
play – but equally you
can watch music videos,
or the start of movies
recreated by fans at the
click of a button. Dreams
is the ultimate creative
outlet for gamers, whether
well versed in the realm of
creation or not.
When you first open up
the game, you a greeted
by a narrator who guides
you through some basic
mechanics of the game –
including the use of Impy
the imp (effectively the
cursor for the player to
control when playing or
creating games). After
this relatively short intro-
duction to the world of
Dreams (optional) motion
controls, you are given
the choice: Play or Create.
This is the crux of what
Dreams is about: you can
create games for others
around the world, play
games made by others, or
a little bit of both.
While released on
Friday 14th of February,
Dreams has been in early
access for quite some time,
with plenty of passionate,
budding game developers
getting their teeth into
everything the game has
to offer. This was a great
idea for Dreams developer
Media Molecule to have,
as it meant that when
everyone jumped into the
game 2 weeks ago, there
was already a vast array
of content to enjoy.
I began by choosing
to play, so that I could
get some inspiration.
It is recommended that
you play a movie length
campaign created by
Media Molecule called
‘Art’s Dream’. Art’s
Dream is created within
dreams and highlights the
plethora of things that can
be done within the game.
Shifting between 3 main
perspectives, I got to ex-
perience a point and click
adventure, a multiplayer
beat ‘em up and a puzzle
platformer. Interlaced
with the occasional music
“when
surfing the
dreamverse, it
is hard to know
just where to
start”
“someone had
taken the time
to recreate the
first 7 minutes
or so of Star
Wars Episode
IV: A New
Hope”
video and cinematic
cutscene, this 3-hour
campaign felt vibrant,
artistic and extremely
varied. Throughout the
campaign, I picked up
various bubbles contain-
ing objects which can be
used to create my own
game – something that I
will cover later.
When surfing the
dreamverse, it is hard to
know just where to start.
There are so many options
to choose from – but
luckily there is a great
filter system that can filter
by genre, accolade or tags
(e.g. single player, music,
e.t.c.). There is also an
option to shuffle games
and play random ones in
succession for as long as
you like. As there is an
ever-increasing number
of games that vary so
widely in scope, I could
never hope to cover them
all in this article (or any
for that matter). Instead,
I will highlight some of
my favourites. First was a
game created as part of a
wild-west themed creation
event, where dreamers had
a limited time to create a
game based on the wild
west. This game had a
relatively simple premise.
You sit at a piano trying
to press certain buttons in
time with the music. This
became more difficult as
time went on, and if you
messed up you would
be targeted by a bandit.
You have to dodge left
or right to avoid gun fire,
all-the-while remaining
in time with the music.
This beautifully simply
gameplay mixed with
the nail-biting anxiety of
being shot made for over
an hour of fun.
On the complete other
end of the spectrum, I then
stumbled across someone
who had effectively recre-
ated parts of Fallout 4. He
said it took him 9 months
to design the textures,
PipBoy HUD, shooting,
animations and opening
sequence (as well as a
quest chain and various
enemies). I was blown
away by how closely it
resembled Fallout 4, and
with promise of future
updates I promptly added
it to my follow list. One
great aspect of Dreams is
the ability to follow both
creators and their specific
creations, so that you can
see whether a game is
being updated, or whether
the creator has moved
onto creating something
new entirely.
Next, I stumbled
across one creation that
truly showed just how
varied Dreams could be.
Someone had taken the
time to recreate the first 7
minutes or so of Star Wars
Episode IV: A New Hope;
the level of accuracy was
astonishing. It blows
my mind how a random
person has the ability to
develop a movie within
the confines of the creation
tools of a video game – it
really puts Mario Maker
to shame huh.
The creation mode of
Dreams is what makes
it so unique. The possi-
bilities really are endless
– I didn’t actually know
where to start. Despite
the seemingly daunting
task, Media Molecule
have developed a system
that makes getting into
creation very straight-
forward; it may seem
cliché but truly anyone
can create something in
Dreams. I started by using
backgrounds and objects
that were premade in the
game – rocks, bushes,
water… although you can
make your own creations
if you so choose. I slowly
started building up a 3D
platformer where you rise
up in a spiral, fighting
enemies as you go. I then
decided to add some more
challenging platforming.
Dreams has an amazing
tool which allows you to
move an object in real
time, then put it on a loop
to create a crude form of
animation, rather than
having to control some-
thing frame by frame.
With all of this done,
and a button at the end to
complete the level, I had
created my first game – in
under 30 minutes!
I have spent almost
2 weeks in dreams and
still feel as though I
have barely scratched the
surface, but as I play more
and create more a slowly
feel myself become more
and more engrossed into
the ever growing land-
scape of Dreams – whilst
simultaneously having an
immense appreciation for
everyone involved in the
growth of my favourite
medium: video games.
