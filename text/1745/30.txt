UK-EU Trade Deal
to create our own rules and
deals. Ideally, there would
be a new deal with the EU
which is beneficial to both
parties. That’s what is
what all this fuss is about.
We’ll need to have this
deal in place by the end
of the transition period on
31st
December 2020. The
UK is seeking to create
a free trade agreement
(FTA) which aims to
encourage trade between
countries by removing
tariffs and not putting
caps on the amount that
can be traded. However,
some tariffs and quotas
are usually needed to stop
too many cheap exports
damaging a country’s
manufacturers. Even if
the UK and EU managed
to create an FTA, there’d
still be border checks as
it’s not frictionless trade.
This means countries
can still make their own
rules on safety regulations
and standards. Currently
this doesn’t happen as
we’re all under the same
economic zone: the single
marketandcustomsunion.
This single set of rules
also guarantees the free
movement of services,
people and capital.
After leaving the EU,
the UK would then have
the power to create its
own set of rules and no
longer follow those set
by Brussels. The price to
pay for this is having a
few extra border checks.
The UK would like to

set up an agreement that
benefits both us and the
EU to stop trade barriers
coming into effect at the
end of the year. The EU,
however, wants to make
an example out of us so
that none of the other
wealthy countries see that
we’re actually doing fine
without the EU and also
decide to leave.
The UK doesn’t want
to impose tariffs or
quotas. In fact, under a
hard Brexit, where no
trade agreement is set up
and the default agreement
is that of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO), the
UK has already stated that
the majority of imports
will remain tariff free. The
UK could potentially have
zero tariffs on exports
to the EU however they
require that we do not
sell any of our products at
competitively low prices.
Recently there’s been
talks of a Canada style
trade deal. Canada has an
FTA with the EU known
as the Comprehensive
Economic Trade Agree-
ment (CETA) which
means most imported
goods aren’t taxed. There
are only a few quotas on
certain things such as
food and a few customs
checks. Canada also does
not have to pay into the
EU’s budget and so the
drawback of this deal is
the lack of freedom of
movement for people and
capital. This seems like a
reasonable deal for the UK
and EU to set up, right?
Well, the EU did offer this
deal back in 2017 but has
since reneged.
Boris Johnson remains
adamant that there is no
need to accept an FTA if
the conditions were to
agree to the EU rules of
competition, subsidies,
social protection and the
environment. Johnson
also stressed that if they
were not able to agree on
the Canada style agree-
ment then trade would be
based off the WTO rules.
This means that if we
choose to not put tariffs on

the same applies for goods
from every WTO member.
There will be no deals and
a strong likelihood of high
tariffs on exports.
So, it seems that if
the UK and EU cannot
agree on some form of
the EU-Canada deal, then
we’re heading towards a
hard no deal Brexit where
the above rules will apply.
An unfavourable outcome
for everyone.
