S
tudents reacted
with horror and
delight to the news
that anyone under
the age of 40 has virtually
no chance of dying from
corona virus.
Epidemiologists have
declared that probability
of fatality increases with
age with babies being
completely invulnerable
and the aged as vulnerable
as a shortsighted lollypop
lady in front of a CEO late
for a meeting. This has of
course, been of great relief
to the student body, which
has demobilised millions
of T-cells and decreased
its temperature back to
normal levels.
This news caused a
variety of responses with
Feb Senton, first year
DesEng student and noted
anorak enthusiast re-
sponding “This is dreadful
news. I usually depend on
mitigating circumstances
to scrape through the year.
Coronavirus was going to
be my panacea.”
The College staff have
been less composed about
the news, with official
guidelines stating that
anyone with a runny nose
had better ‘stay the fuck
away.’
While it has been dif-
ficult for sources on the
inside of the sealed Blue
Cube to smuggle out in-
formation, the atmosphere
is said to be tense. Senior
proffesors are said to be
limiting physical contact
to only what is strictly
necessary, Vice-Provosts
are alleged to have bar-
ricaded themselves into
their offices and the 400
hundred year old blood-
sucker Alice Ghast has
retreated to her eldritch
sewer lair.
ChristianSoc has
endorsed the emerging
pandemic calling it a
“short-cut to salvation”.
Members of the group
have been seen at ACC
handing out blankets and
cough diffusers to bring
As predicitions of a
geriatric genocide pre-
dominate the newspapers,
Negafelix has capitalised
on the forthcoming by
opening a new estate
agency that aims to pair
first-time student renters
with recently vacated
properties that smell
slightly of wee. This is
expected to be the only
way for students from less
advantaged backgrounds
to attend university. Neg-
afelix is excited to invest
the dividends from this
enterprise in Bonds. So
far we’ve only been able
to afford Roger Moore,
but we’re looking to
acquire Timothy Dalton
as soon as anyone can tell
us where he is.
In light of the new class
divide between those
that do and do-not have
grandparents, the Union
has created the position
of Hasn’t Got The In-
heritance Yet Liberation
Officer to counteract the
harmful divide that threat-
ens to tear apart student
cohesion. Conservative
Society Representative
My MarWan AndDied
was surprised at the need
for such an officer as he
assumed that everyone at
this university was getting
an inheritance. Otherwise,
“how on earth are they
here?”
