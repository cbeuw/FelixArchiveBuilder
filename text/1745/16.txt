The Slow Rush
After The Long Delay - The Slow Rush
“Has it really been that long” were the first words Kevin Parker spoke on Patience, the first single released in the
lead up to The Slow Rush, Tame Impala’s first album in almost five years. The wait is over now, the cat is out of the
bag. It’s time for Felix to give its seminal take. Fasten your seatbelts, girls and boys.

T
ime. One of the
most baffling
and psychedelic
concepts and one
that every single one of us
must deal with. Musings
on the theme have oc-
cupied so many artists.
It comes as a logical
conclusion to a fact that
we all have to deal with:
we’re all slowly running
out of time. How much of
it we have, and what the
possibilities held by this
limited and unquantifiable
reserve are, no one knows.
So much stress is
caused by the impression
that time is closing in on
us. Maybe you didn’t have
a productive day at work,
maybe making dinner took
longer than it should have
and now you can’t go to
the gym or your kids are
screaming, or your stove
is on fire... We each face
our own time-dimension
difficulties. Kevin Parker,
the Tame Impala frontman
and de-facto one-man
band, kicks off The Slow
Rush with a number that
contemplates the value of
routine in a relationship
in the context of passing
time. ‘One More Year’
opens with a questionable
heavily-gated deep male
chorus, which carries
through to the end of the
song, and introduces a
main theme of the album
– doubt.
If we take Kevin’s
personal story arc, it can
be retold in plain terms
as the coming of age
of a confused introvert
figuring out how to fit in
in the world. As he has
become more successful,
cementing his name in
rock history, his outlook
has changed somewhat.
Trying to shed light on
his new life throughout
the LP, he manages to toe
the line between ironic
self-awareness and soppi-
ness successfully for the
most part, while failing
spectacularly in places.
It just so happens that
through the passage of
time, with more and more
things seemingly falling
into place, the things he
is doubting have become
more banal. But have they
really? If past actions are
irreversible, and we have
an ever-growing backlog
of these, do doubts
become less pertinent or
do they just accumulate?
An important breaking
point in the album comes
with the lead single, and
in our opinion one of the
highlights of the album,
‘Borderline’. By looking
at the cover art we con-
stantly encounter surreal-
ist scenes of rooms filled
with sand. Doors lead us
to the outside – more sand,
open sky. Other doors lead
us inside – more doors,
more sand. It is an obvious
allusion to surrealist art,
where doors and windows
had an important role as
a symbol of the break of
continuity between space
and time – often also a
break with reality. “Then
I saw the time // Watched
it speedin’ by like a train”.
This particular line from
‘Borderline’ concretely
ties the focus back to the
theme of time, and the
hourglass-esque land-
scape of the artwork. We
now know that the bor-
derline Kevin has found
himself on is one of dif-
ferent timelines, different
levels of existence. On a
musical level, the song is
one of the better examples
of Kevin’s newfound love
for bongos, featuring a
punchier bass than the
single version, and vocal
effects which complement
the self-doubting ques-
tioning in the bridge and
outro.
The turning point in
the album’s story almost
feels like an epiphany,
and is emphasised by the
follow-up, the dryly-titled
‘Posthumous Forgive-
ness’. The gist of the
song is that Kevin has no
means to confront his late
father (who passed away
during the recording of
Tame Impala’s first album
Innerspeaker) for the lies
he told him growing up.
A child of divorce, his
parents’ splitting must
have been a profound
influence on his outlook
on love, subsequently
shaping the lens through
which we as an audience
peer into his life. The first
four minutes are dark,
brooding, and stretched
to the breaking point,
whereupon the saw lead
nosedives into the bongos,
and an airy melody lifts
the mood – similarly
to ‘Sun’s Coming Up’
from Lonerism. Kevin
stops being accusatory
and instead feels sadness
for not being able to
tell his father about all
the amazing things that
have happened to him. A
change of perspective; the
end of doubt?
The section following
could be called “Kevin
Parker’s self-help
medley”.
