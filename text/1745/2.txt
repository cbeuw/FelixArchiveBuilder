Meet the Candidates!
N
ext Wednes-
day, 4th
M a r c h ,
students of
Imperial College will
get an opportunity to
scrutinise the candidates
for next year's sabbat-
ical positions at Meet
the Candidates. Meet
the Candidates is an
annual debate organised
and hosted by ICTV, IC
Radio and Felix, and
aims to allow you, the
electorate an opportuni-
ty to come face to face
with the people that
want to represent you to
the powers that be, both
in the Union and the col-
lege. If you aren’t sure
who to vote for after
painstakingly combing
through manifestos then
this is the event for you.
The sabbatical roles
that will be taking part
in the debate are the
Felix Editor, the Deputy
President for Education,
the Deputy President
for Welfare, the Deputy
President for Clubs and
Societies, the Deputy
President for Finance and
the Union President. Can-
didates will be given an
allotted amount of time to
outline their manifestos,
before being asked ques-
tions given by the Felix
and IC radio team, as well
as fielding queries from
the audience. The event
will be livestreamed over
Facebook, from the Felix
and Union accounts. If
you can’t be a part of the
physical audience, tune in
online to watch the sabbs
sweat.
The overall aim of
this event is to give the
wannabe sabbs a good
old-fashioned grilling
over their manifesto
proposals for the year to
come and their suitability
for the role with a side of
expert commentary from
Union hacks, prominent
society members and stu-
dents. Come along and be
a part of it all, from 15:00-
18:00 in Metric. It’s your
democracy: hold them to
account.

Vote, Damn You, Vote!
B
efore reading
this mini-ed-
itorial, I sug-
gest reading
the above by my trusty
Deputy Editor, Charlie
Titmuss, in which he
talks about the Meet the
Candidates event next
week. Or, as I like to
think of it, a gladiatoral
battle of words between
candidates for the sab-
batical roles that can
be almost barb-tongued
enough to draw blood.
Negafelix's famed 'Vice
Provost (Bloodsports)'
can almost get off to it,
it's so sharp.
This editorial, I want
to revisit a message I
gave during my lecture
shoutouts last year while
running for this election.
Back then, I believed
fully that nobody voted
here, having not seen the
election turnout results.
Halfway through my cam-
paign, I was enlightened
as to the turnout numbers.
Still, they can be mislead-
ing - voting for one role
counts you as part of the
turnout, which is fine, but
means that a lot of roles
don't get as many votes as
one would like.
So during that cam-
paign, I was doing lecture
shoutouts, and I was less
thinking how to strategi-
cally gain an advantage
over my opponents
and more just trying to
encourage students to
vote for my role, and for
every role. I was earnest,
impassioned, and sincere
as I stood before all of you
and asked you to turn up
and contribute.
See, there are all sorts
of problems with not
voting. I won't delve too
much into the democratic
issues that arise when a
limited segment of the
population bothers to
vote. Brexit is already
the perfect example of
that - regardless of your
perspective, the idea that
a quarter of the popula-
tion actually voting for
something and having
that pass into law, either
way the vote goes, is a
bit problematic. So vote,
because that's the only
way democracy doesn't
crumble before our eyes.
And democracy is broadly
pretty good. Or, rather,
it's not as bad as all the
other ways we've found of
running countries.
I want to talk more
about how it affects you
directly, as a student.
Namely, it shapes literally
everything about your
student experience.
I was a student com-
pletely disconnected from
the Union for most of my
degree - one of those who
slips through the cracks,
doesn't read emails. I
became interested via my
involvement with Felix,
but was still largely igno-
rant until I began this role
in September and found
that I had to learn how
everything worked very
quickly in order to report
on campus events.
What I've seen has
genuinely surprised me.
Student volunteers at the
Union work really hard,
guys.
Now that's not a reason
to vote in itself. It does,
however, segue nicely
into my real point.
Just because you do not
see what the Union does
for you does not mean it
does not affect you. Don't
be jaded.
This year, the Union
has fought hard to reduce
rent for first year students.
They're negotiating the
block grant that directly
funds every single club
and society. They got
the College to imple-
ment ethical investment
policies. They worked
on the Harlington sports
grounds. They pushed the
College to respect NSS
results They took over the
Summer Ball and made
it student-led. Academic
and wellbeing reps have
been there for you every
step of the way, in every
meeting, fighting your
corner where they can.
They did a lot of stuff,
that will genuinely and in-
variably impact you. Your
degree, your finances,
your hobbies. So f*cking
vote for people who'll
keep doing that for you. It
takes just a few seconds.
