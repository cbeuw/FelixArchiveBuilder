Pause, Breathe and Lose yourself in The Habitat of Time on a sleepy Saturday afternoon.
T
wo sounds greet-
ed me as I entered
the tiny gallery,
tucked away in
one of central London’s
many quiet corners:
the faint tapping of the
gallery attendant’s laptop
keyboard and the ghostly
sound of crickets chirp-
ing. Snowy tree crickets,
to be exact, whose pitch
and tempo changed ac-
cording to their ambient
temperature. This audio,
part of Josh Wodak’s seed
in Space/sound in time,
was constructed from
samples of the cricket and
mapped to the changes
in temperature of three
different Wollemi Pine
samples; one in a seed-
bank, one in its natural
habitat in a distant gully,
and one on its lonely jour-
ney to the International
Space Station.
The Habitat of Time
is an exploration of how
we can present time in a
modern context, where
information travels great
distances almost instanta-
neously and a transitory
moment can be captured
and recalled anywhere,
“This is an
intimate
exhibition
whose
composition
makes it easy
to become
absorbed in
its surreal,
disconnected
atmosphere”
at any time, indefinitely.
It is therefore quite
fitting, that the gallery
itself feels suspended in
a bubble, sheltered from
the bustling streets around
King’s Cross.
Visually, the piece that
first caught my attention
was Eva Nolan’s The
Pinned Moth Cannot Fly,
a hypnotic animation
of black-on-white con-
centric circular patterns,
which, upon closer
inspection, unravel into
graphite drawings of
winged insects blending
and intertwining with
flora. As it zooms ever
further inwards, towards
its centre, the intricate
linework that connects
the different species and
kingdoms is revealed. Its
namesake is a reference to
taxonomy and its implica-
tions for how we perceive
the divisions between life
forms across scales of
time. Even without this
context it is still aestheti-
cally mesmerising.
Walking around the
main room of the gallery
I spotted the first piece I
saw on the exhibition’s
website, James Geurts’
Trajectories II: Prebiotica:
a black dot, encompassed
by a blot of brown dye,
with some faint black
lines drawn on top. A very
unassuming piece, to say
the least. But at its heart
lies the oldest known
material on Earth, found
in a meteorite. There
was something humbling
about seeing the traces
of this ancient substance
suspended in a lightbox,
measured, identified and
analysed. Its journey to
Earth took place over an
unfathomably long time
compared to my exist-
ence, past and future, and
yet here it was in front of
me, presently.
But my favourite part of
the exhibition was tucked
away in a dark side room,
with a singular bench at
its center and bean bags
strewn across the floor. On
one side, RobertAndrew’s
Presence in Time evolved
onscreen, with mixtures
of geological materials
and pigments cascading
and producing wonderful
contrasts of red, white
and black - emergent,
unpredictable patterns.
James Geurts’ Ark was
projected onto the other
wall; a grainy, decaying
sample of film footage,
left exposed to the envi-
ronment in which it was
captured. I sat in front of
this film for a very long
time, alone, watching
the flickering images of
foreign hillscapes. In
this fleeting moment, I
was the only person in
the world who could see
those aberrated pictures.
By sacrificing the preci-
sion of photorealism, it
felt like they absorbed
some essence of their
provenance, something
that was a part of them
but which cannot hope to
be captured by a camera
alone.
The Habitat of Time
is an intimate exhibition
whose composition makes
it easy to become absorbed
in its surreal, disconnect-
