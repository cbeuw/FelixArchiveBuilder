Starset - Other Worlds Than These
L
Electronic Hard-
Rock band,
Starset, blast off
back to the UK
on their headline tour
for album number three,
Divisions, and the results
are stellar.
Starset once again blew
crowds away, transporting
audiences to another
world as heavy-metal riffs
were combined with clas-
sical strings and modern
synthesisers.
Fans new and old were
treated to 18 tracks, eight
from the new album
Divisions, four from fan
favourite Vessels, four
from debut Transmis-
sions as well as covers
of ‘Kashmir’ by Led
Zeppelin and ACDC’s
‘Thunderstruck’.
The set opened with
the first single from Di-
visions, ‘MANIFEST’, a
starkly juxtaposing track
with light, pop-like verses
combined with jarring
choruses that make Bring
Me The Horizon look like
aLo-Fipopband.Thiswas
followed immediately by
US chart-topping single,
‘Monster’, complete
with full string intro and
choruses performed by
the band’s resident vio-
linist and cellist, standing
on pedestals towering
over the crowd. All the
performers were shrouded
in wispy, tattered-looking
costumes that thrashed
about amongst the count-
less beams of light as they
played. This was spot on
for the rebels theme with
the “Demonstrations” as
the band are calling per-
formances for the album
Divisions, all about rebel-
lion against a dystopian
society.
This much more ter-
restrial theme continued
through the first half of
the performance, which
was brought to a close by
the hair raising ‘Trials’.
Singer and Guitarists
held flags high as chants
of “These Trials make
us who we are, we’re
motivated by the scars
that we’re made of, we
take our places in the dark
and turn our hearts to the
stars!” echoed around the
2000 person venue.
As the band disap-
peared backstage, and
the crowd took a moment
to catch their breaths,
the audience was treated
to yet another narrative
video played on the stage
backdrop, further elabo-
rating on the dystopian
future in which the band
were playing from. This
was underwritten by the
ominous countdown to
“Demonstration Reboot”.
As the timer hit zero
and lights went down,
human figures drifted
onto stage lit only by
specks of light from their
chest plates and the blue
glow from the space-suit
visors. This throwback
to the iconic outfits worn
for their first two albums
was a sure sign that things
were about to reach
another level, or specifi-
cally, another world.
The set opened up with
the screaming ‘Carni-
vore’, strings in harmony
with headbanging guitars
followed by heavy-metal
favourite ‘Bringing it

even wonders
is a compilation
of psychedelic
soul tunes from
Australia’s underground
scene. Recorded direct
to tape in a series of
live sessions in the heart
of Melbourne, it is an
awe inspiring listen
and fantastic showcase
of Australia’s rising
talents.
Whether drawing on
60s psych-pop, 70s af-
ro-jazz or 00s neo-soul,
the tracks on Seven Won-
ders maintain a distinc-
tively modern approach,
emphasising rhythm
above all else. The re-
sultant kaleidioscopic
grooves are immensely
pleasurable, the Aussie
musicians prooving be-
yond a shred of doubt
that they are on par with
the tidal wave of talent
bursting from London’s
jazz/soul scene, whose
influences they share.
A selection of tracks
here feature vocalists,
whose honey-drenched
melodies and compel-
ling lyrics add a degree
of depth and approach-
ability to what are often
harmonically complex
tracks.
‘Work’ features rap-

a strong performance.

the heist was well ex-

pass.
The compilation’s
Instrumental cuts vary
from verdant sonic
landscapes like ‘Wom-
ans Choir’ by GODTET,
which comes on like an
outake from Pet Sounds,
to grittier tracks with
more rock influences. A
personal highlight and
example of the latter is
‘Dempsey roll’ by Su-
perfeather. Built around
an almost aggressive-
ly oversaturated drum
loop, twin guitars weave
intricate patterns out of
African guitar lines, all
the while descending
into the realms of ato-
nality. The result is a
listen as fascinating as
it is challenging.

on the ground floor hadn’t
broken into a sweat as
mosh pits formed and
the band flew around the
stage. Frontman Dustin
Bates has obviously
spent time working on his
growls as the breakdowns
hit and his voice filled the
room with a power that’s
normally reserved only
for the strongest of metal
vocalists.
A break provided by
lighter track, ‘Telescope’,
was followed up by ex-
perimental track, ‘Other
Worlds Than These’,
with heavily electronic
vox intro and pounding
bass, calling out to those
content living their lives
inside locked minds.
Lyrics “Pull the wool out
from your eyes/ It won’t
shade your frail belief/ In
the end we cannot hide/
There are other worlds
than these” resounding
with those often associat-
ed with fringe music like
this.
Starset closed their
double set with the only
song they could, ‘My
Demons’. A song that on
youtube views has sur-
passed Muse’s ‘Uprising’;
possibly the track which
most embodies the energy
that Starset bring to all
aspects of their music,
be that the spectacle of
their live performances
or the intricacies of their
overarching narrative.
Or perhaps the unique
musical combination
of electronic, hard rock
and classical strings in
a strange summary of
humanity as an ever
growing, ever reaching
species that strives to live
life above just an exist-
ence and aspires to one
day soar among the stars.
