Bottle Match: Men’s Hockey
A
fter some
difficult com-
petition earlier
on the hockey
pitch, it was up to the
boys to put CSM in their
place. Despite the terrible
conditions, we started
well going 1-0 up through
a carefully placed flick
from Nick Yiakoumi at a
penalty corner. Solid de-
fence at a number of CSM
penalty corners, and good
possession meant the lead
stayed at 1-0 going into
the second half. Right
from push back RSM
put the pressure back on
CSM. Matt Kavanagh
working hard to win us
a penalty stroke, calmly
converted by Nik again
to double our lead. Again,
the RSM defence was
solid for majority of the
second half. CSM pulled
one goal back close to the
end, but it was not enough
for them to stop the
Sharpley coming home.
A huge performance from
all the boys involved saw
RSM secure a 2-1 victory!
Big shout out to Lekan for
winning man of the match
(voted by CSM). It’s all
about the hockey!

Bottle Match: Netball
W
ell here we
are. After
a shocking
defeat of
88-2 last year we thought
it wouldn’t get any worse.
We thought it couldn’t be
done. But we did it.
After a rocky start with
half of our members not
being allowed to play and
having to draft in spec-
tators to make up a team
(shoutout to player of the
match Parise Lockwood
who was a) hungover, b)
not meant to be playing
and c) playing in defense,
a position she’d never
played before), the match
was no sooner underway

Didn’t beat CSM, but beat the scoring records// RSM Netball Team
“the match
was no sooner
underway
than we
were getting
absolutely
dicked”
but nothing would stop
our valiant miners from
giving their absolute all.
The effort and determi-
nation of our girls was
amazing, and I couldn’t
be prouder of every single
one of them, especially for
than we were getting abso-
lutely dicked. Despite our
best efforts we were no
match for these beefy girls
and even the scoreboard
couldn’t keep up with
what might be the worst
score difference netball
has ever seen (109-2).
Our girls heroically
pushed on – contact lenses
were lost, bodies were
flying all over the court
and there was nearly a
full-on scrap for the ball,
“we were no
match for
these beefy
girls and even
the scoreboard
couldn’t keep
up with what
might be the
worst score
difference
netball has
ever seen (109-
2)”
a team that had never even
played together before.
All in all, not the best
game of netball we’ve
ever seen, but on the
bright side at least we
don’t care more about
winning Bottle than we
do about going to a decent
uni.
