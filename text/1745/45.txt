Bottle Match: Lacrosse
B
ottle Match
2020 has come
and gone, and
it brought about
a drastically different
result than past years.
Our 100% win streak was
finally broken, with an
(admittedly demoralising)
28-3 loss. Our team put
in a great effort, despite
having the odds stacked
against us; a pitch that
would have worked as
a demonstration of soil
liquefaction, two players
stuck at the football match
after CSM altered the
timetable the day before,
a ball-to-face injury in
the first quarter (shoutout
to Niamh!) removing all

have struggled
in recent years
to reclaim the
egg cup. The only let up
being when the CSM team
put forward their lacrosse
team to play against us
three years ago. With this
in mind, we have under-
gone rigourous training
to be able to stamp our
force on them as RSM’s
biggest club. 10 minutes
in, Parise and James (1st
pair) already won the first
match with big scores:
21-8 and 21-9, lifting up
the team spirit. Louise and
shots and slick play, it
came down to the final
round of games at 3-3.
With the determination
to win and not to do the
yard, Annie and Ben as
well as the first pair pulled
out some great net shots
and smashes which led to
2 massive wins and gave
the overall score of 5-4.
Ben was so happy that he
went on the break his best
racket celebrating. Since
then I have personally had
phone calls from Alice
Gast congratulate me as
well as Boris Johnson and
Sadiq Khan. Please join
RSM badminton.

Adam(C) shortly gave us
the second win by run-
ning the CSM President
around. However, the
second round wasn’t as
easy. After a few tough
matches with both sides
providing some great
hattrick, to man of the
match Anthony Onwuli
for taking every single
draw, toAnnie Mao for her
unparalleled dedication to
screaming “GOT BALL!”
at every opportunity
and to Alfie Baines for
a fantastic effort despite
his inappropriate choice
of footwear and the fact
that this was his first ever
game. I’m sure we’ll be
back stronger next year,
and make sure this is the
first and only time CSM
triumphs over the RSM in
Bottle Match Lacrosse.

options to sub off and a
relatively inexperienced
team. It was always going
to be an uphill battle, and
our enthusiasm and our
best efforts just weren’t
enough. A huge well done
to Stephen Kwong on his
“please
join RSM
badminton”
