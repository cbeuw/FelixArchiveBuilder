Upstart Crow, Outstanding Codpiece
U
pstart Crow
is the theatre
a d a p t a t i o n
of the epon-
ymous BBC television
programme. It follows
the fictionalised life of
William Shakespeare,
the famous playwright
who was once mocked as
as an “upstart crow” by
his contemporary critic
Robert Greene. The play
takes up where series 3
of the television show left
off, telling the story of
how Shakespeare wrote
Othello with the help of
his faithful household. In
true panto style, the plot
is driven by the threat of
the ever-present inter-
vention by the Puritan
“Puretitties” and the loss
of royal favour, with the
show also featuring a
dancing bear, two African
royals and a set of magnif-
icent codpieces.
The stage adaptation
stays true to its original
roots, drawing on Shake-
speare’s own work from
Romeo and Juliet to
Othello. It is just as bawdy
as the original - audienc-
es are warned to expect
some real groaners. Given
the speed with which
each quip is delivered, it
sometimes felt as though
the punch lines didn’t
have quite enough time to
settle. However, a more
than generous audience,
myself included, enjoyed
them immensely.
David Mitchell reprised
his role from the TV series
as the bard, holding the
fort down with a solid
performance as a man
that borrows more than he
creates, particularly from
his well-versed daughters.
While I appreciated some
of the updates that the
show received for the
West End, particularly
the woke African royals
who delivered historically
accurate monologues, I
do believe that some were
completely unnecessary.
They say, never meet your
heroes: I prefer to never
have witnessed David
Mitchell performing
Fortnite dances. Never
have I so rapidly lost all
respect for an individual
as I did when I watched
him uncomfortably dance
“the Shoot.” Mark Heap
also featured prominently
as “Puretitty.” Although I
mostly recognise him as
Jim the neighbour from
Friday Night Dinner, he
was clearly born to play
a self-flagellating Puritan.
He managed to capture
the panto-villain vibe very
well - and I have never
before seen a man so well
suited to a codpiece.
For anyone expecting
intelligent, thought-pro-
voking humour, then this
is probably not the place
to find it. However, if
you’re looking for some-
where where you can
spend a couple of hours
in unthinking amusement,
then this is the play for
you.
Drawing Cities: Art by Stephen Wiltshire
M
ost of us may
have heard
the story
about an
artist, flying in a helicopter
above gigantic cities such
as New York or Shanghai,
who then draws the entire
landscape he has seen
with ridiculous detail on
paper once back on solid
ground. What most of us
don’t know is the name
of this artist and that he is
living in London.
Stephen Wiltshire is
this draftsman’s name
and his art is astonishing.
Focusing on drawing
entire cities, impressive
buildings down to the
fancy cars and London
buses, his drawings are
snapshots from memory,
what he sees in his mind’s
eye.
Born in 1974 in
London, Wiltshire spent
his childhood in Little
Venice. From very early
in his life he expressed
an interest in sketching
animals and cars. This
allowed him to communi-
cate with his surroundings
through his drawings,
something he struggled
to do verbally due to
his diagnosis of autism.
When he was seven years
old, he became interested
in drawing landmark
buildings of London after
being shown a book with
pictures of devastation
caused by earthquakes.
Wiltshire studied Arts
at the City and Guild of
London Arts School, from
which he graduated in
1998. Carrying on with
his passion, he had great
success with his true-to-
scale, out-of-memory
drawings. He went on
to publish several books
throughout his life and
travelled all around the
world seeking inspiration
for his work.
Wiltshire’s fame sky-
rocketed after producing
a detailed drawing of four
square miles of London
out of his memory, based
on a single helicopter ride
above the city. Travelling
around the world, he
visited many different
places, drawing them
right there, or later from
memory alone. Although
he has travelled all
around the world seeking
for inspiration, New York
and London are to him
the most interesting cities.
Stephen’s work is appreci-
ated all around the work,
due to its uniqueness and
attention to detail.
I was lucky to attend
one of his public events in
an Apple store in London,
where Wiltshire gave us
an insight into his work
and passion. It was a
fascinating experience
to see him at work first-
hand, creating complex
drawings with surprising
serenity.
Wiltshire wants to
inspire people, so when
he was asked what he rec-
ommends stressed people
should do, he simply
answered: “just pick up a
pencil and start to draw”.
He believes this offers a
relief to a busy work life
and that one’s own inspi-
ration and happiness will
benefit from it.
You can visit his art
gallery in 22 Palace Court,
Notting Hill London,
which is only a twenty
five minute walk through
Hyde Park. Besides
gazing in amazement at
his drawings, you can
even buy some of the orig-
inals (which are priced
from £2,000 - £200,000).
If that’s a bit outside your
budget, prints or post-
cards are also available. I
recommend everybody to
pay it a visit and guarantee
it will be an exceptional
experience!
