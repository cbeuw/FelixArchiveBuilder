Has the labour movement failed to engage
young people?

people in the labour movement.

espite the
barnstorming
success of
C o r b y n ’ s
labour party with young
people in the 2019 elec-
tions, with 56% of 18-24
year olds voting for the
party, Union participation
is low amongst young
people - in 2018 only
4.4% of the Unionised
workforce was aged
16-24. Given the leftist,
red flag waving rhetoric
of the party, and the close
relationship and backing
of trade unions, this seems
counter-intuitive.
Of course not all
young Labour voters are
leftist ideologues. The
party’s manifesto for
young people focussed
on the climate crisis,
mental health treatment
and (broadly) equality
and a policy focus on
young people, stepping
away from labour
movement issues in all
but a commitment to a
£10 universal minimum
wage.The election result
was also driven by Brexit,
the Labour anti-semetism
crisis and the personal-
ity and draw and of both
Corbyn and Johnson.
The cult of the hustle,
of entrepreneurship and
converting hobbies and
every waking minute into
a source of value, has
seemingly pervaded youth
culture, at the expense
of critical evaluation of
the toll this can take both
mentally and physically
and how well this can
play into exploitative em-
ployment practices such
as ‘flexible’ zero hours
contracts and unpaid
internships. From sites
like Depop to the careers
service encouraging club
participation on the CV,
we cannot escape labour
and optimising ourselves
to participate. This is also
a culture of individualism
- how can I make myself
as employable, as unique
as possible? In this envi-
ronment, trade unionism,
reliant on collective
action and some degree
of resistance (rather than
capitulation) to employers
cannot flourish. ‘Collec-
tive action’ when it does
occur, in the form of
Change.org petitions is
merely an artifice that
gives the signatories
some feeling of power,
as is waiting for officials
elected on the promise of
improving workers rights
to do so.
Often union exposure
can be through the most
extreme of their actions -
a day off school, a closed
Bakerloo line or a picket
in front of Blackett due to
strike action- whilst these
events have inevitably
mixed consequences and
reactions, they do little to
contextualise the purpose
and other workings of
unions. The history of col-
lective action in the UK
(depending on your per-
spective) is rarely seen as
wholly positive, with the
3 day working week and
energy rationing brought
on by miners strikes in the
70s having mixed (to say
the least) lasting legacies
in the collective British
psyche. This is not to say
that strike action should
not occur, but that unions
should engage with the
public to communicate
not only what collective
action has achieved in
the past, but what it could
do for them in the future.
General secretaries should
aspire to boost their
profiles and advocate for
the action of their unions
beyond leftist media
outlets where solidarity
is assumed, preaching
beyond the choir.
The sectors least union-
ised, according to a 2018
UK BEIS report, are the
food and accommodation
industries. Young people
are disproportionately
represented in this sector,
and according to a recent
report, it will be one of
few net growth areas in
terms of employment
prospects. Summer or
part time employees at a
non-unionised workplace
such as a restaurant or
cafe may see little appeal
in the effort of collective
action, even if working
conditions are poor. These
jobs are often stepping
stones to success, sources
of spending money for
Uni or time management
skills on the CV. However
with the job market as it
is, this may not be true
forever as more graduates
are churned out into
the workforce than jobs
suitable for their skill
level - in 2017 the ONS
reported that nearly half of
graduates were working
in non-graduate roles.
Those employed under
zero-hours or other simi-
larly precarious contracts
may also be dissuaded
from organising with
the threat of job loss, or
how easily they could be
replaced with others in the
precariat, desperate for
money and experience.
Despite these precarity
workers having much to
gain from union mem-
bership and organisation,
they do not slot well into
current union structures,
which serve and are
represented in large scale
employers and workplac-
es better than smaller
companies or those where
the workforce is largely
spatially disconnected and
thus less able to physical-
ly organise such as those
who work from home or
using their own vehicles.
The work of having to
recruit enough members
for a union branch, and
even choosing a union to
join in the first place in a
workplace that does not
fit into the standard offer-
ings, will be a barrier to
some. This being said, the
Baker’s Union’s Fast Food
Rights Campaign made
branches more flexible to
enable employees from
different companies and
locations to join collective
town centre branches, an
example of a union de-
liberately engaging with
a growing workforce that
they have not historically
represented.
In short, the labour
movement has, on the
whole, failed to engage
with young people and
the changing landscape
of labour and the culture
surrounding it, despite
high youth turnout for
the Labour party in 2019.
Solutions to this are
twofold - the established
unions need to get wise
to the times by engaging
with the discourse sur-
rounding labour by less
partisan means, and alter
structurally to enable
better engagement and
organisation within tra-
ditionally non-unionised
workforces that dominate
the employment of young
people. Unions? I just came to show off my new poster // Wikimedia
