Bottle Match: Tennis
A
fter an early
start, the RSM
tennis team ar-
rived in a very
windy Falmouth, eager to
put right the loss of the
previous year. Backed by
the raucous support of the
hockey and badminton
teams, the matches began
with Beth, Teigan, Ian and
James entering the singles
courts. Beth and Teigan
(who had both not played
a match before) put in
some great performances
and had some tight games
but in the end, lost their
matches. Ian and James
were both encouraged
by the RSM-dominated
crowd and made good
starts but, in the end, lost
their matches 6-1, 6-1 and
6-2, 6-3 respectively.
Despite the crowd
heading to the hockey, the
intensity on the courts was
still high as Jasmine put in
a player of the match per-
formance before unfortu-
nately losing 6-1, 6-2 and
Cas played a great match
before losing 6-1, 6-3.
Toby and James Hamer
also played well against
much more experienced
opposition, losing 6-1, 6-1
and 6-2, 6-2 respectively.
Our doubles specialists
Sam, Olivia and Ananya
played some great points
in worsening conditions
but again, all the doubles
matches were lost to
CSM’s team (made up of
only one actual ‘miner’).
Despite a 12-0 loss, the
inexperienced team did
brilliantly well in tricky conditions and can hold their heads high.

efore the RSM
Squash team
headed down
to Cornwall for
the Bottle Match, some
emergency training ses-
sions were held in ethos
as it became apparent that
2/3rds of the team had
never picked up a squash
racquet in their life. After
some coaching in the tac-
tics and niches of squash
from the bottle veteran
Meddings we headed
down to CSM, albeit with
one racquet between all
of us. However, as soon
as the first game began, it
became apparent just how
far out of our depth we
were when our opponents
took pity and began to
cheer for us rather than
their own. Alfie put in a

icking off
the second
day of Bottle
2020 was the
football. The stage was
set beneath the ominous
clouds and the crashing
winds atop a great hill,
and what a stage it was: a
pitch so boggy even a pig
would rebuke it! Dare to
stand in one place for too
long would mean sinking
to your ankles in mush.
Good thing the boys were
full of running and fight
then, buoyed by the RSM
supporter massive. Never
once resting on their
laurels and constantly
hounding their opposition
throughout the first half,
the CSM were restricted
to hardly a whiff of
goal. Chances came for
the RSM however, with
searching balls in behind
for strikers Campbell and
Hedley, the latter fashion-
ing out a great shot inside
the box matched only
by the save of the CSM
goalkeeper. Creative
force in the middle, Fred
Masure, had a fantastic
30-yard scorcher whistle
just over the crossbar
before the close of the
first 45. Unfortunately, the
half time whistle came too
early for the boys. With
winds turning and picking
up to gale force speeds,
the momentum swung
to CSM in the second
half. Despite the RSM
maintaining their spirited
performance from the
first half, the opposition
forwards managed to pro-
duce two goals worthy of
winning the great battle:
their second in particular
being a screamer from
25 yards out that must
simply be applauded.
Nevertheless, “win or
lose… on the booze”
became the mantra of the
day, and with their heads
held high the boys in black
and white went out into
the night with the belief
the Bottle will be regained
once more next year.

valiant effort in the second
match, speared on by
some lovely support from
the Men’s hockey team,
and our top seed Alex was
just short of registering
enough total points to
win a game, far more than
Alfie or I achieved. Soon
the slaughter was over,
the games were gone 6-0
and the matches 3-0. Full
credit to the CSM team
and RSM Squash look
forward to welcoming
them back to London next
year.
