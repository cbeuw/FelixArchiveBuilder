s they headed
to the pitch,
the wet, windy
conditions and
swampy Cornish ground
were not in favour of the
visiting team, who prefer
to play a fast-paced, ex-
pansive game.
However, the crowd
did not disappoint;
with the usual RSM vs
CSM rivalry resonating
between the fans and the
players.
Both teams started
well, with strong carries
from CSM’s big boys
being matched by big hits
from the likes of Animesh
Misra, Jasper Mowatt and
Oliver Adams. CSM often
lacked creativity in attack,
relying on kicking and
RSM mistakes to obtain
useful field positions. Fol-
lowing a few phases from
the RSM forwards, man of
the match Elliot Quigley
saw the opportunity to
send the ball wide, and an
excellent backs move was
completed with a try for
Oliver Duffy, converted
by Amin Omarouayache,
for the first 7 points of the
match.
From here, a series of
mistakes and penalties
conceded by the visitors
gave CSM an easy way
back into the game. They
relied heavily on their
dominant scrum, and
dictated play well, which
despite the best efforts
“a series of
mistakes and
penalties
conceded by
RSM gave CSM
an easy way
back into the
game”
CSM were a tad bit too cunning this time around // RSM Rugby Team

Final Scores
of RSMs defence, led to
them scoring a pick-and-
go to go into half-time
of them. We didn’t take
advantage of the wind
behind us in the first half
as well as we’d have liked
but were still confident
that this game is ours for
the taking.
In a scrappy second
period, it was CSM who
scored the first (and only)
points of the half. They
converted a penalty to
make the score 10-7 in
favour of the home side.
The final whistle went in
what had been a physical,
competitive and largely
enjoyable game of rugby.
We look forward to wel-
coming CSM to London
next year when hopefully
the result will be different.
Unfortunately, this
meant RSM could not
retain the Bottle and get
that elusive away win,
but I trust CSM will look
after the Bottle for us until
it is inevitably returned
home next year. Thanks
to all the volunteers who
made Bottle Match such
a success once again,
thanks to our sponsors
(IMR resources and BP)
without whom this event
wouldn’t have been
possible, and thanks to
the supporters for being
so vocal. It was truly a
day to remember, sup-
plemented by a splendid
evening throughout
which multiple shandies
were consumed, but the
less said here the better.
Port, songs, 17, dads,
lips, 51, haircuts, Minnie,
climbing and toys are just
a few things that come to
mind, but I’ll leave all that
to your imagination.

At this point we knew
it was going to be a tough
second half. Their scrum
was dominant but out
wide we had the beating
