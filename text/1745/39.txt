L
ast week the
Wellbeing Team
of the RCSU,
led by me and
Mareya Saba (Wellbeing
Activities Coordinator),
ran a week-long campaign
in support of focusing
on yourself and your
wellbeing: RCS You. The
campaign’s five themes
aimed to bring a different
emphasis to each day:
Community, Mindfulness,
Art, Environment, and
Animals. We took part
in relaxing activities, got
together as a community
of scientists, and empha-
sised healthy attitudes
surrounding mental
wellbeing.
The week was a huge
success, with the finale
consisting in the Dog
Therapy session on Friday
proving to be in extremely
high demand with all 160
slots getting filled within 2
hours. After hearing year
representatives’ feedback
about wanting a dog
petting session in every
student-staff committee
(SSC) meeting for the past
two years, the bureaucrat-
ic nightmare we had to go
through to organise it was
honestly worth it.
The dogs put smiles
on a lot of students faces,
but what problems did
the campaign address or
even try to solve? Last
month, in a College-or-
ganised working group
on Embedding Wellbeing
into the Curriculum, the
state of mental wellbeing
of Imperial students was
described as “fragile”.
The reasons given for
this included that students
come to Imperial having
based their identity around
their intelligence just to
have that ripped out under
them, and for many the
academic pressure can be
too much to handle. Fur-
thermore, the changing
demographic of more
socio-economically disad-
vantaged students partici-
pating in university means
that there are a higher
proportion of students
negatively impacted by
financial stress, which
has been linked to poor
student mental health.
A study ran by the Ed-
ucation Policy Institute in
2018 clearly showed that
mental health issues are
becoming more prevalent
in the university-student
population; the proportion
of 16- to 24-year-olds
experiencing a common
mental disorder increased
by 25% between 1993
and 2014, the demand in
counselling services at
universities increased by
over 25% between 2006
and 2015, and the student
suicide rate increased by
52% between 2000 and
2016.
These issues are the
obvious motivation
behind running a facul-
ty-wide Welfare Week
such as RCS You, but it’s
clear that these events
are not nearly enough.
Firstly, sessions such
as Pet Therapy are only
psychologically effective
with regular interaction,
instead of as a one-off
session. Secondly,
students in a particularly
bad place are far less
likely to put themselves
out there and get involved
in the kinds of activities
that we offered. Finally,
the campaign does
nothing for addressing
the structural issues such
as drained counselling
services, unsupportive
personal tutors, and
systematic academic
pressure.
However, as student
volunteers, our goal
should be to pressure
the faculty on all sides
to take responsibility for
student welfare. Running
light-hearted campaigns
with relaxing activities
such as yoga and colour-
ing comes under this, as
it brings mindfulness and
the concept of wellbeing
to the forefront of the
conversation; simply pro-
viding a short-term escape
from studies is worth
it, even if the positive
outcomes for wellbeing
are also short-term. But
it isn’t enough, and it
can’t just be down to us
as volunteers. During the
remainder of the year we
will work tirelessly to rep-
resent those who couldn’t
participate and those who
aren’t aware of the issues
affecting them. Whether
that’s us as representatives
supporting new initiatives
such as Embedding Well-
being into the Curriculum,
building new roles that
address socio-econom-
ic issues such as the
Working-Class Officer,
or simply being at every
SSC telling staff just how
ineffective personal tutors
are at signposting or safe-
guarding students in need.
There’s so much more that
we can do, and should do,
for student welfare.
We should take respon-
sibility for our collective
wellbeing. Despite devel-
oping a healthy mindset
regarding wellbeing being
a personal and individual
journey, it is still our duty
to support each other as
students, staff and repre-
sentatives.
Whose responsibility is our wellbeing?
