SUDOKU
Fill all the boxes with a number between 1 and 9. A
number can only appear once in a row/column, and
only once in each sub-box.
SHIKAKU
Divide the square into rectangles, such
that each rectangle contains exactly one
number. The numbers given represent
the area of the containing rectangle.
Hi Puzzlers,
This double spread smells of pure procrastination
put perceptively. As promised, the Easter Egg Hunt
explanation:
Well, we’re hoping to have an Easter Egg Hunt in
the paper for the last issue of term, and we wanted
a few decorated eggs to hide in the paper. Wow.
That was not a long a story as I had thought. Sub-
missions for designed Easter eggs will be open un-
til Wednesday noon (4th
March).
Special thanks to Crossword Express and Duncan
White in this issue.
