Binge of the Week: Love Is Blind
O
h boy. What
were the Netﬂix
executives on
when green-
lighting the mess that is
this show? Following the
worldwide success of The
Circle (think Big Brother
meets Catﬁsh) - the UK
version airs on Channel 4
whereas the US/interna-
tional version of broadcast
on Netﬂix - comes a brand
new relationship-focused
reality show, clearly a
strategic attempt from the
streaming giant to step
into the unscripted show
market.
Calling ‘Love is Blind’
batshit crazy would be an
understatement. The show
combines the ever-so-pop-
ular ‘blind dating’ format
with a sprinkle of ‘The
Bachelor’ franchise,
dumping a group of men
and a group of women in
separate houses, asking
them to ﬁnd the love of
their lives by chatting to
each other from their own
little ‘pods’, and not being
able to see each other until
they are engaged. As if
that’s not absurd enough,
they only have about a
week to decide who they
want to marry and about
a month to actually walk
down the aisle.
Over the ﬁrst couple
of episodes, relationships
are formed, proposals are
made; a fuckboy needs to
choose between the three
women he’s promised
to marry, and hearts are
broken. Some contestants
get next to no airtime
(they must be exceptional-
ly boring), and by the end
of the third episode, they
are completely out of the
show, which now focuses
on ﬁve newly betrothed
couples and how their re-
lationships develop or fall
apart, in the real world.
Perhaps the most ludi-
crous part of the show is
watching people who’ve
never seen each other talk
about wanting to have
kids together one minute,
to the same people consid-
ering marrying different
people within the next.
One of the main issues
with the show is that it is
extremely heteronorma-
tive. Granted, given the
premise of the show, it is
difﬁcult to create an en-
vironment where gay and
straight relationships can
co-exist without complete
segregation. However,
the show doesn’t even
attempt to overcome this
problem. Instead, the only
LGBT representation is
a bisexual man who gets
dumped by his ‘ﬁancée’
for ‘not being honest’
upon revealing his sexu-
ality on a couples retreat
in Mexico following their
engagement.
From the get-go,
not only are the ‘pod’
conversations hilariously
faux-deep, but so are
the running commentary
provided by the contest-
ants. The producers of the
show must really want the
audience to remember the
exact premise of the show,
hence the contestants
keep repeating things like
‘I never thought I’d be
engaged to someone ten
years younger than me’ or
‘as a black woman, I’ve
never dated a white man,
but I’ve fallen in love with
who he is inside and that’s
all that matters’. All the
damn time. Frankly, the
show’s insistence to treat
the audience as complete
idiots, having the need to
re-explain the premise a
million times is perhaps
what makes the show
insufferable at times.
Additionally, despite
making a point that ap-
pearances don’t matter,
it sure does feel awfully
convenient that almost
every single person cast
in the show is objectively
good looking. Watching
hot people complain that
people only want to date
them for their looks is a
problem that most of us
can’t relate to. Therefore,
the show comes a mile
short of proving their
hypothesis that love is
indeed blind, as none of
the contestants need to
choose whether to stay
with their ﬁancé(e) based
on their looks. And there
sure is way too much
Love at first sight is overrated - try love at no sight

running commentary on
how worried they are
about how their blind
date would look and later
on how they think their
future spouses are for a
show that aims to take the
looks out of the equation.
I’ve let out many a
shocked scream during
my binge of ‘Love Is
Blind’. The premise is
completely ridiculous,
and while the execution is
spotty at best, it is wildly
entertaining. The show
makes some attempts
to dig deeper into some
profound territory but
never quite makes it there.
However, the overall lack
of depth makes ‘Love Is
Blind’ an easy watch to
roll your eyes to many
times per episode. Now all
that’s left to see is whether
the contestants’ ﬁfteen
minutes of fame outlasts
their relationships.
