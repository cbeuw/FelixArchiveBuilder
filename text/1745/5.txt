Way to Go
this year than it has been previously – and what the advantages of student-led events are
their £50. People always
felt that the standard of
the DJ was subpar. That’s
why we’ve changed those
things.”
Sam Lee, the Technical
Director for DramSoc
and also the Arts and
Ents Treasurer, added:
“I’ve read responses
from last year, a lot of
which said they didn’t
feel like they were getting
value-for-money. There
wasn’t any conversation
with students happening;
the team in charge just
decided what was hap-
pening and didn’t run
very much consultation.
Considering we are a stu-
dents’ union, I found that
interesting. It feels like
there is a lot of distrust in
the Union, and in Union
events, as a result.”
As a result, responding
to feedback became a
core part of the com-
mittee’s priorities. The
‘Enchanted Forest’ theme
was selected based on
popularity and feasibility
from an open submission
consultation that Fifi ran
earlier in the year. The
feasibility played a large
part in the decision, which
is where DramSoc – as
the technical specialists –
had strong input. Equally,
the committee decided
to increase the set design
budget by over eightfold,
from £400 last year to
£3000.
A core result of this
shift in perspective, and
the student-led approach,
was the decision to run
the Ball not as a commer-
cial venture, but rather as
a break-even event whose
focus was to provide the
best possible experience
to students. This decision
was taken after the budget
pitch to the Union’s
Board of Trustees, who
supported the conceptual
adaptation and gave the
go-ahead.
This has allowed for
the inclusion of new
features, such as food and
a prosecco reception, for
a modest ticket price in-
crease – which, according
to the committee, would
not have been possible in
previous years due to the
need to turn a profit.
aspects – I’ve had my say
in the theme of the ball
and even voting on our
chosen headliner.
“This year, student
managers that have also
been on the commit-
tee have been largely
involved in contacting
sponsors, with the help of
our full time bar staff, to
drum up some really great
drink deals and additional
bars and set-pieces.
“Equally, being in-
volved from winter term
has also allowed better
preparation from a bar
perspective. Mapping
out the bar layouts and
developing budgets will
make us better equipped
to deliver an efficient
service on the night.”
Meanwhile, Sam Lee
said that it has drastically
improved opportunities
for creativity with the set
design:
“Previously, a lot of
our work in terms of
lighting design happened
over the Easter break and
over the third term. That
wasn’t much liaising and
consultation with us; for
the most part it was ‘get
it done’ with what we had
been given.
“What makes the
Summer Ball so good is
that even though you’re in
Imperial, you can forget
you’re in Imperial. You
can block out the fact
that you were sitting in
the Great Hall stressed
over your exam a week
before. A big part of that
is set design, which we
are responsible for, and
the increase in budget
for that this year will
make a big difference.
“We’ve got so many
ideas, from a massive
team from DramSoc and
the Art Club, and with
the budget we can really
shift the opinion of the
Ball and bring it up to a
new level. Being involved
from the get-go has upped
quality by opening the
space for more people
to get involved, to let
their creative sides out.
Considering the technical
side before picking your
theme also makes a huge
difference; by picking a
theme that we know we
can deliver really well on,
the result will be much
more cohesive.”
Of course, students
taking up the work comes
with a cost. The level
of time commitment is
high, and with the need to
juggle degrees on top, it
has not been easy. As Sam
Lee said:
“Last term, it was once
a week for two hours on
a Monday to brainstorm,
so it wasn’t too time-in-
tensive, but it increases
when it comes to the
organisation period. What
we could benefit from is
more staff support in that
area, as it’s time-con-
suming to email, phone
people, and so on, so it’s
still student-run but less
intensive for us.”
However, staff support
has not been absent in
other areas. While stu-
dent-led, various members
of the Union team, and
even the College, have
contributed to publicising
and organising the Ball.
Fifi elaborated:
“The marketing team
have been really engaged
and have put out some
great publicity material;
also, the Operations
Manager and the full-
time bar staff have been
engaged with us to discuss
how the venue will look
and how to plan ahead.
The Head of Student
Experience has been
incredibly supportive as
well, any chance he has to
offer support it is always
there. College has been
excellent too, especially
with health and safety.”
In wake of the changes,
there have been learning
experiences on the way –
lessons that the committee
hope will be taken forward
to next year.
“There is still room for
improvement on how and
where we consult with
students; there’s the set of
students who are engaged
more as part of a CSP or
the Union’s structures,
but that’s not always your
average student,” Fifi said.
“If we can find a way to
really effectively engage
with as many students as
possible, we’re absolutely
going to do that – I would
love to have more students
on the committee next
year too.
“I’d like there to
be another position or
two on the committee
for a non-relevant CSP
member, so that any
student can get involved. I
can set the groundwork for
that now, and begin think-
ing about how you would
select those students, and
the next DPFS can decide
how to implement it.
Lastly, if we can have
a Hub for the Summer
Ball Committee, with
lots of information and
updates, it will be easier
for students to know
why changes are being
made, and we can answer
questions directly – rather
than them going to Im-
perial College Exposed
and asking why the prices
have increased. We could
also use it to put out more
consultations earlier, right
from Welcome Week.”
However, each com-
mittee member expressed
wholeheartedly that the
desire to produce an
excellent experience for
their peers – and to prove
that driving events with
student input coming first
is the way to go – was
worth overcoming every
difficulty or challenge. As
Joe put it:
“We’re doing it so that
we can give our peers a
Ball that they will hope-
fully remember long after
they’ve left university.
For me, a student led Ball
is the way forward. This
year is about proving
a point, next year, who
knows. I hope that this can
provide a platform for the
ball to now start growing
and growing, with every
successive committee
bringing new and more
ambitious ideas to the
table. We’re never going
to have a ‘May Ball’ at
Imperial but maybe, with
the right set of students
leading it, we can create
something of our own that
people will be proud to
shout about.
“This is us creating
something for our fellow
students, whereas it felt
in previous years like the
Union taking advantage
of its volunteers, not treat-
ing them with the respect
and level of gratitude that
they deserved, and then
delivering something kind
of underwhelming.”
It will have to be seen
whether the fruits of the
committee’s labours will
produce a top-tier Summer
Ball. However, it is un-
doubtedly insightful to
hear their story, the trials
and tribulations of organ-
ising such a large-scale
event, and the benefits of
bringing students to the
fore of Union planning.
“It seemed
insane that
decisions were
being made
without the
people who
the decisions
affected being
in the room”
Beyond just a change
in the financial budgeting
perspective, each of the
four people Felix spoke
to agreed that the new
decision-making format
resulted in a higher level
of involvement and di-
rection from themselves.
All of them agreed that in
previous years, students
had not had any real input
into the running of the
event, and felt it being
student-led will generate
much better results by
drawing on their exper-
tise and connection to
the student base. As Joe
said, “it seemed insane
that decisions were being
made without the people
who the decisions affected
being in the room.”
Sam Hammond, one of
the Beit Bars managers,
said:
“We really didn’t get
any input last year, which
is in huge contrast to
the committee this year.
From the get-go, I’ve
been involved in decision
making, and it hasn’t
just been on bar-related
“We are doing
it so that
we can give
our peers a
Ball they will
remember
long after
they've left
university”
