Arturo UI: How to Become a Vegetable Dictator
I
mperial’s very own
Drama Society put
together, in less than
5 weeks, an epic
play that combines strong
allegorical imagery with
subtle satire and a pinch
of cauliflower. The magic
happened thanks to the
effort of 15 cast members
together with a 12-strong
technical team.
The plot follows the
story of Arturo Ui, a
gangster who gradually
takes control of Chicago’s
vegetable industry using
a mixture of corruption,
manipulation and assas-
sination. Every step of
his journey mirrors that
of Adolf Hitler, from the
economic crash to the
scapegoating of Jews
and foreigners, to his
“democratic” election
and reign of tyranny. The
most important historical
moments of his rise are
faithfully portrayed. The
play manages to walk
a very narrow line all
the way through - the
audience laughs at the
jokes while hurting at
their horrible allegorical
implications.
Alfred Engedal, who
portrays the title charac-
ter, is the absolute star of
the show. His passionate
monologues, alternating
quickly between viperine
charm and spitting rage,
made such a faithful
impression of his Nazi
alter ego that I often
found myself physically
repulsed. Other perfor-
mances worth noting were
those of Dorien Lijnzaad,
a calculating assassin,
Kacper Neumann, who
somehow managed to
wear a tower of hats
almost a third of his
When It Breaks It Burns
I
n 2015, reacting to
immense cuts in
government funding
for education, many
students occupied high
schools across the country
in large-scale protests..
During this performance,
15 of these students
showed how they lived
through such an intense
experience and the change
it caused in their lives.
The first part of the show
was a reproduction of how
the occupation took place
while during the second
part they showed us how
they bonded between then
and how the experience
changed them.
Instead of an auditori-
um, the audience sat on
a group of chairs in the
middle of a large room.
The dancers were right
among us, sitting on
the chairs, running and
dancing around us, talking
and screaming on top of
each other. Although it
was hard to understand
everything that was said
during this first part, the
chaos created in the room
managed to convey the
emotions they felt. The
interactivity of the per-
formance intensified the
energy in the room, elicit-
ing anxiety and thrills in
the viewers that made it
seem as if we were taking
part in the school occupa-
tions ourselves.
In the second part, the
chairs were put aside,
leaving a wide space for
performers and audience
members to dance
together and creating a
strong collective feeling
between the participants.
This sense of unity was
enhanced by colourful
words embroidered on a
massive banner: solidari-
ty, strength, support... In
contrast to these empow-
ering, strident moments,
the show was full of
kindness and warmth.
The most compelling
part came when the
audience was divided into
small groups, with three
performers in each group.
These performers spoke
about their personal ex-
periences and reflected on
how this episode in their
lives had changed them
for the better. Contrasting
their current selves with
pictures of them from
before to the occupation,
they showed how the
protests had made them
stronger and braver, and
more able to be their true
selves, both externally
and internally. A common
change in all of them
was their hair. They had
all dyed theirs in bright
colours, representing their
newfound bond, and also
their newfound courage
in going out with their
natural afro hair.
While the originality
and interactivity of the
show managed to create
a strong connection
between everyone in the
room, it was also diffi-
cult to follow the events
entirely. Even though the
freedom and authentic
depiction of the perfor-
mance set it apart from
other plays, a slightly less
chaotic structure would
have improved the audi-
ence’s understanding.
The show ended on the
street, with the audience
and performers united,
shouting and protesting
like they had done years
before. Together, we
remembered the essen-
tial points of that night
such as loving ourselves
and being brave. This
unexpected ending left
us hyped and emotional.
Unquestionably, a great
performance for recalling
the importance of fighting
for what we want, and
a novel experience of
theatre from a completely
different perspective.

height, and Yuyu Lee,
who brought energy to
the stage at every oppor-
tunity. A big shout out to
the technical team for an
unexpected fire and very
dynamic sets.
There were some flaws,
however. I didn’t like
the constant signposting
of the parallels between
allegory and history. The
lines, sets and costumes
were all well-built enough
to allow a smart audience
to draw those parallels
without the need to spell
them out. The sound and
light design had great
moments, yet at times
left me wanting more.
Smoother transitions and
a more regular, yet always
subtle, presence would
have elevated the show.
I know I am asking for
professional quality here,
but it is something to
refine. In terms of acting,
the biggest problem was
with volume and clarity
of speech, and I couldn’t
help noticing some
ill-managed forgotten
lines.
All things considered,
The Resistible Rise of
Arturo Ui has confirmed
once more the thesis that
surprised me the most
about this university: that
its incredibly smart engi-
neers and scientists are
also capable of ambitious
amateur artistic pursuits
to a very high standard.
