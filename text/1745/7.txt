E
arly last week,
it was reported
that the home
secretary Priti
Patel had attempted
to force Sir Philip
Rutnam, the most senior
civil servant in the
home office, out of her
department following
disagreements between
the pair. A few days later,
subsequent allegations
were published stating
that government offi-
cials lacked confidence
in Patel’s abilities, with
the claims suggesting
that MI5 had withheld
information from the
politician due to con-
cerns regarding her
competence. The valid-
ity of the accusations is
unclear, with numerous
conservative politicians,
including former con-
servative party leader
Iain Duncan Smith, of-
fering words of support
for Patel and dismiss-
ing the allegations as
baseless. An untiring
advocate of British iden-
tity and autonomy, Patel
was a leading figure in
the leave campaign and
a string of controver-
sies have seen her gain
notoriety.
Born in London in
1972, Patel has been
a formal member
of the Conservative
Party since she was a
teenager. She undertook
a postgraduate degree in
British Government and
Politics before securing
a position as an intern at
the Conservative Central
Office. After a three year
stint in the conservative
Party’s press office,
Patel went on to work
for a personal relations
consulting firm. Her
political career began
when she stood as the
Conservative candidate
for Witham in the 2010
elections in which she
gained a majority of
15,196, a figure that in-
creased to 19,554 in the
2015 elections. In July
2016, when Theresa
May came to power,
Patel was appointed
International Develop-
ment Secretary, which
sparked concerns within
her department due to her
opposition to foreign aid
spending. She resigned
the following year after
it was reported that she
held twelve meetings in
Tel Aviv, Israel, without
informing the Foreign
Office, resulting in
multiple politicians
accusing her of breach-
ing the ministerial code.
Patel spent the next two
years as a backbencher
before being appointed
her current role of
home secretary by Boris
Johnson in July last year.
Regarding political
ideology, Patel is con-
sidered to be right of
the Conservatives. A
self-proclaimed Thatch-
erite, the politician has
cited Margaret Thatcher
as being her political
heroine. The home
secretary found herself
amid controversy over
her tough stance on
criminal justice when
she revealed her support
for capital punishment
on an episode of question
time following her initial
election to the house of
commons. She has since
retracted this position
but has remained
intent on introducing
sweeping measures to
curb criminal activity,
with the Home Office
declaring earlier this
month that 50,000 new
police officers will be
needed across England
and Wales within three
level and the salary of
a job offer. Under the
system, potential im-
migrant workers would
need 70 points to be
permitted to work in the
UK, with an offer for a
skilled job and fluency
in English granting 50
points. The ultimate
aim of the system is to
“reduce the levels of
people coming to the
UK with low skills” and
during a visit to Imperial
last week, the home sec-
retary stated that the new
immigration system will
“enable the government
to take back control of
our own immigration
policy for the first time
in decades”. There have
been concerns, however,
that the new system
will make it difficult
for businesses who rely
on low paid workers,
such as farms and
catering companies, to
recruit new staff. Patel
has shown unwavering
support for the change
nonetheless, despite
acknowledging that her
own parents would have
been prevented from
immigrating to the UK
under the system.

an active Brexiteer
since David Cameron
proposed the EU ref-
erendum, previously
stating that remaining in
the EU’s Customs Union
would “hold our country
back and undermine our
economic and political
freedoms” in an article
published by Brexit-
central. Earlier this
month Patel announced
a points-based immi-
gration system, which
will come into effect
on January 1, 2021, in
which a person’s eligi-
bility to immigrate to
the UK would be deter-
mined by whether they
