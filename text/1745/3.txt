Felix: Why have you
decided to take the
job and move to
Leeds, rather than
stay at Imperial?
SB: I got a call from a
headhunter – that’s often
how it goes, and it’s how
I ended up at Imperial. It’s
not like I was looking at
the time. And then, why
say yes? It’s probably
because I’m at that stage
in my career where I think
I would really like to
lead a university, to be in
charge and be able to do
the things that I think are
really important . I can
ensure I’m maximally able
to influence the culture
and the way people work
together. This is a great
opportunity; Leeds is a
Russell Group university.
I’m feeling like I’m
getting to that stage in my
life where if I don’t take
that jump now, I won’t
have enough good years
in my life to do it with full
energy and conviction.
You don’t do these kinds
of jobs for just 2-3 years,
you need to do them for
longer. So the timing
was right, the university
is great, and it’s also an
adventure to move out of
London – I really enjoyed
London, but it’s also nice
to get to know a whole
other part of the country.
A bit of serendipity!
Felix: So it was about
wanting to expand
the remit over which
you have input. Here
at Imperial, you’re VP
(Education), so you
have oversight of the
Learning and Teach-
ing Strategy, and
things like the curric-
ulum review. Is there
a particular other
area you wanted
input into, that you
don’t have in your
role currently?
SB: As Vice-Chancel-
lor , you are in charge of
everything, so you can
also influence research,
outreach, and societal
impact – as well as the
combination of those
things, which is particu-
larly appealing. I think for
universities to be success-
ful, there need to be strong
communities, and I have
ideas of how to do that. I
also want all universities
to be globally relevant,
and not just focused on
themselves. I’ve always
been keen to think of ed-
ucation not as something
in an individual silo, sep-
arate from research and
societal impact.
I want to think about
education as research-led,
and not just from the per-
spective of having great
research being brought
into education, but also
thinking about how we’re
training students to be the
next generation of global
citizens. Why don’t we
listen to them really care-
fully, and decide based on
what they want in their
education how we frame
our research? I think that’s
what modern research-in-
tensive universities should
be doing much more. It’s
not just going from the
‘top down’ and making
sure students are exposed
to great teachers, but
rather using students as
true partners and making
them influence what
research and research-led
teaching look like.
Felix: Do you feel
like that vision was
something that could
not or was not hap-
pening at Imperial?
Do you think that
in-silo thinking is
something that Im-
perial was not able or
willing to do?
SB:Itishappeninghere,
but I am only responsible
for education at Imperial.
It’s hard to look at my job
that broadly – that’s not
my job description right
now. Now, I obviously
want to do a great job in
education, and I work very
well with the Provost,
ICU, Vice-Deans, Deans,
and Council and so on,
who share these ideas. But
to actually be at the top of
the university, and bring-
ing everybody together
around these kinds of
themes – that’s an exciting
thing to do.
Felix: What did the
rest of the recruit-
ment process look
like after you were
contacted by the
headhunter?
SB: It’s interesting –
it’s an iterative process.
First you speak to the
headhunter, who is briefed
on what the university
is looking for and can
answer your queries. So I
quickly became aware of
the fact that Leeds wants
to move into this area of
more community-build-
ing. They’ve been very
focused on research in
the last seven years, and
they’ve really become
much more visible,
particularly around
sustainably development
goals. They were always
very well-known for
their education, but right
now they feel like they
need to create a bit more
balance to make sure that
the innovative education
remains as visible as their
present amazing research
is.
So they were looking
for someone who had
ideas about how to create
an even stronger commu-
nity of staff and students,
which was very appeal-
ing. I then met with the
Chair of their university
Council, who was very
proud of the university,
and then informally met
with some people in
Leeds to just get a sense
of the city and make sure I
like the feel of the campus
and the city itself! What I
really enjoyed talking to
everybody there, includ-
ing students, is that they
were all very proud and
felt like part of a commu-
nity. Every single person
I spoke to had their own
view of the university,
but it all fit together and
created a very nice picture
of a place that’s happen-
ing and ready for another
phase. The present VC
was very positive about
their team and the univer-
sity too, which is always a
great sign.
It’s in a good place – it’s
not like I have to pick it up
from way below and build
it up first, so we can really
hit the ground running
together.
Felix: Imperial has
perhaps struggled
to develop a sense of
cohesive community
between different
stakeholders. Why do
you think that exists
at Leeds and not so
much at Imperial?
SB:I’mnotsureItotally
agree that’s the case.
It’s definitely changing.
I understand where the
question comes from and
SB: I think it’s very
hard for them not to, as
we’re so far underway
and it’s so clear it needed
to happen. There are so
many people behind it
and so much excitement
around the things we
are doing – and we’re
successful in areas where
we do work together
optimally. It’s not just one
bit of College that’s doing
things. So I find it very
hard to imagine that it
will stop or slow down, as
there are so many people
who are part of my team
with those ideas.
It’s never just one
person – I couldn’t have
done this on my own.
I don’t want to sound
overly modest, but it’s not
me, it’s really everybody
else. All I’ve done is open
doors and enable people
who wanted to do this,
supporting and helping
them. I don’t think that’s
going to stop, and I don’t
think students would
accept it if all of a sudden
if it did.
Felix: The Union’s
block grant fund-
ing, which actually
comes under your
funding umbrella,
will be renegotiated
this year – but it will
be negotiated again
next year too, which
is unusual. Are you
at all concerned that
funding for students
via the Union will
change once you’re
no longer the one
allocating that?
SB: No, not at all. I
think the student reps are
amazing, both those there
now and the ones I’ve
worked with in past

Felix spoke to Simone Buitendijk, Imperial’s Vice Provost (Education), about her decision to take a new role as
Vice-Chancellor at the University of Leeds

that you’re right to quite
a degree, but it’s chang-
ing – especially since we
are much more focused
now on the student expe-
rience and thinking about
education across all of
Imperial. We’re moving
away from looking at fac-
ulties and departments as
completely separate units.
And we need to, because
the Office for Students
are asking things from the
entire university, so even
if we hadn’t figured that
out ourselves we would
be slowly moving in that
direction.
I’m very optimistic
about how Imperial will
continue doing. I under-
stand what you are saying
because I don’t think we
are there yet, but we are
moving, and that’s what
students are telling us too.
Students are very clear
that they want that sense
of community, that they
see themselves and their
colleagues as part of an
Imperial student body, not
only part of a
department – although
departmental identity is
very important too. To be
successful as a university,
you need to create that
sense of the academic
community as a whole.
Felix: I would argue
you’ve been a driv-
er of some of that
change over the past
few years, based
on the vision that
you have. Are you
concerned that this
change, and your
projects such as the
Learning and Teach-
ing Strategy being
halfway through,
how do you ensure
your successor con-
tinues on the right
path?
