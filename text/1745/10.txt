A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week Felix spoke to the Union President, Abhijay Sood, about too many topics to list!
Felix: I wanted to
start by catching up
with you on rent.
What’s happening
with the Imperial Cut
the Rent campaign,
and with the rent
renegotiations in
general?
AS: The campaign is yet
to have its first meeting,
which will take place at
6.15pm on Monday 2nd
March, in SAF120 (in the
Sir Alexander Fleming
building.) Our intention
is to set up a space where
students can initially get
involved, but from then
on it will be self-organised
by motivated students. We
will discuss the actions
that were endorsed by
Union Council at the
Extraordinary Meeting.
Whatever we do next is
down to what those who
attend want us to do.
Felix: Will the peo-
ple who will run the
campaign, an inter-
nal committee, be
elected at this first
meeting?
AS: That depends on the
structure that interested
students want to have –
there are different ways of
running a campaign. You
can have a very traditional
structure, with an elected
chair and committees and
such, but many campaigns
even at this university
don’t run that way – for
example, Divest has no
centralised leadership. We
want to listen to students,
not impose a method.
Felix: Why have it be
members of the pan-
el felt challenged, or
that their alignment
is still the same as at
the start?
AS: I think that people
are capable of change,
but only so much. Fun-
damental differences in
the positions of different
actors did not necessarily
change. Having said that,
there are some individual
things that I did not realise
before. Some technical
things about how fund
managers operate, which
is interesting no matter
what you think of the
ethical questions. Some of
the details of how different
firms and fund managers
have come to different
conclusions, too. Some
of the fund managers had
already divested from
some of the fossil fuel
companies, for example,
either because they did
not see them as viable
investments, or because
they had tried to engage
with the companies about
renewable energy invest-
ment and had pulled out
when those firms’ actions
didn’t match their words.
The financial sector is
already moving along this
trajectory; what happened
to tobacco is starting to
happen to fossil fuels.
Felix: The block grant
negotiations are also
ongoing – the bid
from the Union to the
College for funding.
How’s that going?
AS: It was delayed a little
because of the Managing
Director stepping down,
but is now in progress.
Because of some of the
issues the Union has faced
this year we’re making a
one-year bid instead of the
typical three, alongside a
one-year strategy plan to
bring different teams into
alignment and to align the
resources we have with
the needs students have
in the short-term, which I
don’t think we have been
its money. While some of
the details of the decision
are not necessarily exactly
what I or most students
would want, they are a
big step closer to that than
when we started. That will
be reflected in the content
of the policy released on
Monday. This is a real,
constructive, positive
shift from where the
College was to where we
would want it to be, and
it leaves the door open to
revisiting this issue and
strengthening the policy in
coming years depending
on how firms we invest in
respond, and depending
on the external pressures
change. From that point of
view I think it’s been very
productive. It’s been a
testament to what student
representatives can do,
together, when they think
about the incentives that
other people in the room
have, when they realise
the ability and power they
have – for example, us
realising we can bring this
to College Council – and
following things through
productively by construc-
tively challenging people
rather than by starting
off with being a bit of a
doormat and just accept-
ing the status quo at face
value.
While I don’t necessarily
agree with the views of
everyone we interacted
with on the panel, I think it
was largely very construc-
tive and that the sessions
we had were informative
and interesting. That’s the
sort of collaboration we
need going forward, with
students and staff and
senior management are
sitting on the same level
and discussing issues on
their merit.
Felix: And what was
your experience
there like? Was your
mind changed at
any point, or were
you surprised by
anything? Equally, do
you think that other
purely student-led,
rather than run by a
Sabbatical Officer?
AS: We didn’t think it
would be appropriate.
We want the Union to
support and facilitate
action other students
might want to take. We’ve
had a productive role in
the negotiations thus far,
but it’s not up to us to
dictate what happens next
without wider student
involvement.
Felix: The College has
now published the
prices for 2020/21.
Thoughts?
AS: We weren’t happy
with the outcome of the
negotiations and how
information was shared,
and we’ve talked about
that in Felix and on our
blogs. But we did move
the College in the right
direction on this.
Even though in the short
term it’s going to be a
challenge to reopen this
as a topic for debate, we
hope that in the long-term
with the added pressure a
student-led campaign can
give, that we will be able
to reopen this issue and
discuss it in the broader
context of the College’s
over-arching decision
making. We want to
limit areas where they’re
working against them-
selves and doing wrong
by students.
Felix: A few Union
Council members
repeatedly expressed
(including in Felix)
that they felt uncom-
fortable with the way
discussions about
rent were conducted
in Council by yourself
and Shervin, saying
they felt pressured
into making deci-
sions too quickly and
with too little infor-
mation. What are
your thoughts?
AS: I understand where
those criticisms are
coming from. However,
any information we
received that was not
explicitly confidential
was shared with the
Council, and we shared
it in the same timeframe
in which we received the
information ourselves. We
tried to be as proactive
as possible in involving
those members in the
conversation.
Thetruthisthatsometimes
in a negotiation, especial-
ly a really important one,
decisions have to be made
in a time-compressed
fashion. Sometimes
you get the information
or the deal at the last
minute, and you have to
take a decision on it. At
that point, the sabbatical
officers have a choice. I
could, as President, say
‘this is the direction we
are going in, here is what
we will do’ – or I could
say ‘here is what I think
we should do, but I will
consult with a wider array
of representatives because
I believe in our democrat-
ic processes.’ That’s the
way we tried to approach
this. I’ve had conversa-
tions with a lot of those
who expressed discomfort
with some of the timelines
around this, about how
sometimes you just have
to be decisive. But that
doesn’t mean you have to
exclude representatives,
and we worked our asses
off to not exclude people
– to be as inclusive and
transparent as possible.
We’ve done lots of direct
communication with
students about the issue,
we brought every single
substantive change the
College offered on the
deal back to the Council,
and every time we weren’t
sure whether we should
or could share something
we erred on the side of
sharing more. Particularly
when we were asked
questions. I don’t think
that under the circum-
stances we could have
been more transparent,
and I’m sorry that people
felt uncomfortable with
some of the timescales
involved, but I also don’t
think it would have been
possible to do anything
differently. I don’t have
any regrets about how we
dealt with that process
with regards to Union
Council. And it’s worth
noting that only a small
minority of members felt
that way.
Felix: You were also
a part of the Work-
ing Group set up on
socially responsible
investment at the
College, after you
submitted the paper
to College Council
alongside the DPFS
and Ethics and En-
vironment Officer.
They’ve now report-
ed back to the Coun-
cil (after consultation
with the Endowment
Board, who control
investments), who
passed the policy
with some minor
caveats and will be
announcing that on
March 2nd along
with a report on the
working group’s
activities. That pol-
icy would bind the
Endowment Board’s
investment deci-
sions. What was that
process like, and how
do you feel about the
result?
AS: Overall, we got out
of this process what I
expected to get out of
it. When I ran for this
position, part of my
manifesto was helping to
bring an end to some of
its unethical investments
and getting the College to
consider the ethical impli-
cations of where it invests
its money. We have done
that. For the first time,
Imperial has a policy that
factors in ethical concerns
when the College invests
