The Summer Ball: Why Student-Led Events are the
NEWS
Henry Alman
Editor-in-Chief
T
he Summer Ball
– the largest
Union event of
the year – runs
every year on the penul-
timate week of the final
term, with the date this
year falling on Saturday
20th June.
The Union, with the
help of various CSPs and
student representatives,
transforms large parts
of the South Kensington
campus into a mixture of
a fancy ball and a carni-
val, featuring fairground
rides, a live music act, a
fireworks display, and an
afterparty hosted in 568
and Metric. Each year’s
Ball is based around a
different theme – with this
year’s being ‘Enchanted
Forest’.
Thisyear’sBallfeatures
several distinct changes
from previous years. The
headline act will be live,
rather than a DJ, with the
announcement of the act –
who is promised to be an
exciting name – coming
next week. Food and a
prosecco reception are on
offer as included in the
ticket price for the first
time, and the fireworks
display is coming back
in full glory. This has
resulted in an increase in
ticket prices, with Early
Bird tickets for both the
Ball and afterparty selling
for £57.50.
The biggest change,
however, is one behind-
the-scenes. While most
students simply attend
and enjoy the festivities,
months of planning from
dozens of people goes into
making the Ball a reality
every year. Previously, the
event was run as for-prof-
it, headed by the Union’s
Commercial Services
directorate – who also
operate the bars, shops,
and online merchandise
the Union sells.
However, this year the
Ball is fully student-or-
ganised. Every aspect,
from the budgeting to the
administration to the act
of setting it up is being
run by a student commit-
tee, chaired by the Deputy
President (Finance and
Services), Fifi Henry, and
comprised of key student
volunteers who have
worked on previous Balls.
These students broadly
fit into four groups: the
Arts and Entertainments
Management Group, who
oversee a variety of soci-
eties; the Beit Bars staff;
the DramSoc technical;
and relevant sabbatical
officers, namely the DPFS
and DPCS, Thomas Fer-
nandez-Debets.
According to these
key volunteers, each of
whom has been involved
in Union-organised
Balls in previous years,
this change represents a
significant improvement
in both the experience of
running the Ball, and the
end result for students.
Felix spoke to four of
them, one from each of the
aforementioned groups, to
get their perspectives.
Fifi Henry, the DPFS,
described how the change
was made – and reveals
that it initially came to be
after an attempt to cancel
the Summer Ball entirely.
“There was a proposal
put forward to the Lead-
ership Team at the Union,
saying that the Ball should
be scrapped and scaled
back to a Carnival event in
Beit or moved externally
– which would have sig-
nificantly increased ticket
prices and lost us any
control over the event. We
didn’t want to scrap it, and
I in particular felt it was
a really valuable event.
Though there had been
issues in the past, people
did still always come to
the Ball.
“A paper for cancelling
the Ball was submitted to
the Board of Trustees by
the Head of Commercial
Services, and I argued
that I would instead
rapid planning began. The
committee was put to-
gether in quick time, with
a large task ahead of them
and little time to do it in.
“I then had five weeks
to create a budget – item-
ising everything, breaking
it down, and costing it
all – to present at the next
Board meeting. I had to
turn around and quickly
get the committee set up,
to start working on what
we wanted the Ball to look
like so we could submit
that. I didn’t have much
event experience, but the
Board needed buy-in; to
know I had a handle on
this.”
Reactions to the Ball
had often had a negative
cast in prior years, with
student feedback raising
complaint that they did
not receive enough for
the cost of their ticket.
Despite high attendance
every single year, the
student committee felt
that this indicated a clear
change was needed.
Joseph O’Connell
-Danes, the Arts and En-
tertainments Management
Group Chair, said: “we
were all in agreement that
the last couple of years it
has just felt like you paid
to go to the same campus
that you were on day in,
day out and didn’t really
get much for the money.
As such the focus has
really been on creating
an experience from the
moment you set foot in
the venue and so we have
put considerably more
emphasis (and money) on
the set design for the ball.
Lydia has come back with
some incredible plans and
all credit to her, if it looks
like the plan it will be jaw
dropping.”
Fifi corroborated: “For
most students who have
been to Balls in the past,
their feedback has never
been listened to, and the
same thing has been put on
offer every year without
much development or
progress. People always
felt that they didn’t get
value-for-money out of
