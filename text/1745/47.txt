Bottle Match: Women’s Hockey
W
ell that was
a weekend
and a half!
The RSM
women’s hockey team
set off to Cornwall on
Friday morning to face the
CSM women in what was
deemed to be an exhilarat-
ing game.
From the first whistle,
every member of the RSM
team played their hearts
out, leaving nothing on
the pitch. It was a fast
and physical match, with
the RSM being attacked
from every angle. The
RSM ladies were able to
defend the CSM to the
best of their ability, but
the pressure was relent-
less with multiple short
corners being awarded to
the CSM. In goal, Antoi-
nette did a brilliant job at
keeping out several close
and difficult shots at goal.
The RSM managed to
catch a couple of brakes
towards goal, with Nadia
and Neha working well
together to keep the CSM
at bay.
Despite the RSMs best
efforts, the CSM won the
match 21-0, but the score

line is far from being a
fair reflection of the effort
that every RSM lady put
into the match. Despite
the multiple bruises and
injuries, the celebrations
continued throughout
the weekend on Friday
evening and throughout
Saturday. Many thanks
to all the players and sup-
porters that kept the RSM
ladies powering through
the match. Hockey love!
