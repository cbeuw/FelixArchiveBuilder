Solidarity Rally Boost for UCU Strike
T
rade union
leaders, Labour
Party MPs and
others joined
a well-attended rally in
support of striking uni-
versity workers in central
London on Tuesday. The
rally came on the fourth
day of 14 days of strike
action by members of the
University and Colleges
Union, who are in dispute
over pensions and pay.
MarkSerwotka,general
secretary of the PCS
union, pledged a donation
“in the thousands” to the
UCU hardship fund. Jane
Loftus, president of the
CWU postal workers’
union, said the UCU
strikes are “a fight for
every worker facing
unfair pay, insecurity and

attacks on their pensions.”
Other speakers included
shadow chancellor John
McDonnell.
Josh Holland, a UCU
rep at University College
London (UCL), told the
rally, “People have taken
a huge hit in their pay
packets. Some people
earn between £12 and £17
an hour, and they don’t get
paid for all the hours they
spend doing preparation.
We need your solidarity.”
Some UCU members,
especially those on lower
wages, worry about losing
14 days pay. Reps at the
rally appealed for dona-
tions to local strike funds,
and a need to counter
impressions that UCU
members are all highly
paid academics. Many
are in fact on insecure or
casualised contracts and
are low paid. Some say
they can’t afford to strike
for all 14 days, so may
need to get help from
hardship funds.
Over the Christmas
period, 15 UCU branches
re-balloted and met the 50
percent turnout threshold
required for legal strikes.
This round of walkouts is
the biggest yet, involving
around 50,000 UCU
members at 74 universi-
ties across Britain.
Over 3,000 people have
joined the UCU since the
strikes began. On the same
day as Tuesday’s rally,
membership of Imperial
UCU reached its highest
ever figure.
Our President Alice
Gast is now the UK’s best-
paid university vice-chan-
cellor, enjoying a total
renumeration package
of £554,000 (including
the rental value of the
apartment she occupies
on campus). College man-
agement, however, refuse
to make a meaningful pay
offer that could end the
strikes.
Our dispute is formally
about pay and pensions,
but it is also about the
marketisation of educa-
tion. Universities see staff
as overheads to be cut
as they compete to make
money from students,
charging ever-higher
tuition fees. As one pick-
et-line slogan says, “Good
teaching conditions are
good learning condi-
tions.” We ask students
to support the strikes and
visit our picket lines. Our
fight is your fight too.
Cont. from page 3
years. If anything, I
think the College and
Union are working more
closely together, and the
Union strategy is well-
aligned with the College
strategy. I can’t see that
that’s going to change.
Felix: The Leeds press
release spoke about
your time at Imperial,
but perhaps more
about your previous
role at Leiden in the
Netherlands. Do you
think your role there
was impactful in be-
ing picked?
SB: They liked the
fact that I’ve had two
universities in my career
at which I was responsible
for education and student
experience. Leiden is
different to Imperial – it’s
more comprehensive,
it has humanities and
social sciences as well, as
Leeds does. It was both
innovation I brought here
and the experience I had
there, where I also led on
big change programmes.
It was interesting that they
looked at all eight years
of experience as a VP
(Education).
Felix: Lastly, one of
the things the Leeds
press release talked
about was your
dedication to inclu-
sivity and diversity. A
couple of years ago,
there was some con-
troversy over some
Tweets you reshared
which some students
considered to be
transphobic, result-
ing in an open letter
being written. How
will you reassure
Leeds students about
this matter?
SB: I don’t think there
is much I need to say.
I think what I did back
then, in talking to the stu-
dents who were worried
and issuing a statement,
enabled us to come
together very well and
there has been no issue
at all here. That worked,
we are happy with where
we are at currently. My
conviction to inclusivity
and diversity remains
and is unwavering. So I
don’t think there will be
one when I go to Leeds.
I would like to leave it
at that. If students there
need reassurance, I’ll say
exactly the same as when
I reassured students here.
