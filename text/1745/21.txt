Sonic the Hedgehog: Movie Review
I
never thought that
I would see the day
that I could witness
Sonic the Hedgehog
flossing on the big
screen… twice. Sonic the
Hedgehog was an unex-
pected announcement a
couple years ago when it
was first revealed; after
much controversy and a
complete redesign we can
finally sit down and absorb
1 hour and 40 minutes
of Paramount produced,
Sega filled goodness.
Watching this in half
term may have been a
mistake as I was surround-
ed by screaming children
and grumpy mothers who
had no idea who the blue
furball on the screen was,
but hey, that’s just part
of the fun of going to the
cinema!
The story begins with
the eponymous Sonic
fleeing from enemies in
his home world, jumping
through a ring portal to
escape danger. He ends up
in a small village called
Green Hills (named after
the first Sonic world
‘Green Hill Zone’). Sonic
must remain hidden but
one day produces so much
energy that he becomes
a two-legged, blue EMP
that naturally garners
attention from the govern-
ment. From this point on
Sonic must flee from the
charismatic and maniacal
Dr. Robotnik (played by
Jim Carrey) with the help
of Tom ‘Doughnut Lord’
Wachowsky (played by
James Marsden), all the
while trying to find his
rings to let him escape
through another portal.
The rest of the movie
plays out like a typical
game of cat and mouse (or
eggman and hedgehog?)
Sonic won’t be
“clichés that
present
themselves
throughout
the story”
“surprisingly
brilliant; slow-
mo shots
and big set
pieces were
excellently
executed”
winning any awards for
story, but this spin on the
fastest hedgehog in the
word makes for a nice
departure from the video
games. Some may find the
unfaithfulness to source
material annoying, with a
lot of what Sonic can do
being highly exaggerated
or completely made up…
but come on guys - it’s
Sonic.
One complaint I do
have about the movie is
the clichés that present
themselves throughout the
story; only so many times
can I hear the phrase ‘my
FRIEND’ uttered before I
begin to cringe. Another
issue is the occasional
overreliance on potty
humour. I have nothing
against it, but when it is
poorly timed it can just
feel entirely pointless and
unnecessary.
However, I must give
credit where credit is due;
the conversations between
Sonic and Tom did get me
laughing, with snappy
one-liners a growing
connection between the
two creating some really
charming interactions that
made the stakes at the end
of the movie feel more
real.
Another place that
SonictheHedgehogshines
has to be in its music. The
soundtrackwas one area
that remained faithful to
the games, with remixes
of Green Hill Zone
(amongothers) creating a
tonal consistency within
a nostalgia driven melody.
Nostalgia is one thing
that Paramount and Sega
really did right here. From
Sonic constantly referring
to Robotnik as ‘Eggman’,
to Sonics idle animation
in the original game being
shown off in style as he is
shot in slow motion from
all directions, I constantly
felt my childhood flow
back to me. My favourite
moment had to be when
a child gave Sonic some
new shoes to replace his
old worn out ones: red
trainers reminiscent of
the classic Sonic shoes he
wears in the game.
The action scenes as
well were surprisingly
brilliant; slow-mo shots
and big set pieces were
excellently executed,
far better than any video
game movie deserves to
be. Whether you think
the redesign was always
intended or not, you have
got to give it up to the
animation team for pro-
ducing such high-quality
CGI throughout the film.
The immediate com-
parison for this movie
has to be last years
Detective Pikachu. While
Sonic looks to speed past
Pikachu in the box office,
I think they are pretty
equal endeavours.
Whether you enjoy one
over the other will really
depend on where your
loyalty lies as a fan. Either
way though, it is great to
see the world of video
game movies growing
given the typical low
quality that has plagued
similar attempts in the
past. With a post credit
scene setting up a poten-
tial sequel, I am looking
forward to what more
could come from Sega in
the future!
Overall, Sonic the
Hedgehog was a great
nostalgia trip for me and
a great introduction to
the titular character for
younger audiences. It both
serves as a respectful ad-
aptation of the character,
whilst equally standing
on its own right as a mild
action movie. I would
have liked to see less crude

Sonic the Hedgehog
Does nostalgia win out over crude humour and cliché moments?
humour and less cliché
moments – however,
given that the movie is
likely looking to appeal to
a wide audience of mainly
children, I can forgive its
shortcomings. All in all, I
had a good time watching
this; It is nothing to write
home about, but it makes
me look forward to the
world of video game
movies and that in itself is
a wonderful thing. 3.5/5!
