Some might say that us
students are overburdened
with unions. With the one
we have, why would we
need any more? Would re-
sources not be better spent
centralised supervised by
full time staff as opposed
to underqualified student
volunteers. I would
strongly argue, however,
that it is these parts of our
history that are important
to preserve. In fact it is
the experience that I have
with the larger Union that
makes me so convinced
of the importance of the
CUs. While Union staff
have the benefit of being
full time and sometimes
experience in the role that
they take on, they lack
an understanding of the
unique circumstances and
challenges of studying
in London that students
grasp implicitly. The
advantage of having cur-
rently studying students
in these roles and able to
implement policy can’t,
therefore, be overstated.
I fear, however, that in
recent years the star of the
Constituent Unions has
been wanning. Students
now are more likely than
ever to affiliate them-
selves to their department
and departmental society
rather than their union and
friends of mine that are
involved in the CUs talk
about the first challenge
of organising events being
telling students what they
are.
I think the remedy
for this is boldness on
the part of the students
involved in the running
of the CUs. The long
and terminal decline will
not cease unless drastic
action is taken to halt it.
To find examples of what
to do we must look to the
that offer a more relaxed
and enjoyable sense of
camaraderie than the
more serious university
level sports teams have
been successful, both in
informing students what
the RSM is and binding
together those under its
mantle.
This should be the first
act on the part of the other
CUs. Not only are there
other teams with whom
to naturally compete but
training could be done
together and experience
pooled in order to keep
costs low. An annual
competition between the
CU teams would be sure
to draw a crowd and be
a good source of revenue
for CUs that have found
themselves struggling to
define their purpose as
attention fades.
The second act of the
CU committees should be
to bring onboard depart-
mental societies. Rather
thancompetingforstudent
attention student volunt-
ers should swallow their
pride and remember that
everyone got involved in
order to improve student
experience, not to fight
over trivial matters. The
CUs should be sources of
community at a university
that threatens to fragment
into a multi-campus con-
glomerate but it will take
insight and hard work on
the part of the various
committees to bring this
about.
H
ere at Imperial
we are quite un-
usual in having
C o n s t i t u e n t
Unions (CUs). Relics of
the old institutions that
were mashed together
to make Imperial they
are the joining scars that
are all that remains of
the old Royal School
Why do we have Constituent Unions?
