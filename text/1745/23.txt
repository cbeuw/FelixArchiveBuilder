B
uilding my
own PC has
been in the
back of my
mind for a while now,
but it was always
rather daunting. I think
a few people reading
this – being far more
tech-savvy than myself,
I am sure – might find
that a little amusing,
but I also think a lot of
people feel the same
way. It’s a relatively
complex thing, filled
with reams of jargon,
compatibility issues, and
of course the perceived
risk of making a mistake
and frying your new
expensive hardware.
I think that penulti-
mate word – ‘expensive’
– is part of what scares
people away, rather than
the complexity. It’s the
same reason I’ve never
really learned to cook
a steak properly. It’s
not that it’s enormously
complicated, but that the
financial cost of failure
is high if I burn it to hell.
I’d rather take the risk
of ruining something
cheap, and learning to
cook that.
However, as I’m
learning, if you’re
careful and systematic
about the way you
approach your build, it’s
not that bad – and you
can save yourself more
than a couple of quid if
you buy parts yourself,
rather than getting
something customised
online or, God forbid,
buying a premade.
Now there are a
couple of caveats here.
You won’t have tech-
nical support should
something go wrong,
for example, and your
warranty coverage is
somewhat more limited,
as it will only address
failures of individual
components. For uni
components, from ebay
to Facebook market-
place to Gumtree. While
you can find some
great deals, there is an
obvious risk: you have
no guarantee the items
will work, or whether
they are on their last
legs.
For this reason,
there are a few parts
to only ever buy new,
and they’re those that
(should they get a bit
wobbly) are more likely
to damage your system
as a whole. Namely, the
power supply and moth-
erboard. I’d also advise
getting your data storage
new, especially if it is a
mechanical harddrive,
as often a good deal
on used drives implies
they’ve been thrashed
pretty hard in some
server setup. Lastly, if
you’re going to buy used
parts, make sure you
have an opportunity to
test them – ask the seller
if they can set it up for
you so you can run some
benchmarks. Failing
that, go to ebay, where
they have a 30-day mon-
ey-back guarantee on
items that don’t match
their description.
Now there’s a good
word – ‘benchmarks’.
Best explain that, too.
Benchmarking is
the practice of using
software suites to
test the performance
of your system, or of
individual components.
They’re often the best
way, realistically, to
tell what components
are ‘good’ in terms of
performance and which
are not. Online databas-
es of benchmarks can
be used to compare and
contrast components
and systems.
Which benchmarks
you use will depend
on both what you want
to test, and what your
system is designed for.
Some popular examples
for gaming benchmarks
include the 3DMark
suite, which conducts
test on the graphical per-
formance and physics
calculations of your
computer, or Cinebench,
which is a CPU-oriented
test that examines how
quickly your computer
can render a hyper-re-
alistic image. Another
is Prime95, which is
designed essentially
to test the stability of
your system and the
effectiveness of your
cooling by performing
a ‘torture test’ on your
CPU – in other words,
putting it under full load
and seeing how high it
can crank up your tem-
peratures.
T e m p e r a t u r e s ,
voltages, and so on of
your components can
be monitored using
free software like
HWiNFO64. If it’s not
clear – high tempera-
tures are bad, as they
can damage components
or, failing that, cause
your system to throttle
the performance of your
components so as to
avoid damage.
Another type of
benchmark are ‘re-
al-life’ ones. For gaming
especially, there is an
abundance of YouTube
videos and online
articles that directly test
the frames-per-second
in various games of dif-
ferent components and
systems.
Lastly, I want to
discuss budget vs.
performance. This is
always hard to weigh-up
– is adding £20 to
your budget to get that
slightly better processor
worth it?
The best way to look at
it, I think, is in terms of:
● What you need from
your system. Build to the
minimum that you need,
or rather the minimum
you are likely to need in
the next couple of years.
Don’t spend on perfor-
mance you won’t actually
utilise – if you’re a gamer
but all you play is graph-
ically-unintensive titles
like League of Legends,
don’t buy a £500 graphics
card. Equally, don’t skimp
out on spending an extra
£50 if it means your
computer actually does
what you need it to – or,
alternately, if it would
mean saving £300 on an
upgrade a year later. This
hardware and software but
has no longevity, is smart
and saves you a lot in the
long run.
● How much you
have to spend, and how
flexible you are in that.
If you have a hard limit,
you might have to make
hard choices, and focus
on optimisation of price
vs. performance. You can
even phrase it as a ratio
– take a benchmark that
reflects your usage, for
example the frames-per-
second in your favourite
game, and divide that by
the price of a component
to get maximal efficiency
above some minimum
performance threshold
(e.g. 40 frames per second
in most single-player
games, 60 for competitive
ones.)
● Spend on compo-
nents that last. Look for
good warranties on items
you’re buying new. A
good power supply, for
example, can last you the
better part of a decade,
and can be switched
between systems when
upgrading very easily. The
TX650M I just bought has
a seven-year warranty. By
contrast, other compo-
nents, such as processors
or graphics cards, are ri-
diculously outdated seven
years down the line – for
reference, a graphics card
from seven years ago can
just about run modern-ish
games at 15-20fps on
lowest settings at 720p,
and that’s it.
I’ll be back next week
to start breaking down
what individual compo-
nents you’ll need, and
how to best assess the
performance and compat-
ibility of each one!
“If you’re

systematic

work, the fear of having
a catastrophic meltdown
right before a deadline
is enough for most of
us to want that reliable
support.
But, if you’re looking
to build a gaming or
editing rig for your
own hobbies, this might
be the way to go. One
noticeable benefit
for a hobbyist is that
you can swap out or
upgrade parts freely
without worrying about
voiding the warranty for
anything else in your
system, which is usually
not the case if you buy a
prebuilt.
Before I dive into the
components breakdown
next week, there’s a few
more things to discuss.
Firstly, the dilemma
of buying used vs. new
parts. There is a thriving
online market for
second-hand computer

obvious risk:
you have no
guarantee
the items
will work, or
whether they
are on their
last legs.”
often ties into compati-
bility – buying a slightly
newer component that is
likely to be compatible
with next year’s releases,
rather than an old one
that can deal with today’s
