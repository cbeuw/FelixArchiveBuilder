American Factory (2019)
I
can’t remember
exactly when I
first heard about
American Factory.
It was either on my
Facebook feed or on the
6 o’clock news where I
saw a clip with Chinese
employees having a
meeting about how to
best interact with their
American colleagues. In
this clip phrases such as
“American children are
showered with praise, so
everyone who grows up in
the US is overconfident,”
and “Americans love
being flattered to death”
are bashed around. This
clip, alongside a recent
Academy Award win and
having the Obamas as
producers, made this, for
me, a must see. Directors
Julia Reichert and Steven
Bognar start the story with
the closing of General
Motors on the outskirts
of Dayton, Ohio, one of
the many repercussions of
the 2007 financial crisis.
Fast-forward six years
and Cao Dewang, billion-
aire founder of Fuyao, a
Chinese automobile glass
company, has bought the
factory, bringing jobs, joy
and enthusiasm to the area
once more. Workers are
brought in from factories
in China to help show
the Americans their way,
in the hope that eventu-
ally everything will be
passed over to the Amer-
icans when ready. After
a suitably lengthed hon-
eymoon phase, relations
between the two cultures
begin to splinter as both
parties realise that things
aren’t like what they’re
used to at their previous
factories.
Often we find clever
editing and consumer
demand can alter the truth
telling aspects of news
an angle in the Netflix
special American Factory
: A Conversation with the
Obamas. The downside
to such ‘pure’ filmmaking
reveals itself in the finale
as we, the audience, look
for a conclusion and an
idea of the future for
the factory. We almost
get some semblance of
a coherent ending, with
staff reflecting on their
new lives in the factory,
before, out of nowhere,
we swerve to reflect on
more recent events that
have nothing to do with
the previous two hours.
For me, this docu-
mentary manages to
encapsulate America
pre-Trump. Things are not
perfect, however every
struggle that people have
in this documentary is
not politicalised to the
extent that it is today.
This film simply explores
the interaction of people
with conflicting goals and
pressures. Managers and
workers alike from China
aim to create a respect
and love for their home
country in this small Ohio
town. They also have
the pressure of teaching
inexperienced employees
to get to a level of produc-
tion matching factories
that have existed for over
thirty years, all while
living hours and hours
away from their families.
On the side of the Amer-
icans is the reality and
adjustment of never being
able to live with the same
disposable income they
had in their previous jobs
with General Motors,
alongside a shocking drop
in working conditions.
Naturally it is the clashes
that acquire the most
shock value and discus-
sion, but it’s the moments
where the cultures try to
understand each other
which are the real jewels.
One storyline follows
a former employee of
General Motors. A horse
loving, gun collector from
the midwest who when
employed by Fuyao,
embraces the Chinese
culture alongside sharing
his own, leading to
him calling his diverse
co-workers ‘his best
friends’. When this staff
member eventually loses
his job, he is not angry,
but grateful, claiming to
‘have learned so much
from his friends’ proving
that he got so much more
from the experience than
just employment.
Iwouldrecommendthis
film for anyone looking
to have a realistic view
on the different working
class conditions and pres-
sures across the world. I
would also recommend
this for anyone living and
working in a place where
the blending of cultures
is inevitable, which, fun
fact, is Imperial. In the
end, the cinematography
and editing is wisely
selected and natural
feeling. Despite a con-
fusing ending, the point
of American Factory is
not for everyone to live
happily ever after, nor is
it for everyone to have
their lives ruined by this
factory, it is just to portray
a raw and honest story of
people with lives different
from our own.
