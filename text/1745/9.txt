mperial College is a
world leading univer-
sity, without a doubt
one of the best ones
in the UK, but while that
is the label we all get on
our degree certiﬁcate once
we’re done, what you ex-
perience during your time
here really just depends
on how lucky you got
with the department you
ended up in or the people
you are working with.
Despite studying at
the same institution,
there seems to be little
consistency across
departments in terms of
provision of teaching
materials, feedback
quality or even student
spaces and services. If
you’re a postgraduate
research student, you
need to get twice as
lucky. A bad supervisor
can make your life mis-
erable even if everything
else is great.
Departments will
often defensively insist
that providing something
is simply not possible,
for whatever reason,
while the same might be
standard in other parts
of College. For a lot of
students, support in the
form of good quality
feedback, early release
of timetables, access
to past papers, or even
just a place to buy and
eat your lunch remain a
distant dream.
Most differences
come from the unwill-
ingness to change, or
from a simple lack of
commitment. There
is often an element of
pride involved, with
departments claiming
they can’t release past
paper solutions or
lecture notes because
their subject is just so
special and providing
too much would ruin
the degree programme
forever, even when the
experience of other
departments shows the
opposite.
Not everything is the
departments’ fault, of
course. Sometimes it’s
just really difficult to
advocate for student ex-
perience in an institution
that is run as a business.
It doesn’t matter how
campus costs you half of
your student loan, and
the shuttle bus you were
going to take between
campuses is full for the
third time this week,
you will have few nice
words to say about your
“holistic student experi-
ence”. Again, your per-
ception will be wildly
different depending on
which campus you are at
or what room you won
in the halls lottery.
If you think the
College or the Union are
not aware . Every year,
the College is hit with
the students’ frustration
in the National Student
Survey, a questionnaire
all undergraduate
students are invited to
complete just before
they graduate. A similar
survey is taken by post-
graduate students every
two years.
As the Union, we
produce an “NSS
response” (or a postgrad-
uate equivalent one);
after reading through the
hundreds of comments,
we come up with a set
of recommendations
that we think would fix
these issues, or at least
mitigate them. Parity
of student experience is
often addressed; imple-
menting what is possible
in some departments as
the standard across the
whole College would fix
a lot of problems. After
presenting our little list
of ideas to College, they
usually smile and nod,
approve our plan and…
and that’s where the
efforts often end.
At the top levels, the
College and the Union
are really good at making
plans, but implementing
them has always been a
challenge. The College
(or the Deputy President
- Education) needs to sell
those plans to the facul-
ties and faculty reps who
in turn need to convince
the departments and dep
reps who might end up
implementing them, but
also maybe not. On Col-
lege’s side, little effort
is put into ensuring the
Union recommendations
are followed on depart-
mental level – after all,
those are not their plans
anyway. The Union, on
the other hand, strongly
believes in the potential
of those plans, but lacks
the mechanisms to make
sure change actually
happens; the academic
rep network in its
current state is mostly
dysfunctional, toothless,
and isn’t unified in
action.
If we want to effec-
tively fight for parity of
student experience, we
need to work together
across departments and
faculties; without a
proper rep community,
we remain blissfully
unaware of what could be
improved and are unable
to share good practice.
Without knowing the
people who create these
plans or understanding
the reasoning behind
them, a rep can hardly
put their whole heart in
them and fight for them
on departmental level.
Our strategies need to
be put together by the
whole rep community,
sharing the hard won
knowledge that comes
with experience, not just
individuals at the top.
Better support and
preparation are also
desperately needed.
Currently, the training
for reps is provided too
late and it fails to teach
those that are new to the
role important skills for
doing our job – basics
of effective negotiation,
team management skills,
or even simple stuff like
how to chair a meeting
and what to prepare for
going into one. Even if
I am sold on a plan, it is
of no use if I don’t know
how to sell it further.
We have over a
hundred active reps at
Imperial and they’re
doing a good job, but
unfortunately their full
potential is yet to be
fully unleashed. Until
then, your flatmate’s de-
partment will probably
still be better than yours.
