Spinach andAgushi: Dishing out Massive Warm Hugs
in the Form of Ghanaian Stews
FOOD

I
had the brilliant idea
of suggesting a little
day trip to Portobello
Road Market on the
weekend of storm Dennis.
Low grey storm clouds
hung over normally pic-
turesque Notting Hill that
morning, a dreary back-
drop to the pastel pallor
of characteristic petite
houses. Having lived in
London for half a year
now, gloomy mornings are
something I’ve become
accustomed to, but none
of them were as tenacious
in warning about an immi-
nent downpour.
Icy wind slipped
through the tiniest gaps of
our coats as we made our
way to Portobello Road,
steadily diminishing my
naive optimism for the
clouds to part and for the
tiniest sliver of sunlight to
make its way through. By
the time we approached
the stretch of tented stalls
bearing colourful fresh
produce and whimsical
antique trinkets, my
face and fingers were
numb, simply yearning to
wrap around something,
anything, warm.
Fromadistance,wesaw
billows of steam emerging
from a bright orange tent.
Naturally, our shivering
selves gravitated towards
it, a promise of warmth
and cosiness. Soon
enough, we were staring
at an impressive spread
of massive pots, each
proudly bearing a mouth-
watering, hearty-looking
stew. There was one with
chunks of meat bathed
in a rich orange sauce
that exuded a delicious
peanutty aroma, and
another filled with an
abundance of bright
green spinach immersed
in a fragrant amber stew.
It was truly a sight (and
scent) to behold.
As if the steaming
pans of tantalising stews
weren’t enough, the man
in the tent called out
humourous greetings,
drawing curious passers-
by, including us, closer.
The easy-going vendor
introduced us to the array
of Ghanaian stews before
us, each sounding more
delicious than the last. We
knew we just had to get
something as we watched
him dole out heaping
ladles of hot stew into
rice-filled boxes.
What I love is how
flexible the menu is. You
can get a jollof box with
one stew and jollof rice for
£6-7 or get a combination
box with two stews and
rice for £1 extra. There
are 6 stews to select from
on the permanent menu,
including vegan, chicken,
beef, and fish options, as
well as weekly specials
to keep things fresh. If
you’re indecisive (or just
“It was a much-
needed care
package of
warmth and
colour on that
bleak day”
“Together, the
hearty stews
and jollof
rice simply
nourishes and
warms you
from the inside
out“
plain ravenous), you can
even go for all the stews.
We opted for a fully vegan
combination box with the
signature spinach and
agushi and black-eyed
bean stews, upgrading it
to a large box for another
£1 as we were sharing.
That’s not all, of
course. As we were
ordering, something else
caught my eye: plantains
bubbling away to fried
perfection in a vat of hot
oil. I just couldn’t resist
and added them to our
order. As an accompani-
ment to the combination
box, it costs an additional
£1.50, racking the total up
to £9.50 between the two
of us. If it were just me,
however, a regular-sized
box would be more than
suffice as the portions are
quite generous, making
this a wallet-friendly
lunch option.
The box we received
was glorious to both the
eyes and nose: a bed of
steaming, spiced rice
bound by two fragrant,
orange stews with golden
coins of plantain and
chopped green onions
generously scattered on
top. It was definitely
a much-needed care
package of warmth and
colour on that bleak, chilly
day. My spirits were lifted
from the first bite, and I’m
not even exaggerating.
Just ask my companion; he
can confirm the sustained
expression of delight on
my face as we ate.
For those in the
unknown, agushi (or egusi
as it’s more commonly
known) is the seed of
squash, melon or gourd,
acting as a common in-
gredient in West African
cuisine and is rich in
proteins, fats, vitamins
and minerals. In its ground
form, it is a popular in-
gredient in stews across
West Africa, and here at
Spinach and Agushi, we
sampled a Ghanaian vari-
ation. Despite the layer of
bright red chilli oil on top,
the namesake stew was
not greasy whatsoever
and carried only a mild
spice. It was deliciously
fragrant and brimming
with warm spices, with
the agushi adding sub-
stance and creaminess to
the tender spinach leaves
without weighing you
down. I would even go
so far as to say that even
avid spinach-haters would
enjoy this stew – the leafy
taste is masked by the
how flavourful it is.
The black-eyed bean
stew had a completely dif-
ferent flavour profile, but
was also packed full of
flavour despite being a bit
more watery. The beans
themselves were cooked
nicely, soft and starchy but
not overly mushy, adding
nuttiness and heartiness to
the overall dish. Let’s just
say there’s a (very good)
reason why beans and
rice are eaten together in
so many cuisines. Now, I
don’t know quite enough
about jollof rice to make
a comment about Spinach
and Agushi’s version
(you’d have to go back to
last week’s issue for that),
but it paired beautifully
with the stews, soaking up
every last bit of flavour.
Together, the stews and
rice simply nourish and
warm you from the inside
out.
One more thing: please
don’t skimp on the fried
plantains. As they had
just been freshly pulled
from the frying oil, they
were piping hot, just the
way I like them. The mild
sweetness of the plantains
offers a tasty contrast
to the hearty stews and
savoury rice, providing an
extra dimension in terms
of aesthetics, texture and
taste to the whole box.
To me, they are simply
a must-have accompa-
niment and completely
worth the supplementary
£1.50. We polished off the
whole box, without letting
even a single grain of rice
go to waste, and before it
had a chance to get cold,
a pretty astounding feat
on that freezing street if I
do say so myself. We were
full, not in a heavy, un-
comfortably stuffed kind
of way, but in a content,
energised way.
I’ll be honest: this is
the first time I had actual
West African food, so I
don’t have much expe-
rience on that front, but
this has certainly given
me a more than positive
impression on the cuisine.
It has made me so much
more keen to try out more
regional dishes, and any
food capable of doing that
is amazing in my book. I
would gladly visit weekly
if I had the chance.
Spinach and Agushi has
other stands in Exmouth
(Mondays to Fridays)
and Broadway (Saturdays
only) Markets, as well
as providing delivery
service, but can they set
up a stall at the Tuesday
farmer’s market already?
