Artificial Intelligence: The First Step to Tackling
Antibiotic Resistance?
Artificial it may be, but the benefits of AI are definitely real, as researchers from MIT have identified a powerful
new antibiotic using machine learning

“[...] increasing
numbers of
pathogenic
bacterial
strains develop
resistance to
not only one,
but even all,
antibiotics”
A
rtificial intel-
ligence (AI) is
widely used in
a multitude of
technological, scientific
and business applications,
including automation,
natural language process-
ing and data analytics
to list a few. However,
while it is currently being
used for the analysis of
relationships between
prevention, diagnosis
or treatment techniques
and patient outcomes,
the potential of AI in
medicine has an expanse
of directions in which it
can further develop.
Only last week, re-
searchers from Massachu-
setts Institute of Technol-
ogy (MIT) revealed they
had harnessed the powers
of machine learning to
identify a promising new
antibiotic compound
that can kill many of the
world’s most problematic
disease-causing bacteria.
Importantly, tested in the
laboratory and in two
different mouse models,
the new compound also
worked against those
resistant to all currently
known antibiotics.
The computer model
used in their research, pub-
lished in Cell, can screen
more than 100 million
chemical compounds
in just a few days, and
was designed to identify
potential candidates for
antibiotics that would kill
bacteria using different
mechanisms than those of
existing drugs.
“We wanted to develop
a platform that would
allow us to harness the
power of artificial intel-
ligence to usher in a new
age of antibiotic drug
discovery,” says James
Collins, the Termeer
Professor of Medical
Engineering and Science
in MIT’s Institute for
Medical Engineering and
Science and Department
of Biological Engineer-
ing.
Over the past few
decades, development
of new antibiotics has
stagnated, with most new
treatments being simply
altered variants of existing
drugs. Moreover, the
development of new anti-
biotics is extremely costly
and time consuming, so
the rising capabilities of
AI could significantly
improve drug discovery.
The importance of this
is even greater in the
emerging era of antibiotic
resistance, as increasing
numbers of pathogenic
bacterial strains develop
resistance to not only one,
but multiple, and in some
cases even all, antibiotics.
The concept of usingAI
for this is not new – due
to insufficient accuracy,
earlier AI methods were
not appropriate for use for
in silico drug discovery. In
this study, the researchers
focused on targeting E.
coli, training the model on
around 2,500 molecules,
including around 1,700
FDA-approved drugs
with diverse structure and
function, and tested it on
a library of over 6000
compounds. The molecule
chosen for its strong anti-
bacterial activity, novel
structure and low toxicity
was named halicin, and
was shown to be effective
against virtually every
species tested (including
commonly resistant C.
difficile, and M. tuber-
culosis), bar one lung
pathogen, in laboratory
tests. It was also success-
ful in mice infected with
A. baumanii, a bacterial
strain resistant to all
known antibiotics.
The mechanism by
which halicin is thought
to kill bacteria is through
disruption of the electro-
chemical gradient across
the cell membrane, inhib-
iting adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP) production,
the molecule responsible
for providing vital energy
in cells, thus inducing cell
death. This is difficult to
develop resistance to as
it would require multiple
mutations to combat,
and likely need sustained
evolutionary change, thus
highlighting an area for
further exploration.
In the future, the team
want to examine halicin
further, with hopes of
collaborating with a phar-
maceutical company for
potential use in humans.
The team also identified
eight other promising anti-
bacterial candidates using
this AI model, which will
be tested further in the
future, as well as develop-
ing other functionalities of
the model, such as more
precise targeting of path-
ogenic, but not beneficial,
bacteria in the patients.
It is also hoped that it
will be able to design
new drugs, based on
what it has learned about
the common chemical
structures within drugs
and the effects they have.
Ultimately, it is clear that
AI has come a long way
from playing checkers
and chess to combatting
antibacterial resistance –
and we’re one step closer
to finally catching up.
