I like to go down to the market on saturdays and just buy random old stuﬀ that I don’t really need // Modular
Records
‘Breathe Deeper’ – If
you want to grow as a
person, push your own
limits. You can only
learn through discomfort!
‘Tomorrow’s Dust’ –
don’t dwell on the past,
you’ll be at your most
fabulous living carefree.
“Sympathy for the fauna //
Fragile life in the sauna,”
is Kevin’s take on global
warming. Make of that
what you will.
Parker then finally
realises that life really
isn’t all that bad on ‘On
Track’. Melancholic piano
riffs cut through high-
pitched church organs
and auxiliary synths.
Sometimes the simplest
songs are the most beauti-
ful. Channelling his inner
piano man, Kevin still
manages to make a track
with quintessential Tame
Impala elements, making
this a smoother transition
to piano music than Alex
Turner’s, if somewhat less
exciting.
‘Lost in Yesterday’ is
an unapologetic pop track,
with the Aussie frontman
again taking to dwelling
on his emotional baggage,
and finding solace in the
knowledge that all expe-
riences, regardless of how
they were perceived at the
time, can end up making
you a better person. This
then catapults the album
into his own brand of
lounge disco, on ‘Is It
True’, where he portrays
the uncertainty of fresh
love, perhaps making this
the sister song to ‘Instant
Destiny’.
‘It Might Be Time’
combines piano riffs with
uncomfortable intervals
of the lead synth to make
Kevin’s realisation that
he’s now old especially
sobering. The vocals drop
in and resemble the voices
in your head telling you to
smell the coffee, the same
ones we often try to block
out.
This sets up the perfect
finale but not without a sly
Aussie twist. Kevin treats
us to a two-minute house
beat opened by a random
podcast sample, showing
us his full measure of
self-aware mockery. “You
know how you make
the bass better? Crank
the bass up,” seems out
of place at first. “You
know to make the kick
drum better? Crank the
bass up! It’s like, no, not
really...” I’m sure there’s
a poignant thought about
not trying to fix your
life by overloading one
solution somewhere in
there.
‘One More Hour’ takes
to the brink of the hour
mark for the album. There
are obvious shades of
Supertramp, just as there
have been shades of the
80s throughout the record.
It is rock operetta in a
single track, with crashing
rides and powerful snares,
all to the backdrop of a
flanger out of control.
Evening out the album
stylistically and prevent-
ing anyone from saying
that Tame Impala don’t do
rock anymore, it is a song
that doesn’t really provide
answers, and peters out
with a chorus giving
guidance on how to go on.
How to find love. How to
find life. “All your voices
said you wouldn’t last a
minute, babe // One more
hour and you know your
life is one to share”.
