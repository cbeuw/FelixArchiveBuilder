A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
proactive enough about at
times in the past. We’re
also assessing what is
‘core’, looking at what is
essential from a legal or
constitutional perspective,
from a student-need or
–expectation perspective,
and then what are ‘nice-
to-haves’, things that
are appreciated but not
crucial. We’ll be making
an assessment of how
much money we need
based on that.
Felix will report on the
block grant negotiations
later this term.
Felix: Speaking of the
Managing Director
role, we have a new
interim Managing
Director at the Union.
You work closely with
that person, so what
has your experience
been with them thus
far?
AS: Whenever a new
member of staff is brought
in, there’s always a bit of
nervousness, especially
when that new member is
the most senior member
of staff in the Union.
Graham has completely
assuaged those nerves.
He’s excellent. He takes
the student experience
seriously, he values
the opinions of student
volunteers and sabbatical
officers, he works con-
structively with staff and I
believe those staff respect
him, and he has the right
experience previously to
address the challenges
the Union staff have now.
He knows how to start
helping and start improv-
ing things. He was very
effective at Westminster
student union last year,
and they were in a more
difficult position than we
are now beforehand. I
have no doubt he’s going
to be very effective here.
It’s very helpful for me.
Since his predecessor left,
I’ve been picking up a lot
of the work internal to the
office, and I’ve had to put
some of those things ahead
of work a Union President
would normally be doing.
So it’s a huge relief, being
able to be focus on being
a student representative
first-and-foremost again.
Felix: What kinds of
things are you focus-
sing on?
AS: I’m working on a few
projects right now, includ-
ing on hbar, training for
student volunteers, and
our complaints process.
One of the important
things we have going
right now is a project to
improve access to study
at Imperial for refugees
and asylum-seekers, at the
behest of a PhD student,
Luciana Miu. We’re
collaborating with Ad-
vancement in the College
on this.
Felix: Graham has a
lot of experience at
the NUS, with which
the Imperial student
union has a long and
tumultuous history!
Did that factor in
to your decision to
bring him in?
For reference, Imperial
has joined and left the
NUS multiple times,
despite having been a
founding member, and
currently sits outside of
the NUS after the most
recent student referendum
on the matter in 2008.
AS: The NUS has been a
controversial organisation
for some time, going in
peaks and troughs. We
did ask him about his
experience there in the
HR department, we didn’t
dodge the question, but
we felt his experience
would be helpful – his
involvement with several
student unions and NUS
puts what we do into
a broader context. We
wanted to hire someone
who wanted to do this job
and was able to do it. That
means hiring someone
from the student union
ecosystem, which invari-
ably means it is likely the
person you bring in will
have some NUS affiliation
as most student unions are
members.
Often Imperial, as a
College and as a Union,
will sometimes pretend
it’s on an island in the sky,
not tethered to anything
else. But being connected
to other student unions,
and knowing about some
of the positive things they
are doing – without being
dragged into some of the
less positive things – is
not without value.
We should be doing
that more. In the past
we’ve been completely
unplugged, from national
trends as well as other
unions. But this year,
we’ve been involved
with Wonkhe, which
has allowed us to better
integrate into that via
their whatsapp group,
webinars, one-on-one
chats with their head
every month, and so on.
We’re infinity-percent
more plugged in than we
were before.
Felix: Can you talk
about what Wonkhe
is?
AS: It’s a sort of thinktank
based around higher
education policy. They
do studies and research
for both universities and
student unions.The people
who founded and run it
have more of a student
union background, so they
understand the issues we
face and they care about
a good student experience
at universities. They feed
us information on higher
education policy and
news, catered to student
unions, with features on
new developments or
speculative new trends, or
new legislation. They can
also be commissioned to
do specific pieces of work.
Felix: And finally, for
clarity, none of this
represents a shift
in the Union’s per-
spective towards the
NUS?
AS: No.We were NUS-ag-
nostic. In a different set of
circumstances, without
the controversies and lack
of focus on the big issues,
I might be advocating for
us to be involved in things
at the national level.
There’s a limit to what
any student union at any
university can achieve
by itself; sometimes you
have to push for things
together as part of a larger
group. But I’m not willing
to pull students along into
that when, right now, it
might not benefit them,
and I don’t think there
is an appetite amongst
the student body to get
involved. As it is, we’ve
been starting to look at
other ways of linking up
with other universities.
For example, we had a
sabbatical officer meetup
for sabbs across London
last year.
Felix: What are your
thoughts on Simone
Buitendijk’s depar-
ture for Leeds?
AS: We are really sad to
see her go. Even where
we haven’t agreed with
her 100%, it’s clear that
she has good intentions
and cares deeply about the
student experience – and
especially the holistic
student experience. She’s
really committed to that
vision, where the different
things affecting students,
educational decisions and
financial decisions, are
brought into true align-
ment.
We are obviously nervous
about what happens next.
We hope we have a good
degree of involvement
in the selection of her
successor – and that her
successor shares those
views and is as committed
to seeing through some of
the positive work she has
started on learning and
teaching, and in collab-
oration with the student
union, academics across
different departments, the
Vice-Deans, and so on.
Felix: The Union
Council voted to sup-
port the UCU strikes
at Union Council last
week (see News, Felix
Issue 1744.) Josef
Willsher, a student,
came and presented
a paper mandating
the Union and stu-
dent representatives
to actively lobby the
College in support
of the strikes. That
passed with a mas-
sive 29-1 majority,
with one abstention.
How do you feel per-
sonally feel about the
UCU strikes, and how
do you feel about
this approach that
the Council has man-
dated you to follow?
AS: Firstly, Union
Council voted over-
whelmingly to support the
action. Students are going
to be disrupted by this
action, yes. Council voted
to support the strikes
because the representa-
tives felt that although
students will be disadvan-
taged in the short-term, in
the long-term it is to the
benefit of both current and
future students who want
to become academics that
they are well compensat-
ed, that their grievances
are taken seriously, and
that they are engaged
with meaningfully when
it comes to different ne-
gotiations nationally over
pensions or locally over
pay.
Also, blurring into my
personal view a bit, I
think students felt that
this is part of a general
trend. Over time, having
pension contributions
going up a little bit, the
benefits getting a little
worse, pay going up less
than inflation or not at
all leading to an effective
pay cut. The changes that
were being presented to
pensions in 2018 were
much more fundamental,
which meant it was a
more clear-cut situation.
My personal view is that it
is less clear-cut this time.
It would be more difficult
to make the case for strike
action over the individual
minor change this year
or last year, or the year
before that, and so on. But
those incremental changes
to how staff are valued
and rewarded add up over
time. In the end, staff are
worse off, and so students
are worse off because you
can’t attract good people.
If that sounds familiar,
that’s because it is exactly
what happens to students.
The food prices increase
just a bit above inflation
every year – and the
change from when you
start and end your degree
is huge. Or rent. It’s
one or two things every
year – a facility being
closed, some price being
increased, and so on.
That one little thing might
not be enough to get
people to react, but if you
don’t start saying “no” at
some point, if you don’t
wake up at step one or two
and do something about
it, then suddenly you’re
at step 15 and things are
way worse than they once
were. That’s the pattern
I’ve seen over a number
of years. I don’t think
our predecessors effec-
tively and constructively
challenged the university
– which means that the
experience of someone at
this university ten years
ago had things a lot better,
financially at least, than
someone here now.
The student reps on Union
Council – as they did in
2018 – strongly empathise
with the UCU’s position,
because it is the same one
we are in as students. In
spite of whatever misgiv-
ings we might have about
this particular dispute,
and about the short-term
negative impact on
students, it’s the respon-
sible thing to do. To en-
courage a resolution, and
not to take things at face
value.
