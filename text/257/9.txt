Patrick Rotherham interviews
JOHN RENBOURN
John Renbourn was born in
London 24 years ago. On Wed-
nesday, January 31st, he played
to a packed folk club. His musical
sources are wide ranging—on
Wednesday, his material included
William Byrd's "Lord Salisbury,"
a Jelly Roll Morton Song, and a
piece of modern Indian popular
music. " Lord Salisbury," was
originally written for lute, and
when performing this John was
accompanied by Terry Cox on
glockenspiel; in some other num-
bers Terry also played hand
drums.
Renbourn's great skill with the
guitar is balanced by his easy-
going stage performance. This
was very well received, and, sup-
ported by the regular college
players, made for a successful
evening.
During the interval he spoke
to Pat Rotherham.
John, how long have you been
paying guitar?
I've had a guitar since Chas
MacDevitt was in the hit parade,
whenever that was, but I've been
playing in London for three or
four years now, as a professional
folk singer. You change and you
get better suddenly; particularly
through hearing Davy Graham
playing. I first started playing
blues when I first came up to
London, Davy was around; and
if you could hear him, you'd learn
a lot. I didn't really intend to be
a folk singer; I just happened to
be playing the guitar, and hap-
pened to get a few bookings; now
I'm getting a fair amount of work
as a folk singer. But I don't stop
and say this is me, my job. I can
remember when I started playing.
It wasn't like starting and getting
better, and earning more money;
it was just having a play, which is
more or less what I'm still doing.
Did you luive any musical
education?
I did music in school, and used
to sing once in a while. I think
I'm well up in music but I'm not,
unfortunately.
Did you ever plan to do any-
thing else?
Yes, I went to art school, for a
short period. I was going to be
the greatest artist the world has
ever known, but that seemed to
fall through. You've got to keep
a lot of things going, you can't
just do one thing. If you've got
no fixed plans you're not brought
down when you don't make it.
You mentioned Davy Graham
av an influence on you—what
others have there been?
Guitar players? Naturally
I've got mv favourites, but whe-
ther they influence you or not is
another matter.
Favourites then?
It goes in bands. I like a lot of
medieval music. Have you heard
Guillaume de Machaut, a French
composer?
Only of Palestrina
This guy was writing about two
centuries before him, writing
three part things—he was the
first guy to write a full mass. It's
unbelievable, beautiful. There's
a lot of guys on the jazz scene
who play music I like. I like
Charles Lloyd, Ornette Coleman.
Naturally Muddy Waters, people
like that.
The Americans seem to be
ahead of us in many fields. Do
you think this is so in folk?
Not really. Naturally they are
in things which we imitate. I
mean, I'm nowhere as a blues
guitarist compared to real blues
musicians. But there's a lot of
music in England, like traditional
music, which goes on in other
forms of music, Benjamin Britten,
people like that. I think this

stamps British music. Maybe
the influence will continue, and
say in a hundred years time peo-
ple will be writing symphonies
with electric guitar, as an English
instrument. Does that make
sense?
Could you tell me about the
group you're in, the Pentangle?
There's Bert Jansch, Jacqui
MacShee, Terry Cox, who played
tonight, and Danny Thomson on
bass. Danny's one of the new
heads on the jazz scene. It's very
hard to get into the jazz scene,
and suddenly he's got recognised.
He's very free, he's interested in
folk ideas as well.
You play regularly in London?
Yes, at the Horseshoe in Tot-
tenham Court Road, every Sun-
day.
What do you play?
It's a mixture of five people
with five ideas going at once; but
we all start off on mutual ground.
Blues is common to both scenes,
so we play a few blues : but
mostly either blues-based, or
numbers I've written with Bert,
or that he's written in his style,
which become mixed; and the
bass line's been added. There's
a lot of free playing—come do.vn
sometime.
/ mean to. Now, this evening
you've played Byrd and an Indian
piece. Do you go much to other
types of music?
I play anything I particularly
dig. But they all come into my
idea of playing the guitar whether
it's raga music or anything. I
don't plav Indian music, I play
guitar, a bit of that, a bit of some-
thing else. I've got a few things
going, writing for other instru-
ments. I did a thing for oboe,
and that took a lone time to write
down. I like the idea of writing
for parts. That's mv present in-
terest, just to use the guitar as
one or two lines, as a feature
instrument. The stuff I play is
an attempt to play everything at
once, which is idiotic . It should
be one line, with say viole, re-
corder, oboe.
Folk music is often connected
with being on the road. Have you
travelled much?
That was a long time ago!
I've not travelled as much as
Woody Guthrie. I've just been
to France and Cornwall.
Do you write when you're on
the road?
I think it's a tremendous scene,
because you feel you're really on
your own, with no strain, you can
go anywhere you like. You sit
down you may as well play. - If
it's a nice day you play better, if
you've met someone nice you
play better still. Most of the
stuff I've worked out has been
done when I've been in such a
ridiculous easy situation, at a
good place. It reflects, you feel
like playing.
Have you got any LP's coming
out?
I've got one half finished.
There's this thing I mentioned
with parts. I've got this guy
looking at it, to make sure all the
notes are there, that it's present-
able for other musicians. If he
thinks it's okay, we'll get some
musicians together and try it.
The record should be out in about
three months time.
Do you have a free hand with
recordings then?
Yes, Transatlantic's a small
company; it's a folk label and
they don't mind what you do.
The records sell to a folk audi-
ence, and you can play exactly
what you want to do. You
couldn't with
Lastly, hav
the future?
Well, I'll

We regret to announce the death of Colcuft, who fell from the
top of his tower just after writing the letter published on page 4.
Few tears need be shed at his passing, since he has in the past be-
fa/llera similar fates (usually at the end of a session due to overce-
lebration of the end of his exams) and each time been reincarnated
inj a different form. Until his return his duties will be taken over
by Andy Jordan. last week would belong to another
I had of course got it wrong. I age. The Flippant equation for
had expected Ray Flippant to student grants is
start the Union meeting of two
weeks back with a discourse on
invisible students. It turned out
to be Ray Phillips on disguised
students : those who are some-
where in between. A few more
to add to the range. And the
range of IC students is sometimes
amazing. PG's here have between
them around 500 kids: civil en-
gineers are a particularly prolific
lot. There are explanations but
perhaps they all failed on dams.
But why don't we have a few
invisible students? " Mr. X, an
unknown and unseen member of
IC, was last week elected ICU
president by a unanimous council.
Members of council claimed to
know the other candidates well
enough to have had to vote for
X." So Felix in the summer.
" Ian Balls, a minor president,
said " This just goes to prove that
council knows best for the
Union." When asked " Which
Union?", Balls said " Mine, of
course."
It was indeed fascinating to
watch members of the executive
get up to nrotect their authority.
" Council knows the candidates "
was the continuing theme. Which
explains whv the Union doesn't
know the candidates. Perhaps
Plato's oligarchy would have en-
joyed their authority too. But
most of us find things Platonic
frustrating.
Wiiat would be the difference
to the Union if Mr. X did get
elected? Very little to most
students who rarely see their
president anyway. If IC students
had to elect their president, it
would probably mean that more
would know who he was. " Who
is Ray Phillips anyway?" pro-
bably meant nothing to quite a
number of students.
And after the endless argu-
ments about apathy, it might in-
duce a certain amount of interest.
Candidates would have to appeal
to the electorate (!) and would
have to understand the student
body. The frippery of Flippant
at the student finance meeting
Grant x Quality of student
= constant.
Remarkable mathematics from
a scientist. Rob Collinge had
pointed in this meeting to the sur-
vey shewing that around 5 per
cent of IC undergraduates are
getting more than £30 less than
their proper grant. It is not sur-
prising that students are apa-
thetic when their representatives
seem to be apathetic towards
them.
So unfortunately IC Union re-
jected the suggestion that it is
competent to select its senior rep-
resentative. But who is likely to
be the next President? The
obvious candidates are those al-
ready on council. Chris O'Don-
nell says he won't be here. Bob
Macknian has afinitechance, he
says, of coming back; but in typi-
cal style he refused to commit
himself on the Presidency. With
striking honesty, Martin Lack
doesn't know if he will be back
but " I don't know if I could do
it." Jane Pearson hasn't even
got round to considering it. Rex
Lowin says definitely " No."
Somebody else who won't be
around is Barbara Hedge but
she said " I shall stand. I mean,
it doesn't say anywhere that you
have to be here for it." And will
Keith Guy stand for a third time?
We shall have to wait and see.
The only outside candidate men-
tioned to date—Paul Bradley—
may not be back, but is consider-
ing standing for the presidency
and " will definitely stand for
council.'" Neither is this my bid.
And why, you ask, am I asking
this question now? Because it
seems rational to have the demo-
cratic elections in this term like
other universities; then we
wouldn't have the problem of the
elections interfering with exams.
A staff-member is quoted as
havine said recently that " union
politicians are either insatiably
ambitious or retarded adoles-
cents." Next year's president will
probably have to be insatiably
adolescent.

Alexis Korner appeared at I.C.
on Friday 2nd of February.
Earlier the same week John Ren-
bourn was on at the folk club,
and it was interesting to compare,
the styles of the two. Interesting
in that there is little con-,?a~:?C" |
at all, as they use comp!et£;/ d::- *
ferent techniques of guitar play-
ing. Renbourn as fairly Wflii |
known, while Kornc plays mostly
Blues, and uses an electric guitar
With this he produces sounds
impossible to obtain or. an ?cou-
stir, "titer, and can play faster.
