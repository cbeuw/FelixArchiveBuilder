If you live in Hall on a large industrial grant, have no children
and don't drink coffee, then there's nothing. On the other hand you
may have interests in grants, coffee bars, lodgings and nurseries.
If so there is plenty in it for you. Since the individual cannot advance
his interests in these matters himself, he may wonder who can.
For several years there has been someone somewhere who has
been responsible for, or concerned with, student welfare but only this
year has there been anything positive to show for it. Rex Lowin
this year's welfare officer set about his task with enthusiasm unusual
for a member of council and formed a welfare committee of equally
keen and concerned students. This committee, though still unofficial
and therefore able to act only as an advising body with no clearly
defined duties, looks after the important issues that no-one else
is able or wishes to handle.

Have you ever desired a bite to
eat or perhaps a drink of a non-
intoxicating nature whilst in col-
lege between the hours of last
Mooney and bed ? Those who
have, and they are numerous,
have all been thwarted by
Mooney's conservative arrange-
ments A coffee bar was set up
in Southside before it became the
social centre it is now, but it was
a big flop. This has unfortunately
convinced the authorities that
such a facility is not required.
Contrary to this the welfare com-
mittee believes there is a demand
for a focal point other than the
bars, which could easilv take t!
ie
form of a coffee bar. The com-
mittee suggests that the South-
side snack bar should be open
from jnid-afternoon until 11 p.m.
to sell coSee, hot pies and any
other food for which there is a
demand. They point out that it
could easily be run by students,
except perhaps on Saturdays
when paid staff could be em-
ployed. These proposals are
being put before the refectories
committee in the hope that they
will take action on them. If they
do IC could well end up with a
very popular coffee bar, a wel-
come thought.
N u r s e r y
A need which has been par-
tially satisfied by the welfare
committee is that of a nursery
for married students. Difficulty
has been encountered in pursuing
such a project because there is
no means of telling how great the
demand for such a nursery will
be. As yet there is no list of
married students at IC available,
so the welfare committee cannot
contact the people who will pro-
vide the demand. A temporary
arrangement has been made with
RCA for IC to share their nur-
sery at a very modest charge
This service is open to any mar-
ried student or member of staff
but the response has been slow.
When the availability of a nur-
sery is made known it is hoped
that more people will take ad-
vantage of it, with the possible
result of persuading the college
authorities to provide a room in
IC expressly for the nursery.
Meanwhile the welfare committee
is concentrating on sorting out
the formalities of running a nur-
sery and is pressing the registry
to compile a list of married
students.
G r a n t s
Of more concern to the ma-
jority of FELIX readers is the
students' grants controversy
which has hit the headlines re-
cently. The welfare committee
seem to have taken over from the
political societies in thisfieldand
have done a tremendous amount
of research into the subject, not
only of grants but of student
finance in general. A survey was
conducted last term to investi-
gate where students' money
comes from and goes to. The
report drawn up from the survey
concluded that the means test
works satisfactorily in practice,
a blow to the student wages sup-
porters, since all undergraduates
get at least the major part of
their grant and it stressed that a
'policy of reducing the cost of liv-
ing for students was preferable
on a long term basis to increasing
their grants. The obvious way of
reducing the cost of living is to
reduce the rents charged for
accommodation ; this can be
achieved by means of the Rent
Tribunal. There are many legal
wrangles involved which are be-
ing investigated by the commit-
tee and if the outcome of the in-
vestigations is favourable the
student may well find himself in
the happy position of paying a
reasonable rent.
A c c o m m o d a t i o n
Student houses have also been
a major concern of the welfare
committee but unfortunately cir-
cumstances have taken the re-
sponsibility for their promotion
out of the committee's hands and
they have lost touch with the
situation. However the welfare
committee can take the credit for
getting the idea of student houses
into practice. There is also a
move afoot to provide an accom-
modation bureau in West Lon-
don in an attempt to relieve the
overworked ULU bureau and to
provide students in the area with
a local service.
E x p a n s i o n
This is an outline of the major
fields of operation of the welfare
committee, seven very active
people who are concerned about
students. Their future plans in-
clude a review of the college
health facilities with the aim of
making students more aware of
the service available to them. It
seems strange that a committee
which is handling investigations
of such general concern as the
welfare committee should be un-
official and so little known. It
is hoped that the next Union
meeting will be quorate so a
motion can be passed rectifying
the situation. Whether this is
achieved or not it can be assumed
that the committee will handle
any problems concerning student
welfare in an extremely compe-
tent manner.

THE F A C T S O F
L I F E
The External Affairs Commit-
tee is a somewhat smaller body
than its Welfare counterpart. It
consists of six members, its chair-
man being the pert near-blonde
Barbara Hedge. What is it con
cerncd v. ith ? External Affairs.
To be more specific, the com-
mittee has two major eggs in its
basket, and a number of minor
ones. Its primary concern at the
moment is with the proposed cut
in grants increase. Assuming all
goes well yesterday's Union
meeting should have seen the
relevant signs of action in a mo-
tion seeking at least partial re-
mission from the economic axe.
While it accepts that, given the
present nationalfinancialcrisis, a
degree of economic stringency is
necessary, it points out that Lon-
don students away from home
will suffer to a greater extent than
most while i the Government's
plan to cut the recommended
grants rise by half will reduce the
student's income to below the
previously commonly accepted
value of 1961, this with respect to
the current cost of living. The
motion backs up its argument
with detail from the Collinge re-
port on student financial hard-
ship, and its plea is intended for
the Secretary of State for Edu-
cation in the form of a letter.
F o l l o w u p
"This letter must be only the
start," said Barbara Hedge. " We
intend constructive action to fol-
low it." Indeed it looks as if this
should be the case. Last year the
committee did little, spent most
ot its time arguing within itself,
and told the Union next to no-
thing about its movements. This
year there is a set (handpicked)
committee holding frequent
meetings. As well as stirring
about grants, it has done a good
deal in the field of " reciprocal
facilities" with the Royal Col-
lege of Art. Furthermore the re-
sults will be publicized. In simple
terms : we can now join RCA
clubs provided they agree to it,
and students at RCA can join
ours under similar conditions.
Furthermore, and this is appar-
ently better than it sounds, we can
eat in their refectories at certain
hours of the day. The recom-
mended clubs in RCA are the
Literary Soc. and the Music soc;
the food is claimed to be as good
as, if not better than Mooney.
Personally, 1 hope that this too is
only the start. The more contact
I.C. has with RCA, the better.
P r e s s R e l a t i o n s
Apart from these two major
issues, the committee has ar-
ranged, or is about to arrange,
a number of other less important
matters. To give examples : a
system of releasing I.C. news to
the national press has been
worked out; and student conces-
sions in the area are now being
investigated.
I d e a s W a n t e d
Like so many organizations in
I.C. the External Affairs commit-
tee can use ideas and enthusiasm
from the rest of the Union. If
you have any bees in your bonnet
that vou consider relevant, see a
member of the committee. You
have a wide choice : from the
chairman, Barbara Hedse (Beit)
to Chris Eriksson (Falmouth),
Stew Barnes and Pete Ruhemann
(Beit), Vinod Garga, or Mike
Edwards. John Sammer

COMMITTEE
The easiest way to understand
the working of the Union is to
study the accompanying dia-
gram. It shows that the most
important body is the General
Meeting of the Union, and it is
here that the members can voice
their ideas and here that all major
policy decisions are made.
The management of the Union
is done by Council, whose mem-
bers will be mentioned later. They
carry out the wishes of the Union
and see that it is running
smoothly. Council has a number
of sub-committees which are re-
sponsible to Council and report
to it at each meeting. Probably
the most important sub-commit-
tee is the Executive consisting of
the President, his Deputy, the
Secretary and the 3 Vice Presi-
dents (Constituent College Presi-
dents) which concerns itself With
domestic matters and mat^s of
great urgency. It normally meets
once a week in term time. The
most vital committees to the club
structure of IC are the Athletic
Clubs, Social Clubs and Recrea-
ional Clubs Committees. The
objects of each are to control the
activities of the clubs which con-
stitute it, allocate money and the
chairman represents its interests
on Council. ICWA's function is
best known to its members and is
represented on Council by its
President.
Each constituent college is rep-
resented on Council by one mem-
ber in addition to the President.
There are six Council members
elected from the floor of the
Union. The purpose is to make
sure that Council does not forget
its ultimate responsibility to the
Lfnion and to represent individu-
als. In the near future they intend
to keep office hours when any-
one will be able to discuss Union
matters with them. The students'
representative on the Halls of
K'e;i'.n-r..v Committee is also a
Couucl' sner/uxi. >

Council has three Old Students'
representatives, one from the old
students' organisation of each
constituent college and an Honor-
ary Treasurer all of whom are
non-students.
Two sub-committees are jiot
officially represented on Council;
thev are the Wejfare and External
Affairs Committees. This position
however, is being rectified.
