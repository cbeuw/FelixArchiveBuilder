LC had two entries in th's
year's ULU One-Act Phy Festi
val last week. Our main entry
was "Little Brother, Little Sis-
ter," by David Compton. It is
set on 15th April, 2001, in a
bomb-shelter anil spotlight:; the
end of "childhood innocence"
for Madam and Sir, the twenty-
odd year old brother and ssier
who have been brought up there
by " Cook." Combining eleme.it,
of tragedy, comedy and romance,
the play gives detailed studies of
the three characters. Lesley
Slater as " Madam" was out-
standing in a part ranging from
petulant child to nearly a full se-
duction of her brother, played by
John Go!der.
John superbly played " Sir"
and throughout 1 had the sense of
a rapidly developing character,
from a sister-dominated juvenile
who wanted to be a good boy to
the climax where he has a love
scene with Cook, played by Roger
Haines.
Cook has some of the funniest
lines, the best occuring early on
when she has found the two
" children " " playing " and hav-
ing said that their mo'.her and
father would have been horrified,
is asked " What are mothers and
fathers?" Cook's answer is
" What you'll be if you're not
careful." Beginning as a heroine,
bringing up two children under
impossible conditions, Cook
changes into somewhat of the
" Brutal stepmother." imposing
obedience by fear of being fed
through the mincing machine to
make rissoles if Sir and Madam
so much as try to open the door
behind the door.
It is as Cook is about to behead
Madam with an exceedingly
nasty-looking meat cleaver that
Sir " makes love " to her. The re-
sult is she dies of a broken heart,
leaving the curtain to fall as bro-
ther and sister finally open the
door and go out.
The Freshers' entry was N.F.
Simpson's " The Hole." This
play concerns the legion events to
be imagined from contemplating
a common or garden hole in the
road. Tim Foster as the vision-
arv. scorned by the others for
failing to share the common
view was the outstanding
character, always managing to ap-
pear natural and belonging there
during his long silences—a diffi-
cult task which no other entry on
the first two nights succeeded in
when their scripts called for it.
At the time of writing the re-
sults are not known (see Late
News) but of the six plays so far
performed, 1 place IC first and
third.

There are
no jobs at BAC
ONLY CAREERS
Careers, yes—and career training recognised throughout the world as the best in the aerospace
business. But don't join BAC a all you want is just a job.
Join us if you want to get wholeheartedly involved in a genuinely international industry
which, technically, has to move faster and farther than most other industries. Join us if you
want to be part of a team which has proved its technical and commercial strength by winning
overseas orders worth over £150,000,000 in three years, in head-on competition with the
biggest USA companies.
Your first post in industry has to be more than a job : it's going to shape your future. At
the least, if you are the kind of person we want, you will demand that it gives you continuity
of interest, a chance to develop and progress.
You will get all that at BAC. Our present programme ranges from the world's first supersonic
airliner through high-performance military aircraft, subsonic jets and defence missile systems
to spacecraft, space instrumentation and products for industry at large. Some we are doing
in collaboration with European companies, some on our own. All are aimed at world markets.
But, at BAC, you will be involved with the future rather than the present. We are constantly
probing ahead, through advanced research programmes. Vast markets beckon. We intend
that BAC and Britain shall have a large share of this future business. That's why we need
people like you—people to whom it won't be ju.t a job.
