THE COLLEGE
BLOCK
Science Museu
Library
A model of how the College Block and Queen's
Tower will look when work is completed
The construction going on be-
hind the Electrical Engineering
building appears today as just
another faceless shell, but when
completed in the midsummer of
1969 it will become the main-
spring in the affairs of the College.
The building is divided into
three main sections; the College
block itself, the College Library
and the Science Museum library.
The Science Museum library will
be on levels 0-3 of part of the
new building opposite Bio-
chemistry. Most of the books will
be kept in closed access racks on

the first two floors and most of
the open shelves are on level 3.
The reading room will be on level
2. The College library will be on
5 levels because while the number
of books it has is less than half of
the Science Museum's collection
a larger proportion will be on
open access, with reading rooms
on each level. It will house books
now kept in the Haldane and
Lyon Playfair libraries.
The focal point of the College
Block itself will be the Great Hall,
which will have a flat floor and a
balcony. It has not yet been de-
cided if this will be available for
informal dances, but as it is twice
the size of the Concert Hall it
would not be full too often.
Above the Hall, on level 5 will be
two large lecture theatres for
about 150 people each. On level
1 will be a large cafeteria for staff
and students. Adjacent to it will
be a S.C.R. The bie<zest error in
planning is on level 2 which \i di-
vided between the staff and stu-
dent common rooms with a
buttery between them. The Staff
Common Room is divided into
several small sections while.the
Students Common Room is just
one large room 70ft. by 120ft. or
about half the size of Beit Quad
—it has already been labelled "For
the Use of the Faceless Ones."
Unless informal dances or some
similar events are held in there,
the air conditioning plant will be-
come quite redundant. Above
will be the Registry on level 3,
the Finance office on level 4 and
the Rector's suite of offices on
level 5.
Maths to Move
The completion of the College
block will certainly bring a sigh of
relief from the Maths department
for it will give the signal to de-
molish the Registry, the Lyon
Playfair library and associated
buildings and to start the con- j
struction of the long-awaited |
mathematics Block. The delay
has not been due to any reluc-
tance on the planning side but
rather to the question of space;
for until there is somewhere to
accomodate the books at present
in the Playfair library and suitable
offices found for the administra-
tive staff their present quarters
must remain. This is not the first
time that this type of problem has
arisen. The Mechanical Engine-
ering block for instance had to be
built in sections in order to main-
tain some continuity of academic
study. This of course delayed the
rate of building and is just one
of the penalties of having a Col-
lege in London.
Other Developments
For the future we can expect to
see Linstead Hall open by early
summer, the Sports centre some-
what later and the Maths Block
by 1971. Eventually the whole of
Princes Gardens is scheduled for
new Halls of Residence if and
when funds become available.
Thoughts for
the Week
One of the main functions of
ICWA is " to safeguard and ad-
vance the interests of women stu-
dents of Imperial College." All
that is required is a short booklet,
to be issued to all girls on
Freshers' Day, called " A Guide
to the I.C. Male." This could
take the form of a dictionary or
phrase-book, giving the true
meanings of phrases such as
"come up for coffee"
There could then follow a sec-
tion giving a short summary of
the main species of the I.C. Male.
Suggested headings are : —
The pure scientist"
" The impure scientist "
" The Weed (Marks I and II)"
ICWArian should be instructed
how to recognise, attract the at-
tention of and, if necessary,
escape from each type. If she is
uncertain how fast he is and there-
fore uncertain of her own posi-
tion, it may be useful to invoke
the uncertainty principle :
dx.m b .dv=b
dx = uncertainty in girl's
position
m b = mass of boy
dv = uncertainty in speed of boy
= Planck's constant
1.054 x 10 -34 joule-sec
If this fails, there is always the
golden rule : if he is irresistible,
yes; if not, no.

PROGRESS
Companies with long experience of employing graduates have now come
to recognise that the graduate, at the beginning of his career in industry,
is anxious to get down to a worthwhile job and do it well. At the same
time he needs quickly to gain an insight into the broad activities of the
company he joins; an introduction to business methods generally; and
to have the prospect of further training and development in the future.
Finally, he wishes to be assured that his future career is not necessarily
confined to the department that he first joined, but that he will be
considered for movement into other
spheres for which he is suitable
and which offer a further prospect to him. Boots recognise these
fundamental feature- in the rarer; dcveloptttisxnt of graduates.
Representatives of the Company will visit your University on 4 March 1968.
