ADJOURNED UNION
MEETING INQUORATE
The posters in red and green all
over Southside and the Union,
were mistaken. " In its second
great week ! — the crazy world
of I.C.'s (quorate) Union meet-
ing " . . . no. Two attempts
were made to restart the original
(adjourned) meeting. The last
elfort, on Thursday, raised a bare
150 people. 300 are needed for
quoracy ; without this no motions
can be passed and no decisions
taken. As the faithful trickled in
they were handed two typewritten
foolscap sheets each—copies of the
marathon motion, due to be pro-
posed by Derek Boothman and
Spooks Duckett, that could ex-
tensively change the Union struc-
ture. More correctly, it is seven
motions in one—each to be separ-
ately debated. Five minutes later,
all, or nearly all, the sheets had
been handed back.
President Ray Phillips made a
short speech before he closed the
meeting. He blamed "poor pub-
licity " for the meagre attendance,
and added that he would tell Con-
stituent College publicists to back
up the campaign to make ths next
Union meeting quorate. In all
fairness, however, the publicity
both for this meeting and for this
-Business deferred
term has been good, with full
colour posters over most of the
college. As Union Publicist Dick
Gentle pointed out, last year it
was virtually non-existent and at-
tendances were perhaps a little
better. " It's very easy to blame
pub'icity," he said, " but I'm not
so sure. . . . The content a
Union meeting just isn't interest-
ing to most of I.C." It's unfor-
tunate but verv true—and if you
were among the 150 faithful in-
terested enough to want to talk
constitutional changes last Thurs-
day, that's too bad.

IC HEARS NUS AND
RSA ON GRANTS
About 100 IC students attended a meeting of the Political
Societies Council on " Student Finance " last Tuesday lunchtime in
a vain attempt to gain enlightenment on the problem of the pro-
posed cut in the grants increase.
Leon Kreitzmann, a Vice-President of the National Union of
Students (Geoff Martin, the President, who was to have spoken was
unavailable) and Jan Midwinter of the Radical Students' Alliance
spoke both about their respective organisations' attitudes to the grants
cut and about their long-term aims in this field. The meeting was
slightly spoiled by Miss Midwinter's tendency to score points off NUS
at every opportunity.
NUS View
Leon Kreitzmann spoke first
and immediately made the point
that grants have not gone up in
amounts comparable to the rise
in the cost of living for several
years. At the moment an Advis-
ory Panel on Student Awards is
completing a report, which should
determine an increase in the level
of grants for the next three years
and will be published towards the
end of May. However, the Go-
vernment have already announced
that in the light of the present
economic situation the presumed
increase will be slashed by 50 per
cent. To express the Govern-
mental and NUS attitudes to this
cut and to other aspects of the
grants situation, Mr. Kreitzmann
gave a brief resume of a recent
NUS meeting with Patrick Gor-
don Walker, the Minister directly
responsible for student affairs.
NUS told Gordon Walker that
they hoped the cut would only be
for one year after which the full
value of the award would be paid,
and also mentioned that they
would like to see an automatic
cost-of-living review index which
would review student grants along
with the cost of living. Gordon
Walker was not keen on the re-
view index and said that as he
didn't know whether the eco-
nomic policy would work this
year (sic) he was not going to be
tied down to giving a specific date
for abolishing the 50 per cent cut.
NUS then mentioned that a freeze
on hall, lodgings and refectory
prices might help if the cut went
through, to which the Minister
Jan Midwinter and Leon Kreiti
mann
replied that he might approach
the University Grants Committee
about this, but he did not sound
over-keen. Finally he said that he
might be prepared to change the
means test so that the maximum
grant would be paid for parental
incomes up to £1,100 instead of
up to £700 as at present. He also
dropped in a quick comment
about a possible "Hardship
Fund " for the really struggling
students.
Leon Kreitzmann believes that
half the battle will be won if stu-
dents were made aware of their
position in society and their prob-
lems and if, correspondingly, the
general public could be educated
as to why they should spend
money on higher education. The
NUS action on the grants cuts will
be to publicise student opinion on
them in the press and by. writing
to MP's hoping to get a parlia-
mentary debate so they can de-
monstrate to Gordon Walker
when they meet him again in
March (a rally will be held on
March 3rd in Trafalgar Square)
that a united student body is lined
up against him. Then towards
the end of May, when the halved
award is announced, they |may
have to try something else.
Meanwhile, he asks that stu-
dents facing hardship while on a
maximum grant should write to
NUS and explain their difficulties.
In arguing with the minister. NUS
seems to have no difficulty in
showing that when oarents fail to
pav their contribution, a student
often has to struggle, but thev
have no evidence to prove that
students receiving a maximum
grant are hard up. which is em-
barrassing.
RSA Line
Jan Midwinter then outlined
the RSA policy on student finance,
which is to receive a definite wage
for all students. This, she feels,
is merely asking for equal status
with the working members of the
community. R.S.A, in the in-
terim, opposes outright any cuts
in grants and supports unflinch-
ingly any action to counter the
Government's " outragous poli-
cies." After saying this she
seemed to spend most of her time
vilifying the NUS line and saying
nothing constructive herself. How-
ever, after a quick interruption by
Chris O'Donnell, she mentioned
that RSA were supporting the Art
Colleges Parliamentary lobby in
March and were sanctioning a
National Day of Student Activity
on May 1 st to show where student
opinion lies on the grants issue.
Questions and comments from
the audience included Rob Col-
linge's claim, backed up by his
report on student grants, that
students on average were not suf-
fering hardship, a completely ir-
relevant speech by Ray Phillips to
add to the general rude rumblings
by members of the Exec, and
Council throughout the meeting,
and the view of Les Ebdon,
Chairman of Soc Soc, that NUS
should link its action on grants
into a larger framework of action
on cuts in all social services.
Kreitzman replied to Ebdon that
NUS had not got the majority of
students behind them and tnai
they would have to gain the sup-
port of the students who accept
a second class status in the world,
before they could achieve any-
thing.

Albert Hall Concert Saved
With bare seconds to spare
before cancellation charges bejan
to bite deep into Carnival's juicy
kitty, Chris Palmer, dynamic
organiser, finally announced that
he had definitely booked the sen-
sational Donovan for Carnival's
Albert Hall concert, March 81th.
The fee?-—a staggering £1000.
It had earlier been hoped that
Donovan would perform for free
—but no dice. Nevertheless, this
massive total may later be re-
duced. Also appearing on the
bill, on an expenses-only basis,
are the self-styled Incredible
String Band and the coming new
mind-blowers Tyrannosaurus Rex.
The show is to be compered by
the One-der-ful DJ John Peel.
Ever since his first chart entry
with " Catch the Wind " Dono-
van has only enhanced his repu-
tation with such biggies as " Sun-
shine Superman " and " Mellow
Yellow." His new double-album
set is currently breaking big in the
States. For his set in the Albert
Hall, Donovan will be backed by
a King-sized orchestra.
The two-man Incredible String
Band are also bill-toppers in their
BLOODY
MARVELLOUS
Last Thursday lunchtime,
three of the four B-negative
donors in the OSS Emergency
Blood Scheme gave a pint oftheir
blood at the College Health Cen-
tre, bringing the total amount
given under the scheme to 29
pints or over 3 gallons.
The donors ass urged to rest for
~0 miuultd aiterwards to avoui
fainting, but on this occasion it
was the OSS helper who nearly
passed out, being unused to
writing names on polythene bags
of warm blood!

folk world on its head with their
" Layers of the Onion" LP.
Tyrannosaurus Rex, plugged like
crazy in John Peel's P^effumed
Garden column in International
Times are rumoured to be the
" newthing " group, turned down
by recording comoanies for being
too " uncommercial " and " pro-
gressive." It should make an in-
teresting act.
Altogether, what a knockout
show! Events like this can onlv
boost Carnival to a record-break-
ing all-time high. Right now.
Carnival total stands at £2,300;
Chris Palmer hopes to pull £1000
out of the concert.
SCRUTINY
REINCARNATED
Despite the reported death of
Scrutiny last term the Huxley
Society intends producing an edi-
tion of the magazine this term.
The main theme of this term's
edition is "Humanism and Poli-
tics " with four articles written by
chairmen of IC Political Societies.
Articles on drugs, sex and cos-
mology will also be included. All
the articles are written by mem-
bers of the Huxley Society.
The magazine will provide a
forum for philosophical and social
comment in the college.
