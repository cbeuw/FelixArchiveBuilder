OF THE
STATE
IC UNION
Last Thursday saw the second unsuccessful attempt to continue the only quorate
Union Meeting of the session. It seems a little difficult to understand why it is
impossible to attract a little over 8% of IC's students to a meeting which was
to discuss grants. . . . . . . . . «
_
Ray Phillip's plea that this second failiure was due to bad publicity may be
valid, but wfiat is probably more valid is that people do not know what the
Union does and see no reason to attend.
In this supplement FELIX has attempted to show what the Union does for
you, how it spends its money and how its President sees it. In addition two mem-
bers of Council have written suggesting improvements in the Union, and there
is a 'rogues gallery'of the more important people in the Union. It is hoped that
this wiH help to make the next Union Meeting quorate.
a president's
eye view
In order to get the view of the President on the Union and to
gather some information on wliat the President's job entails FELIX
interviewed Ray Phillips.
The President began by making the statement that in his view
he is fortunate in having the constituent college system, which took
most of the work on academic matters off ICU on to the constituent
college unions. This leaves him with overall administrative problems
involving the Union and College as a whole.
What do you consider to be the job of the President and what
should be the relationship between the Union, Council and President ?
He considers that the most im
portant part of his job is in co-
ordinating with the administration
of the College. As chairman of
Council he does not think that he
should necessarily be completely
impartial, since the president is in
i position to know more about a
lot of matters put before Council
than other members. As chair-
man of Union meetings he tries
to be much more impartial and
tries to see that minority view-
points are expressed.
Do you work to any broad poli-
cies in how you carry out your
job?
He said that he tries to repre-
sent what he considers to be the
students' interests as realistically
as possible, tries not to let peo-
ple's excessive enthusiasm take
precedence over practicability
and to keep an open mind.
To what extent should the Presi-
dent act on his own initiative ?
As far as possible he tries to
represent the students' viewpoint
as he interprets it. If he receives
a letter addressed to him as Presi-
dent, asking for his ideas in the
light of his experience he ans-
wers as he thinks the students
would want him to. Sometimes
quick action is necessary when it
is not possible to consult people
beforehand. This is one of the
things for which he was elected.
Do you think there is enough
communication between the grass
roots of the Union, Council and
the executive ?
" In a word—no." The execu-
tive is only a sub-committee of
Council and reports on what ac-
tion it has taken to Council at
each meeting. The executive com-
mittee itself is not necessarily a
powerful body, but the executive
has power because it is composed
of people with power. If, for
instance, the Welfare Committee
were composed of powerful peo-
ple then it, too, would be a
powerful body in the Union.
He sees no problem of com-
munication between the executive
and Council, but thinks the main
one is that of communication be-
tween the Union and Council. To
this end he has tried to encourage
observers at Council meetings,
the numbers of whom have aver-
aged about 15 at the three meet-
ings so far this session. He sees
Council as a rough equivalent of
Parliament, except that Parlia-
ment probably has more spectator
appeal. He thinks that FELIX is
the most important means of in-
forming Union members of what

happens at Council. He pointed
out that communication is a two-
way process and that many of the
representatives did not know
what the people they are sup-
posed to be representing think.
He does not think that the reps
should be mandated, as this de-
stroys the point of any discussion
on an issue. He sees the setting
up of the floor reps' " surgeries
as an admission of defeat by these
people that they have lost touch
with the rest of the Union. In
this case they are either bad floor
reps or the Union is bad for not
insisting that its views are repre-
sented.
Is there anything you would like
to see the Union do, which it
does not do now ?
He said that there were a lot
of things that the Union could do,
but did not think in most cases
that it should. Examples were
the setting up of a West London
accommodation bureau or a nur-
sery . These could come as ideas
from the Union but were better
put into practice by the College,
since the Union had neither the
time nor the expertise to do this
as well as the College could. He
cited student houses as an ex-
ample of this, where the Union
had interested the College in the
idea.
Do you think there is a case for
a sabbatical year for the Presi-
dent?
He said that he thought that
Presidents who had sabbatical
years were usually looking around
for something to " poke their
noses into." If the constituent
Colleges did not exist he thought
that a case could be made out
for a sabbatical year, but as it is
he does not have to liaise between
the students and the individual
departments, so the amount of
work he has to do does not justify
one. He made the point that
student politics " with a small 'p'
and in inverted commas " should
try to involve as many people as
possible in running the Union.
A sabbatical year would leave
many of the people at present
helping in Union affairs with little
to do. With a sabbatical year
there would probably be even
more complaints of autocracy by
the President.
When invited to make any fur-
further comments he said that he
thought at the moment that there
was a " gap of logic " on Council.
The Union General Meeting has
the final say in what goes on in
the Union and yet Council wants
to throw off representatives of the
Union e.g. constituent college
presidents and chairmen of clubs
committees from its sub-commit'
tees and replace them with rep
resentatives of Council.
He sees the current attempt to
give more power to Council as an
attempt by some people to gain
power for themselves. Some
Council members seem to be
there for their own egoism with
some Union officers trying to
make a name for themselves in
a year by pursuing one issue. He
ended by saying that Council is in
a confused state at the moment.

Wfiat does tlie average I.C. Union member want from I.C.
Union? Does lie (or she) contribute to the general inqucracy of ICU
meetings. Is he impressed with our Itallowed Executive and Council
or doesn't he know who they are'! The answer to these questions are
given by an unbiased (we hope) random sample of Union members
who responded to our snap survey.

In the answers to this question, the outstanding fact is that
nearly 60 per cent of our sample had not even sniffed at a Union
meeting this year. The reasons they gave ranged from being put off
by previous years' experience tofindingGeneral Studies more interest-
ing. Those who went generally were unimpressed and made accusa-
tions of time-wasting, petty squabbling and a great deal of debate
irrelevant to the average student. Several people commented that
constituent College Union meetings were much more lively and others
said that ECU. meetings had gone slowly downhill over the past few-
years.
Council Unimpressive
When asked which facets of the Union they considered important,
there were roughly equal votes for Clubs (118,) Welfare (99), and
Social facilities (95). A few other facets such as food, staff-student
relations and contacts with N.U.S. were mentioned. One true patriot
actually claimed to think FELIX important. The overlapping question
—"What do you want from the Union?"—seemed to be rather
difficult for people to answer. General feelings were that it should
provide a place to meet people and to give them something to do.
Others wanted representation on the Governing Body, accommoda-
tion, more intercollegiate spirit and approximately 1.38 per cent
wanted Home Rule for Wells Soc.
Would you know how to contact a member of Council?
To this question, 96 answered YES and 49 NO, so it seems that
Council members are reasonably well-known and approachable. How-
ever, included in the Noes are several who didn't even know what
Council is.
Are you impressed with the Executive and Council?
Yes Moderately No
