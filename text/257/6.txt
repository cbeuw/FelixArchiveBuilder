Just what is going to happen to our Union in the next few years ?
I think that one of the most important single items will be the
eventual fee increase fiom £4 per capita to £7. This increase was
approved by the Board of Governors, but has been held up by the
* TJGC At present we are overspending our grant by about £1,000
a year, and the Governors are paying tliis deficit for us until the fee
increase is allowed.

When we have the extra money, our first task will be to build
up our reserve fund. This we can do by investing up to £8,000 per
annum for the first few years. We shall need to make these giant
savings in preparation for the future, as we cannot expect another
increase for many years.
Some of the money wili have to go on refurnishing present
Union buildings, and also on developing the new Union premises in
College block, due to be opened in Summer 1969.
Even after these schemes, there should still be money left to
expand the activities of the Union's clubs and societies. It should be
possible to cater for more members, particularly in the new Sports
Centre, and tofinanceambitious projects which require large capital
investment. For example the Sailing club's proposal to buy a sea-
going yacht, which, whilst requiring an outlay of about £3,000, would
save money for the Union over the years. Perhaps we can finance
several projects like this when we have the capital available.
We will also need to examine
very carefully the system of giv-
ing subsidies to clubs and socie-
ties. At present, the subsidy is
roughly in proportion to tne cost
of tne activity. This means that
membership of one of the social
clubs, for example, usually carries
a very small subsidy, whilst mem-
bership of an athletic club can
carry a substantially larger one.
Should this status quo continue
to be accepted?
Much more could also be done
to provide general facilities, such
as newspapers and televisions, in
the Union buildings. These would
be used by all Union members,
whether active in clubs or not.
After all, everyone contributes an
equal amount to the Union's in-
come.
E C C ?
The structure of the Union will
also need to change over the next
few years. One very workable
suggestion is the setting up of an
Entertainments Clubs Committee
(ECC). This would be made up
of the chairman of the Entertain-
ments Committee, and the chair-
men of clubs such as Jazz
Club, Film Soc. and Dram. Soc.
It could then function along the
same lines as the present ACC,
RCC and SCC. This move is
necessary because these clubs, at
present part of RCC, have a very
specialized financial structure,
with large amounts of money
coming in and going out at times
of performances. They also dif-
fer from other clubs in that their
mejiibers tend to give entertain-
ment rather than receive it. A
previous experiment was to run
some of these clubs as part of the
present Entertainments Commit-
tee. This failed, basically because
the setup was not suitably de-
signed to exercise the careful fi-
nancial control needed.
N e w I d e a s
A considerable expansion of
other Union activities is also just
beginning. The Welfare and Ex-
ternal Affairs Committees are in
the process of being written into
the Union constitution. There are
sufficient new ideas being con-
sidered by these committees that
they should both cover an ex-
tremely wide range of interests in
the near future. For example, the
Welfare Committee might have to
divide into sections on Housing,
Health, and Finance, all the
size of the present committee.
In addition, a similar Union
committee on Halls of Residence
and Student Houses may be re-
quired soon, to cover the hoped
for expansion of the Student
Houses scheme. Another very
valuable setup is the Academic
Rep. system of the constituent
colleges. There is great scope at
present for students to help in the
improvement of undergraduate
courses. Perhaps the groups from
the three constituent colleges will
come together to further their
causes.
C h a n g e a t T o p
At the top of the Union, the
structure of the executive will
have to change. Officers of IC
Union, from its clubs and sub-
committees, will replace the con-
stituent college Presidents. This
is because the work of IC Union,
and of its executive, will certainly
expand in the next few years. The
constituent college Presidents,
who already concentrate largely
on their own unions, willfindcon-
stituent college activities taking
up all of their time. Therefore,
other officers of IC Union will be
required to share the increased
administrative load. In addition,
there will be a concentration on
matters common to all students
by IC Union, whilst the constitu-
ent colleges deal with their own
specialized interests, and foster
inter-college rivalry.
P r e s i d e n t i a l
D u t i e s
The President undertakes a
great deal of ICU administration
at the moment, including almost
all of the negotiations with the
college Administration. I think
it is this increasing work load that
has led to the President becoming
less and less of a public figure
throughout my time at IC. In
turn, this has played no mean
part in the fall of general interest
in the running of the Union, and
in the difficulties of getting a
quorate union meeting. To com-
bat this falling interest must be
one of the mo.;t immediate tasks
of the Union, and it is for this
UNION FINANCE
reason that I advocate a changed
executive, and a public ballot for
the office of President.
The question of a Sabbatical
Year for the President will surely
be raised soon, following the out-
break of Sabbatical Years in
other London colleges. This
would inevitably heighten the
present trend towards an admini-
strator-president, which could be
disastrous for the Union in its
present state. So I would suggest
that this is not a good idea for IC
at the present time.
N U S
Finally, the perennial debate—
should we join NUS? My per-
sonal view is that we should not.
This is because a strengthened
ICU will be capable of expressing
its own opinions, without the help
of NUS. We would almost cer-
tainly not agree with NUS on all
issues, and we can use our proud
tradition of independence to say
what we think.

The financial structure of the
Union is shown in the diagram.
The total Student Income is de-
rived mainly from fees and a sup-
plementary grant from the Go-
verning Body. With the income
from the Bookshop this totals
£20,000.
Of this the constituent colleges
get 18s. for each member (with
£500 bonus for R.S.M.) and this
accounts for £3,800. The major
drain on Union funds is A.C.C.
who absorb £5,200: this does not
include the costs of facilities such
as land and building, but only
equipment and other running
costs. R.C.C. receives a grant of
£2,800 and S.C.C. one of £800.
If clubs wish to spend any money
above their running costs they
have to apply to the Committee
to which they belong. Should the
required amount be too large for
it to dispense, they can refer it
to the Student Finance Commit-
tee which has £1,800 to allocate
as it chooses.
The bulk of the remainder
goes on running expenses and
prestige items like the President's
Dinner and Dance.

Theis's a slory about Ted Ncjdhatn at the time of a Union
meeting debating " Union sport is puerile." " I oppose this motion,"
he said, " because Union sport is no! paerile enough."
Perhaps for some that is true. But I don't believe that students
here are too irresponsible to be able to run their own affairs. And at
the moment they don't run their own business. It's done by a highly
indirectly elected and largely self-perpetuating hierarchy. The prob-
lem of ICU at present can be reduced to one thing : communications.
Remember Boston
" The home of the bean and the cod,
Where the Lowells talk to the Cabots
And the Cabots talk only to God."
Too many times, the serious talking is done within Council or
within the Executive : The Union is rarely consulted for its ideas.
Most people have their own ideas or grouses about the running of
(heir Union. Council and the executive should merely be a tool of
the student body, not the reigning dynasty.
well-known
Basic Problems
But this is all generalisation.
What is the basic problem? At
the moment IC clubs of all kinds
do well out of ICU. Just how well
they do, tends to depend on how
flourishing thev are. Most of the
rest of the Union money goes on
the constituent college unions and
on the union buildings. I question
the basic priorities of this spend-
ing. The priorities have been built
up over the years and it does not
seem that a fundamental review
of them has been carried out re-
cently. Anybody spending £20,000
a year should think out the policy
of its spending. And on the
distribution of the £20,000 de-
pends how effectively the different
parts of the Union function. At
the moment, as an example, Ents
are expected to make a profit and
subsidise the President's Dinner
and Dance: this
event is the opportunity for the
Union hierarchy to nosh together
for free. I think it might well be
better for Ents to run at a loss
with better name hops, drawing
more internal rather than external
students.
But who decides on these prio-
rities? Everybody, I know, faith-
fully reads the Union bye-laws
when they arrive here : the bye-
laws say 'tis council decides. And
who does council consult? Per-
haps their own consciences,
though some may doubt that.
Integrate
ICU must become a more inte-
grated whole, working together
rather than in rivalry. For this
reason, I believe that the constitu-
ent college unions are not at pre-
sent fulfilling their real function.
There is no real difference be-
tween Guildsmen, Minesmen, and
Mackmen. Other than in aca-
demic matters there need be no
distinction. The constituent col-
leges may claim to be nearer to
their members : I don't think
they use this to help IC as a
whole. I should like to see a
much stronger College-wide year
rep. system. Reps would start to
have the function as advisers to
both Council and the Executive.
They would get the opinions and
ideas of their years as well as tel-
ling their years about what goes
on in IC. So people would be
better informed, and Union mem-
bers would have a much more ob-
vious hand in what ICU does.
This power does exist now but in
such a remote sense—as one vote
at a Union meeting—that it is
widely regarded as non-existent,
It is not surprising that peope do
not care if they don't know what's
happening and if they don't feel
they can do anything about it.
External
Links
In addition, we must streng-
then our links with other student
bodies. We may not agree with
all that NUS says, but as long as
we stay out we cannot influence
the actions of the major national
student body. And because we
stay out IC's voice goes unheard.
What are our views on grant in-
creases? Who are we going to tell
and who will listen ? Inside NUS
we may influence its voice, which
is listened to.
Communication
Somebody said to me recently
that in ICU the bottom is apa-
thetic, the middle rotten and there
is nothing at the top. I was
tempted to agree. I believe that
we should make the lines of com-
munication through the IC stu-
dent body better, so that student
opinion may be better sounded
and decisions better explained.
But also come back to the fact
that those who are elected cannot
be better than their electors.
