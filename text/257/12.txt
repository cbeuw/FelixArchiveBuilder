Cup
Heart
Break
After the splendid 23-8 win
against Wye College in the second
replay of the quarter final, I.C.
were in a quietly confident mood
for the Semi-Final against Royal
Free Hospital.
It was a bleak, miserable day
and the game was played on a
sodden, muddy pitch. Only 10
mins. after the start with I.C.
well on top, Pine was forced to
take an early bath with a pulled
back muscle. With Dodson play-
ing a great game at scrum half,
Kelly soon scored a very good try
resulting from some slick handling
of the greasy ball. Swinnerton
converted.
Royal Free replied with a
penalty and so at half time, 5-3
to I.C. Soon after the interval,
Duke scored a superb solo try,
born of sheer guts and determina-
tion, and a myopic disregard for
the wall of Royal Free players
through which he ran. Unfortu-
nately the enemy replied with two
easy penalties and despite heroic
efforts in the last 10 mins. with
two trys disallowed, I.C. ended up
the most unlucky losers at 8-9.
Yet again the gods seem to
have deserted us in the cup but
we must now concenlnte on
building a good " sevens" team
for the U.L.U. tournament and
on enjoying the remaining
matches.

Eton
Fives
The Eton Fives Gub, which is
only in its second year of exist-
ence, is going from strength toj
strength. Last term two I.C. pairs
easily defeated Old Westminster
Citizens Eton Fives Club, their
first ever victory.
Last Fitday I.C. again played
Old Westminster Citizens, but
this time they put out some of
their best pairs. In the three
pairs match I.C. lost 2-1 but the
two games which were lost were
very close indeed, two deuce
games in the case of I.C.'s second
pair.
From match to match the stan-
dard of I.C. seems to get higher
and the influx of first years al-
ready having considerable talent
has been more than an asset. The
club's active members are not
really very many and anyone at
I.C. who played Eton Fives at
school to some degree of pro-
ficiency and is still interested in
playing should get in touch with
Paul Alexandre, Chem. Eng. 2.
The Plastic Fairytale may half died, but the spirit that brought it
to life lives on.

IS ENTS!
Ents have a new cor-'itntf-jn! So-md' ront\. looks pool, and
bv pollv, it's goinj to do rheni vioi, EH->'!em!stk*'ly labelled the
Entertainment Committee's pc'icv on Informal R'ltccs, it is " ths
first Ents constitution ever," according to chairman Keith Guy.
What does it do? It clarifies the way Ents arrange and run their
" informal dances " (or hops for the uneducated); it defines areas of
responsibility. This means that the chairman can castigate any member
of Ents who fails in his duty by simply quoting the relevant article
and sub-section. The constitution tightens up the way Ents handles
its takings. By simple devices such as numbered tickets it eliminates
as far as possible any dishonesty there might be among Ents. It
requires the chairman to attend Council meetings, to report to Ents
the fulminations of Council and vice-versa. It provides a sliding scale
by which to price hop tickets and a system of splitting hop profits
between Ents and the society sponsoring that hop. This provides for
the society, who run the hop on Saturday night, to take a maximum
£30 out, while Ents, responsible for booking, publicity and tickets,
scoop the rest. Below £60 the profits are shared equally. There is
also a clause forbidding members of Ents to pronounce publicly on
Ents matters not their own responsibility; this will enable the true
facts about Ents to be propagated, it is hoped.
Who wrote the constitution? better than it has for the past two

lead to gain an easy victory.
Soccer Club
After a temporary demoralisa-
tion after being knocked out of
the U.L. Cup, I.C. are back on
the winning trail and are slowly
climbing back up the league. Last
Wednesday I.C. beat Woolwich
Polytechnic 3—0 in a good match
at Harlington.
The pitch was rather heavy but
although the Woolwich team were
bigger man for man, I.C. seemed
to oe much more at home in the
mud. The first twenty minutes
saw some fast and good football
from both sides but no goals
came. Then I.C. got two quick
goals both taken very well by in-
side-left Mike Eastell and seemed
to control the game to half time.
In the second half Woolwich
seemed more determined and did
much of the attacking but failed
to score, Stuart Hewardine hav-
ing a good game in goal. With
ten minutes left Hopwood tried
a left-foot centre only to see the
ball crash into the corner of the
net—3-0 and a very competent
performance by I.C.
is shared between Keith Guy and
Dermott Corr, although each
claims to have done the major
portion of the spadework. Never-
theless it is an example of co-
operation between two leading
players in an example of what
has been the bane of this year's
Ents—the " personality clash."
Last term the secretary resigned,
for that cause; this term there was
serious talk of the chairman,
secretary and treasurer taking
the plunge together for this rea-
son. Guy has been accused of
various faults in his chairman-
ship of the committee; soon after
the beginning of this term Ents
went through a bad patch in
which they lost £70 on the Zoot
Money hop and the Plastic Fairy-
tale died unhappily. To stop both
poor chairmanship and poor
handling of hops two alternatives
appeared. One was that Guy plus
secretary Gordon Sage and treas-
urer Jacques Robinson resign, to-
gether. The other was that a con-
stitution be written. Just how
vociferously and wholeheartedly
the Ents cohorts clamoured
against the resignation of their
leader is a matter of opinion.
Nevertheless the constitution has
now been written and the bicker-
ing is (hopefully) over.
Running We 11
In fact, to judge from the op-
timistic Keith Guy, Explosion is
Ents! or to put it more prosa-
ically, "this year's Ents is running
I think they trust me—we are
all trying to improve the enter-
tainments at I.C." So far Ents
have £415 stashed away in the
kitty, most of this collected inside
the last month. A targetfigureof
£450 has been set by Council, but
Jacques Robinson reckons Ents.
could top £700. As regards
the standard of the groups
playing at E C , Guy rates it as
superior to most London colleges
and a great improvement on last
year. Acts that have played or are
to play here include the relatively
big-time names of Ben E. King,
Dantalion's Chariot, the Moody
Blues, the Marmalade, the Gera-
nium Pond and Elmer Gantry's
Velvet Opera; for May Ball,
Georgie Fame plus Brian Auger
and Julie Driscoll are projected.
The current policy is away from
" cattle-markets " and functional
publicity towards freaky posters
and more worthwhile music.
Fa i ry t a I e
What happened to the Eairy-
tale? " Trends arefickle,"said
Guy. It had a good atmosphere,
but competition with Friday night
Hall parties helped to kill it—
dead with a deficit of £8. Since
its death releases a good deal of
labout for other things, Ents
should, one hopes, go from
strength to strength during the
rest of the session, after their
previous setbacks. The crazy
world of Keith Guy lives!
