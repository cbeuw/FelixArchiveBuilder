DRUGS
NEAR RIOT AT
SMOKING CONCERT
"This is what always happens,"
said Malcolm "Spooks" Duckett,
Chairman of RCS Ents, forlornly,
of the damage caused by the
fracas which marked the end of
an otherwise excellent Smoking
Concert.
The concert started out by
pleasing everyone in the first few
seconds when Bob Mackman was
on the receiving end of a custard
pie, the first of a number to be
dished out mainly to Mackman
and Mike Tait, Vice-President of
RCS, who compered the show.
The first half consisted of eight
sketches, mostly, it seemed, by
Physics one, and including a take-
off of " Grandstand," and a lec-
ture on " Pharticle Physics," cul-
minating in a supremely obscene
spoof of a Chemistry lecture.
Besotted
Audience
After the interval the effects
of the free (and otherwise) beer
were much in evidence, drowning
almost all of Mike Tait's comper-
ing and making the audience miss
all but the most downright crudi-
ties from the stage (and from the
audience, come to that). At least
three sketches were ruined in this
way, mainly by three rows of un-
rulv people at the front.
A spontaneous Kangela in the
middle of the second half brought
an answering Boomalaka and
first beer and then the glasses
holding it were being thrown
around the front few rows of the
Hall. Prompt action by mem-
bers of RCS General Committee

Mr. Oleg Oresto (London cor-
respondent of Pravda) gave per-
sonal views on human rights in
the Soviet Union. He said that

lent, meant different things to

ing and the concert was allowed
to finish amid ever-mounting
" audience participation."
Retaliation
At the end of the last sketch
buckets of soegv brown paper
were thrown from the stafe at the
audience. What the organisers
had not expected was a barrage of
beer glasses and chairs being
thrown back. Before members ot
RCS General Committee could
stop it at least three chairs, in-
The next speaker was Mr.
Sidney Shipton (Secretary of the
World Jewish Organization (Bri-
tish Section)) who later com-
mented on some things Mr.
Orestor had said about Jews in
Russia. The phrase " the wan-
dering Jews " arose because Jews
had, in the past, been deprived of
many human rights. Mr. Ship-
numerable beer glasses, a micro-
phone and a mike stand had been
broken.
Theft
A final blow to RCS Ents, who
must be congratulated on produc-
ing what, for the most part, was
an extremely good show, was the
stealing of the whisky bottle
offered as a prize for the best
limerick.

ton said that the Universal De-
claration was completely in ac-
cord with ancient Jewish teaching
rather than more recent religions
which appeared to Mr. Shipton
to be insignificant. He went on to
show how many of the Ten Com-
mandments could be considered
as forerunners of the Declaration
of Human Rights.
A rabs
Mr. Iqbal, (Deputy High Com-
missioner for Pakistan) said that
the British had no right in the firs*
place to give Palestine away over
the heads of the Arabs. Mr.
Iqbal gave a long account of
Islam, which he considered to be
a successor to Judaism and
Christianity. The Koran, like the
Declaration of Human Rights,
proclaims the brotherhood ot man
and the unity of moral law.
On the subject of women, Mr.
Iqbal (who had previously refer-
red to the Chairman, Mrs. Joan
Ruddock, as Mr. Chairman) said,
among other things, that men
were naturally polygamous.
The UDHR, although repre-
senting possibly world con-
census, falls very short of the
concept Vis expressed in Islam,
which involves man in his spiri-
tual as weli as material existence.
In Islam, all people really are
equal before the law. He also
said that the UDHR, although
correctly concerned with demo-
cracy, was wrong to try and dic-
tate an electoral method.
The concept of the Welfare
State (which is intrinsic in Article
On one's way to report a lec-
ture about " The Use and Abuse
of Drugs " one might reasonably
anticipate fifty minutes of utter
boredom punctuated by spasms of
annoyance. That this did not
happen is to the credit of the
speakers at the week before last
Thursday's General Studies Lec-
ture, the Rev. Kenneth Leech and
Brenda Jordan are from a church
in the city, and Miss Jordan, Rev.
Leech's wife, is a psychologist.
They are both closely connected
with the problems of drugs and
dnitr addiction.
Miss Jordan sooke first, with
the aim of putting the use of

George Assimakis has announ-
ced the results of his Southside
Shop survey commissioned by
Martin Lack. Last term he dis-
tributed 500 questionnaires
throughout Southside; 202 resi-
dents replied, in the main expres-
sing dissatisfaction, even extreme
dissatisfaction with the shop. 35
per cent admitted to using it only
rarely, and with International
Stores 400 yards away it seems
surprising thefigureis not greater.
Dissatisfaction was positively
expressed with the variety of
goods available (80 per cent), the
price of these goods (75 per cent.)
and the hours opening (70 per
cent.). Ide*s for improving the

years ago, he said.
Doctr i ne
Prof. Manning (Emeritus Pro-
fessor of International Relations
at LSE) saidfirstthat he was not
there to propound Apartheid as
some people imagined but to talk
about Human Rights, although he
would have preferred to talk
about human happiness, in the
context of apartheid.
All over the world UDHR was
violated. In Britain, it was esti-
mated that 16 of the 30 articles
were infringed. In South Africa
Negroes have rights that they
have not fully enjoyed.
Rights, he said, are not had as
a matter of right but as a matter
of doctrine. There are four pos-
sible approaches to Human
Rights : Theological, Metaphysi-
cal, Sociological, and Ideological.
The Metaphysical approach was
ridiculous, the Sociological ap-
proach was undoubtedly best but
the Ideological approach was un-
fortunately most favoured at
present. The " rights vocabu-
lary " which accompanied the ide-
ological approach meant different
things to different peoples. Prof.
Manning said that all sociological
situations are different and to un-
derstand we must see the whole
situation, things did not simply
happen because of " rights,"
which he demonstrated with

bis, opiates, aud. others.
Rev. Leech then talked in more
detail about various drugs in
widespread misuse. Holding up a
boxful of assorted amphetamines,
he pointed out the once-famous
Purple Heart, and the popular
Black Bomber. He made several
interesting points about the use
of drugs. Generally, he said,
amphetamines are working class,
hash is middle class, and so on.
Like clothes, some drugs are sub-
ject to fashion; what London
smokes today, Manchester will
have in three month's time. In the
West Country, some people still
take Purple Hearts. Heroin ad-
diction seems to be related to a
particular mental make-up. The
use of heroin is increasing he said,
but discounted the theory that
cannabis users tend to "graduate"
to heroin. He also spoke at some
length about the sources of drugs
in this country, and the alarming
tendencies that are appearing.
variety included fresh fruit and
cheese to canned food and vege-
tables ; of the few items presently
in stock sugar was deemed the
most regular purchase.
A majority was in favour of
making the shop union-run, a
minority for leasing it out to a
private concern. There were a
large number of complaints about
the present management : " un-
co-operative," " never open on
time," " everything seems to be
on order but—", Assimakis adds
hopefully : " a young attractive
shop assistant was thought by
most people to be the ideal per-
son to handle the shop."
examples, saying that politics is
the art of the possible, not perfect,
and that the notion of natural
rights is vulnerable. The UDHR,
he said, was an unrealistic agree-
ment between SOME of the mem-
bers of the U.N., excluding South
Africa.
The problems of South Africa,
like all problems should be
examined specifically, he said,
and saw no reason whv South
Africa should bow to the " ideo-
logical imperialism" of other
countries. The white minnntv in
South Africa was alienated by the
"' rights vocabulary " and would
not change its ways until the rest
of the world approached them
more realistically.
trot. Manning's speech was in-
terrupiea a numoer of times and
was followed by bitter comments
on the real situation in South
Africa by a coloured South Af-
rican.
H y pocri sy
In all this we can see that every-
where there is a vast spectrum of
knowledge, application, and belief
in human rights. Most individu-
als and nations are either ignorant
of the UDHR or when they have
knowledge fail to fully live up to
their declared beliefs. It is only
after this hypocrisy has been de-
stroyed and knowledge of the
UDHR is more widespread that
we can hope to reap the rewards
which should follow.

HUMAN RIGHTS
TEACH-IN
Human rights are about people, individual freedoms, equality
of opportunity and equality before the law, the right of work, leisure,
social security, free thought and all other rights upheld by the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights.
In harmony with the purposes of Human Rights Year, the teach-
in on 1st February arranged by the IC HRY committee attempted to
bring home to everybody the breadth of the concept of human rights
and compare the interpretation of them bv various communities.
The five distinguished speakers talked for 4\ hours to a packed
audience (90 people were still present at 10.30 p.m.).
different countries and that, like
U.N
The first speaker, Mr. James
Fawcett (one-time member of the
drafting committee for the
U.D.H.R. and member of the
European Commission on Human
Rights) explained what human
rights were and said that the ob-
ject of the declaration was to set
a common standard to be
achieved by all nations. At-
tempts by way of International
covenants are now being made to
make the declaration into an en-
forceable document so that what
is at present a list of " claims "
may become legal rights. The
General Assembly, as part of the
general plan to increase the
power of the UN Commission oh
Human Rights, is considering a
proposal to appoint a UN High
Commissioner on Human Rights.
free speech, by itself it was in-
effective if not accompanied by
the ability to act. As a commu-
nist he stated that the concept of
absolute freedom was a myth and
that man has no existence outside
society, therefore his rights de-
pend on society. He explained
that only a socialist state can
guarantee work and security for
all. The rights of women and
minority groups were very well
cared for.
While admitting that there may
be some things wrong with the
Soviet Union he said that their
Press was more democratic than
ours which was controlled by a
