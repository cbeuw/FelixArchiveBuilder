I C W o r d s
February 14th—the feastday
of that well-versed, anonymous
cad, or should I say card (not that
I'm complaining; I had my fair
share—one.)
Anyway, imagine the scene in
a dark, intimate, secluded corner
of the Union, the Reading Room;
the walls are festooned with two
large red hearts; the time is 8
o'clock; music positively leaps
through the loud speakers to re-
verberate from the opposite wall.
The room gradually fills and by
9.30 p.m. a whole barrel of beer
has been consumed. It is promised
that a second barrel will be tap-
ped after the Mr. ICWA election
which takes place at 10.15. Six
candidates stood for this post, de-
spite some peorjle, including I'm
told the Secretary, thinking that
only four names were inscribed
on the nomination sheet. Among
these was an uncertain under-
writer to His Most Gracious
Macxman. Next year, as overlord
of the most powerful female orga-
nisation since the Women's in-
stitute, he will be wearing rings
on both hands. The Rugby Club
have by this time arrived and the
second barrel of beer drains in 30
minutes. More of the Rugby
Club arrive—You mean there was
a third barrel???
By 11.30 p.m. the room is empty-
ing fast to the rhythmic tinkling
of breaking glass and people fal-
ling downstairs—the end to this
year's unofficial ICWA hop And
at midnight, if you were still up
and you purport to live in Beit,
you too could have seen the
ICWA Executive playing hop-
scotch across the Quadrangle.
(Would anyone who saw the inci-
dent or can give further infor-
mation, please contact WHI 1212)
MACKiVSANIA
Many people ask what does the
President of RCS do all day? At
last Mackmania brings you the
true facts :
At n o'clock (n is large and
positive), R.E.M. wakes up, leaps
(?) out of bed. No breakfast-
too busy. Collects notes and
checks 1 izard rack. Runs across
Exhibition Road stopping only to
crawl under a Mark 111 Ford.
Checks Union Office and arrives
at lecture only five minutes late
. . . races out of lecture to book
Level 8 for R.C.S.A. function.
Have you joined yet? See Miss
Paget, R.C.S. Office, Int. 3869.
Trundles off to Union Office to
have a chat with Auntie Jane and
Uncle Ray . . . eats lunch with
Registrar and Auntie Jane and
discusses next year's Freshers'
Day. A moment to spare! R.E.M.
retires to his favourite hideaway
—through the back entrance of
the Harrington into Petersham
Lane to the new Fangio Motor
Museum — for a quick flip
through press cuttings and exhi-
bits. Duty calls! Return to
Union for Carnival Board meet-
ing. Fete or no Fete—R.E.M.
deliberates. Checks R.C.S. office.
Proceeds to Physics building for
another lecture, thinks : " How
many tee-shirts has Pete Dolwin
sold?" . . . Toddles off to book
lecture theatre for next RCS meet-
ing, gazing with pride upon his
Sunbeam Talbot Mk II (with
buckled wheel) on the way.
Leaves Chemistry and gazes up
on Queen's Tower, symbol of
I.C.'s masculinity. Walks past
bicycle sheds. Has Pat Haxell
had any more information about
bicycle security? Whose rusty
old Jensen is that!! ? Returns to

O F M I N E S
This week is the long promised
" collecting week " when Mines
are hoping to reach their target of
£i,000. (Metallurgists; note; for
tomorrow night). Mines have
already collected £600 which
works out at £2/undergraduate
head, far in front of either of the
other two colleges, but let's get
this £1000 and show, once again,
wliicli is the best college in IC.
On the 28th Feb. " Ye Royal
School of Mines Union is having
an outing to Queens Ice Skating
Rink, Bayswater—via the Union,
the Queens, the Denmark, the
Zetland, the Gloucester, the Hoop
and Toy, etc. There will be
a festival of skill and agility by
the champions of each depart-
ment and the one who is chosen
as the best will be able to buy the
Vice-President a pint.
Sorry for this short article but
when one spends hours writing a
decent article and it is not printed
—hint, hint!
G U I L D S P O T
1 was overcome with joy to see
that the world famous impres-
sario on spoons, Jay Ukelelce
Murendel, is appearing at Guilds-
Mines Carnival. It is now over
thirty years since this musical
genius has performed in this
country and it will be of great in-
terest to listen to the man who
has had such an immense influ-
ence on the latest work of Knasal
Phrome. A large contingent of
fans is reported to be hitching
down from John O'Groats as well
(or at least as well as can be ex-
pected) for this event so get your
ticket now.
News Flash : . . . Roy Lichten-
stein suing Guilds Ents Pub-
licity.
The Dinner and Dance was a
huge success and with the soccer
team beating Mines 5-4 to win the
Tech cup we are enjoying the
usual unusual amount of suc-
cess.
News Flash : . . . Royal Family
seeking High Court injunction
to restrain Guilds Ents Pub-
licity.
The annual hunt the barge pole
in I.C.'s own green belt, Hyde
Park, takes place at the next
Union meeting in the form of the
Field Cup. Second and third
year students will be familiar with
the rules (or lack thereof) in
this venture and it is clearly not
in their best interests to explain
them to the first year students.
News Flash : . . . The attempt
by Guilds Ents Publicity to
syphon the Serpentine down
Exhibition Road failed miser-
ably, more suckers required.
Two months aco a question-
naire was distributed among
puil'lsmen in an attempt to in-
vestigate the current trend in
student aoathy. As yet no forms
have b~cn returned.
News Flash : . . . Police have
imnnnndH Guilds Pot.
Southside to dump notes. Is
R.E.M. going to propose Roger
Webb for Mr. ICWA? Gets a
few more replies to invitation for
R.C.S. dinner. Why don't staff
reply quicker ? Hunger calls !
Pops through hole in the wall to
the " Hen's Egg" just off the
Brompton Road . . . back to

The Menace of
Bureaucracy
A couple of years ago, at a
secret meeting in a darkened hall
room, a member of Council (who
shall, of course, be nameless)
allowed me my very first privi-
leged glimpse of some Council
minutes. He said—and he was
wrong—-that they were confiden-
tial but that he trusted me not to
share my knowledge of the Stu-
dent Finance Committee report
with unauthorised persons—and
I loyally kept silent until I dis-
covered to my horror that these
vital documents were generally
available in the Union Office
and would be shown to whomso-
ever Robb might desire.
The attitude of the nameless
one was, however, more typical
of this Union than most would
care to admit and to many of us
the marvellous mysteries of
Union bureaucracy remain
shrouded for ever in an impene-
trable fog of minutes, reports,
initials and matters arising. The
source of most decisions is
dubious ; and even the conscien-
tous student of those Epistles to
the Plebs, the Union Blue book
(constitutions and advertisements
for clubs) and the Union Red
Book (pictures of the President
and advertisements for pubs) will
remain ignorant of, for example,
who appoints the editor of
" Felix " or what basis Council
uses when distributing your
twenty-thousand quid.
A seiies in which articles are
invited nn subjects dear to the
writers' heart*.
That Council sometimes seems
equally ignorant is, of course, a
result of this same, possibly un-
deliberate, secretiveness. Its
members, launched rapidly from
the obscurity of anonymous
readers of "Felix" to their pre-
cious seats round the Big Table
Where It All Happens, are
elected to joint staff-student com-
mittees (ever heard of them ?) at
their first Council meeting and
expected to approve the financial
estimates for the year at their
second. Finding that the impor-
tant decisions have now been
taken — by somebody — they are
silent at their third meeting and
try and think of something to
say at their fourth. By their
fifth meeting they feel almost at
the end of their term of office(the
average Council member only at-
tends about 6.3 meetings during
his meteoric career) and start
wondering vaguely who is going
to be President next year. . .
Having cast their vote for the
apparent best of a bad lot at
Joint Council, and having now
some idea of how it all works,
they retire to write imaginative
applications for jobs (not for-
getting to mention their great ex-
perience of administration and
handling people in Union work)
and buy their Council ties (four
inches wide at the bottom,
maroon with green sphinxes and
yellow stripes, at 2/6 from the
Bookstall, a snob's nightmare
ideal for the English climate).
Somehow the things they
wanted to do have been left un-
done, the things they wanted to
say unsaid. The few ideas that
they have produced have been
swallowed in vague promises and
forgotten minutes, and are lost
and will have to be rediscovered
and rediscovered again before
they will bear any fruit.
Who now remembers why we
have a Halls of Residence Repre-
sentative, or what he is supposed
to represent to whom ? Who now
remembers the purpose or even
the existence of Refectory Com-
plaints Officers, the fruit of some
ancient conflict with the re-
doubtable and indestructible
Mooney ? Who was the original
Publicity Officer whose " Ap-
proved " stamp is now wielded
with great skill by the Union re-
ceptionist, and to whom is our
Publicity Officer responsible for
what ? What was the Welfare
Officer supposed to do when he
was not expected to report to
Council about Welfare, a touch-
ing custom reluctantly revived
this year ? What was the Ex-
ternal Affairs Committee on
which Council was represented
for some years before it dis-
covered that there was no such
body and it had better be re-
established ?
Somebody sometimes has the
sheer nerve to ask these ques-
tions, to interrupt the smooth,
comfortable flow of finance, re-
ports and no other business ; but
for too many years too many
people at too many levels in the
Union have sunk quietly into an
uncomprehending lethargy, aris-
ing only to groan when the few
who are still awake try and put
across a point of principle or a
new idea.
Bureaucracy is vital to the
running of any organisation, but
it must be the means and not the
end. For too long " efficiency "
has been the criterion for promo-
tion in the Union hierarchy, and
men with initiative have found
that the great, untidy bureacracy
of this Union has been the last
refuge of thoughtless routine and
routine thoughtlessness. Unless
I.C. Union is careful it will wake
up soon to find itself strangled
by its much-minuted children,
and after that no further matters
will be arising. . . .
