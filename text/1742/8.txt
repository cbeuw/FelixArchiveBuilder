COMMENT
Abhijay Sood
Union President
I
f you’ve been read-
ing Felix over the
last few weeks you
might have seen
that the Union has been
conducting negotiations
with the College over the
price of rent in first-year
halls of residence. These
have come to an end, and
the headline result is that
we could not come to an
agreement. However, by
continually engaging in
thenegotiationsandtaking
a firm view that we should
not endorse unaffordable
prices for students, we
have been able to secure
a £3 million reduction
on the rent prices over a
5-year period. Here’s how
we’ve got to where we are
now.
Background
Negotiations began late
last year when the College
provided us with an
updated financial model
for hall rents, to coincide
with the opening of a new
hall (Kemp Porter) in the
coming academic year
which will roughly double
the number of available
bed spaces in Acton.
The model included
some costs our rents
already cover, such as
day-to-day and long-term
maintenance, security
and other staff costs, and
capital costs: the costs
associated with paying
down the debt the College
incursinbuildingthehalls.
It also included additional
costs: certain staff whose
salaries were not previ-
ously covered by student
rents were added, raising
the total figure. This led to
questions, as did the logic
behind the steep (80%)
increase in long-term
maintenance costs, the
implicit assertion that the
halls would totally lose
their value after a 50-year
design life (with students
picking up the tab for this
depreciation) despite this
maintenance, and the way
costs were being inflated.
More fundamentally, the
logic behind a “break-
even” model, where
student rents were made
to cover any and all costs
the College associate with
these halls, was question-
able. None of the revenue
from the planned lease of
Pembridge Hall would be
factored into supporting
these rents, for example.
The Negotiations
The ensuing back and
forth led to some minor
concessions. Proposals
we were offered were
rejected in deliberation
with elected student reps
at Union Council, on the
grounds that they still
presented steep increases
without a satisfactory
explanation.
Most recently, earlier
this week, we had some
promising conversations
towards a workable com-
promise. Unfortunately,
the College’s resultant
“final offer” (£3m out of a
total ~£110m over 5 years)
wasn’t enough for us to
be willing to endorse it.
Though it makes a small
difference, this offer will
still lead to steep increases
in rent, beyond the realms
of what’s reasonable (in
the short term), and we
don’t feel the College has
truly engaged with us on
the fundamental premises
that led to these costs. We
are now exploring other
options to effect change
on this matter.
From our experience,
we wanted to share our
key takeaways:
1) Saying “no”
works
Though the place we’ve
ended up is far from ideal,
it does represent a con-
cession on the part of the
College that didn’t come
by default. The College
were expecting us to focus
on how to spread the rent
increases across different
halls, as our predecessors
did, rather than on the
increases themselves. By
saying “no”, and having
a more holistic conversa-
tion, we were able to shine
a spotlight on this issue
and shift the College’s
position.
2) Access to infor-
mation matters
While some of the
information we asked for
was shared with us, lots
of what we were given
fell short of the detail
we would have expected
either because the College
was unwilling to provide
the information, or the
information didn’t exist.
We can’t be expected to
make informed decisions
with such asymmetry.
3) The College’s
finances are prioritised
over students’ finances
While the College says
what is being offered is
affordable compared to
other London university
halls, there are some
issues with this: 1) it’s not
necessarily clear if that
will still be the case in 5
years’ time, 2) many of
these universities rely on
private accommodation,
whereas we are negoti-
ating over an in-house
provision, 3) rent in our
halls would be increasing
far in excess of rents in
private accommodation,
4) by the College’s own
calculations, after any
kind of increase on this
year’s rents, it would be
cheaper for the average
funding should go into
supporting them should
not be taken for granted,
yet staff members on key
College committees were
(to our knowledge) never
presented with a proposal
for such a subsidy.
4) The university is
working against itself
Simply put, too many
decisions at Imperial are
taken in exclusion of each
other. While the Provost’s
new academic strategy
speaks about considering
the experience of students
holistically (i.e. acknowl-
edging the blurred lines
between our academic and
non-academic experience
of Imperial), the College’s
proposals on rent remain
antithetical to any work
staff and students do
to improve our student
satisfaction, or supporting
underrepresented students
in line with regulatory re-
quirements. We shouldn’t
be in a situation where the
efforts and spending of
one team in the College
directly counteract that of
another.
5) Working together
matters
We ran for these roles
on a simple principle:
that those affected by
decisions Imperial makes
(students and staff)
should be involved in the
decision-making process.
This doesn’t mean being
consulted only to be put
to one side: we need to
work in partnership from
the beginning on major
issues like this. Were there
faith that all parties want
what’s best for Imperial
as a whole, there would
be higher levels of trust
across our campuses,
and less ill-feeling when
difficult decisions have to
be made.

student to live outside
halls than in them. This
is difficult to understand:
landlords make a profit,
while the College ought to
be “breaking even”.
First year halls of res-
idence are very important
to the undergraduate expe-
rience; to (in the College’s
words) “develop a sense
of home and community.”
