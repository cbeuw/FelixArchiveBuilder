A
rt Club
launched a
new exhibition
this week, cel-
ebrating the work created
by their members titled
“Moment to Reflect.”
The exhibition is located
on floor five of Sherfield
in the Blyth Gallery and
closes on the 21st of
February. The exhibition
is free to enter.
The exhibition opened
on Tuesday, 4th February
with copious amounts of
wine and cheese provided
by Art Club as the artists
and interested parties clus-
tered around the pieces to
enjoy the artwork. The
art is focused around
the theme, “Moment
to Reflect.” The work
certainly features many
mirrors and other lustrous
surfaces, a creative tent
and, for those that attend
early, free soap with
suspended inspirational
quotes.
Recently renamed
from Leo Soc, Art Club
has flourished in the last
year, attracting many new
members. As a creative
space at a mostly techni-
cal university, Art Club
provides a different envi-
ronment than most areas
around campus. Keqi, the
current President of Art
Club has always enjoyed
art, but unfortunately ne-
glected her artistic urges
until she joined Art Club.
Her favourite part of the
exhibition and possibly
the comfiest exhibit there
were two beanbags that
were worked on collabo-
ratively by all members
of the society. Liva, an
art scholarship student’s
favourite piece is entitled
“before you go,” towards
the end of the exhibi-
tion. Aidan, one of the
exhibition coordinators,
prefers the chamber of
reflection. Felix recom-
mends checking it out for
yourself.

IDE and GID Students Exhibit in Main Entrance
T
his Wednesday,
the Main
Entrance saw
I m p e r i a l ' s
Innovation Design
Engineering (IDE) and
Global Innovation Design
(GID) students presenting
the result of their most
recent projects. In this
day-long exhibition, stu-
dents gathered to inform
interested observers about
their various designs.
Between compacting
ground coffee beans to
make reusable plant pots
and using human society
to preserve the genetic
diversity of endangered
moss and lichens, the
different projects spanned
a variety of diverse fields.

their area of interest in a
joint venture between the
Royal College of Art and
Imperial College London.
Felix spoke to Yishan
Qin, an IDE student of
a team that started the
'HABITATE' project at
one of the 14 stalls, who
said that this project aims
to preserve endangered
pH-sensitive moss and
lichen species that grow
on the bark of ash trees by
creating artificial replicas
of ash bark with 4 main
features. These silicone
replicas are created using
3D scanning of the micro-
texture of bark, allowing
moss and lichen to grow
in the crevices of bark as
they are accustomed to.
These replicas have been
made porous enough to
ensure that the moss and
fungi receive sufficient
moisture. To replicate
the exact conditions that
make them so rare, the
replica has a more acidic
pH of approximately 6.8.
To maximize the light that
the lichens receive for
photosynthesis, light rays
are concentrated by spe-
cially engineered lenses
that have been partially
affixed onto different
sections of the replicated
bark, ensuring a continu-
ous supply of air.
Woodland Trust's
website states that 95% of
ash trees are projected to
die as a result of a foreign
disease called "ash
dieback". The remaining
5% are expected to be re-
sistant to this disease, but
the population of ash trees
is not expected to return to
current levels for another
50 years. In the meantime,
small animals that live
in ash tree habitats will
relocate or die out, with
the side effect that moss
and lichen unique to the
ash tree habitat are not
likely to be able to spread
their spores effectively.
This would accelerate
their imminent extinction.
Hence, the group is now
looking to remodel the
silicone replicas into
wearable habitats. Yishan
explained further, stating
that human society is very
active, making humans a
very encouraging substi-
tute while ash tree popula-
tions are replenished.
Other projects covered
topics such as using
seawater rather than fresh
water to create durable
fabrics, thus using a
less finite resource and
reducing the usage of
fresh water which could
instead be used for other
purposes, 'clingy' robots
which seek out humans
to nuzzle up to and could
be kept like pets to reduce
loneliness or address
mental health concerns,
and a device to reduce mi-
croplastic pollution from
tyre wear.
