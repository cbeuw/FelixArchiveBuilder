these rapidly increasing
prices would cause to the
student experience. But
that isn’t really in conten-
tion.
On Tuesday, Union
Council met to continue
this ongoing discussion,
after a majority of
Council members noted
their discomfort at the
Council Meeting on 21st
January. At the behest
of Council, an ‘Extraor-
dinary Meeting’ was
arranged for two weeks
later, to discuss our next
steps. This ‘Extraordinary
Meeting’ featured the
third and (allegedly) ﬁnal
offer from College, which
Council voted to reject
as well. This third model
featured a £3m subsidy
that could be distributed
how the Union desired,
should we have voted to
accept the deal. It was pre-
sented to Council for the
ﬁrst time at the meeting,
with minimal detail into
how the subsidy would
be distributed across the
various halls of residenc-
es. However, this lack
of detail or clarity made
us feel that we could not
vote either way on this
proposal, regardless of
our personal opinions on
the subject.
As voting members
of Council, we chose to
abstain from this vote due
to a lack of clarity around
the third proposed model,
lack of time to deliberate
on the issue, and a general
discomfort with the
proceedings. We’re very
aware that the ﬁgures
were given to the Union
President about four
hours before the meeting
and there is slight time
pressure since College
need to start advertising
the price of halls soon.
However, we should not
have been expected to
vote on an issue that we
did not have enough time
to process individually or
consult our committees
and members about.
Absent Council members
were also deprived of the
opportunity to speak up
about the new proposal,
or to even see it, before it
was rejected. The blame
for this lack of clarity lies
squarely with College –
providing a “new” model
mere hours before student
representatives are asked
to vote on it is shameful
and blatantly disrespect-
ful.
After that third rejec-
tion, the vote turned to a
much more contentious
topic – what to do next.
Council had rejected the
College’s ﬁnancial model
three times, and a plan of
what to do next was delib-
erated at this Extraordi-
nary Meeting. Of course,
the Union President and
the Deputy President
(Welfare) will go back to
College and re-negotiate.
We believe that College
have so far been somewhat
willing to negotiate, albeit
with a frustrating lack of
transparency, and still
have some leeway, but
beyond that no concrete
plan had been mentioned.
And this is where things
got strange.
On Wednesday 29th
January, the Union held
a preliminary, two-hour-
long meeting where any
interested members of
Council could come along
and have their say on
possible options. We were
not able to attend this
meeting due to prior com-
mitments, but a document
was written following this
meeting.
This document com-
prises two main sections:
ﬁrst, a recommendation
from Council that a
Union campaign called
“Imperial, Cut the Rent”
be started, which “any
student would be able to
join” and would “be run by
a committee elected from
its members”. The second
part of the document was
a list of possible options
of campaign strategies,
which we as a Council
debated individually
as discrete strategies
to endorse. There are
numerous things that we
thought were weird about
this.
First of all, this
document was presented
to members of Council
before we had voted to
reject the third model.
We appreciate that the
document had been
writtenbeforethemeeting,
but isn’t it inappropriate
to state the intention of
Council to proceed with
a campaign against the
model before we’d voted
to against it? Regardless,
voting on options that we
are presented with at the
start of a session is ludi-
crous; there is no time to
form a full opinion, which
limits the effectiveness of
any debate.
Secondly, after asking
for clariﬁcation about
this possible campaign, it
became clear that despite
Council recommending
this campaign, there
would be no explicit over-
sight by Council over the
actions of this campaign.
The campaign would be
encouraged to report to
Council, but it would not
be directly responsible to
Council. Why?
If Council is rec-
ommending that a
campaign is started, that
is essentially a stamp of
approval of the campaign,
writ large, regardless of
whether or not we as a
Council actually endorse
it. Regardless of whether
or not that is true, that is
how it looks, and that is
how a campaign could
argue: “You don’t like our
actions? Why not? You
endorsed us.” It’s odd that
Council would want to
vote to create a campaign
over which it would
have no oversight and in
which members may not
be involved. If a student
had started a campaign
independently, we should
deﬁnitely support them,
and they should be free
to campaign in whichever
way they see ﬁt. But
creating a campaign over
which we would have no
oversight, but to which
we would put our name,
is odd.
Clearly, the Union
wishes to retain control
over some aspect of the
campaign, or we wouldn’t
have gone through a list of
campaign strategies and
chosen which individual
options to endorse.
We should have chosen
a more deﬁnitive path.
The campaign should
either be led and fully
endorsed by the Union,
or fully student-led. The
idea here was to get a
“best of both worlds”
scenario - a campaign that
is student-led but with a
limited range of actions
endorsed by Council.
While a campaign would
technically be able to
proceed how they wanted
to, the implication of
control from Council
is clear. A student-led
campaign should be able
to use their voice in any
way they see ﬁt, and
not be controlled by an
external body of students
who are not necessarily
heavily involved in the
campaign. But should this
campaign lead to an irrec-
oncilable breakdown in
negotiations with College,
there is very little room
for Council to denounce
R
ent prices in
halls is a tricky
topic. Almost
every elected
representative on Union
Council, Imperial College
Union’s highest elected
deliberative body, agrees
that the proposals that the
College have delivered to
the Union Leadership are
unacceptable. The original
proposal would have seen
rent in halls rise either by
12.2% between 2019/20
to 2020/21 followed by a
yearly 2.5% “inﬂationary”
increase until 2024/25,
while the second proposal
would have resulted in a
yearly average of 5.5%
from 3 three years until
2022/23, followed by the
inﬂationary increase of
2.5% until 2024/25. The
implications here are dire,
reaching >£300 pw for
halls in South Kensington
by 2024. The ﬁnancial
model that College has
proposed is allegedly
a “break-even” model,
with assumptions such
as valuing the building
as worth nothing after 50
years, not including proﬁt
from Pembridge, which
is being retired, and ap-
plying inﬂationary uplift
to the part of the revenue
used to pay off the loan
and interest used to build
the new Kemp Porter halls
(which does not increase
with inﬂation). To us on
Council, that model is un-
acceptable and certainly
not “break-even”.
But opposition to this
is clear. Council has now
rejected this model 3
times, as the fundamental
basis of this model is
ﬂawed and the effects of
implementing it would be
disastrous no matter how
you tweak the numbers –
minor concessions cannot
offset the damage that
We’d Like to Make Our Discomfort Ofﬁcial
“Providing a
new model
mere hours
before student
representativ-
es are asked
to vote on it
is shameful
and blatantly
disrespectful”
its actions, given that
we recommended its
creation.
Concerns were raised
about Council oversight
limiting the impact and
responsiveness of the
campaign – and we
agree. But endorsing the
creation of the campaign
without having any
explicit control over
its actions leads to an
uncomfortable grey area
where we can’t really
raise any concerns with
the campaign if things go
south. We are now linked
to the actions of any
campaign that starts, re-
gardless of whether or not
they choose to adhere to
the strategies that Council
chose to endorse.
This is not to say that
we think a campaign will
go south. We fully support
the right of students to use
their voice how they see
ﬁt, and to ﬁght to make
Imperial a better place.
But Council should not
interfere in that voice. We
should either support our
students with their en-
deavours or take a stand
ourselves, but the votes
on Tuesday 4th February
created a neither-nor
scenario where Council
voted to hand this matter
over to an independent
group of students. This
in-between stance looks
weak and jeopardises the
power of the campaign,
by both attempting to in-
ﬂuence the actions of any
campaign that starts, but
not being ofﬁcially spear-
headed by the Union.
Options should have been
presented in advance of
the meeting to give us
more time to consider
them before voting on
these matters.
