The Vegan Butcher
A

2020 draws
to a close,
t h o u s a n d s
of people will have
resolved to spend the
month without eating or
using any animal prod-
ucts. The Veganuary
charity, based in the
UK, anticipates 350,000
people completing the
challenge worldwide.
But why would so many
people want to do this?
Before getting into the
reasons, let me tell you
a little about my own
story.
For eight years I
worked at my uncle’s
butcher’s shop in my
hometown, in North
West England. I started
working part-time in my
early teens, continuing
throughout my second-
ary school and sixth
form years. I fondly
recall my colleagues,
the work banter and
delicious pork pies, and
I feel that working there

was a big contributor
toward my development
of a good work ethic.
I had been concerned
about climate change
for some years, but
somehow this wasn’t
at the forefront of my
attention. I don’t envy
teenagers today, who
hear about catastrophic
fires and global protests
every single day. I, on
the other hand, didn’t
hear too much about
climate change and
could safely deny (in the
passive, personal sense)
that it was happening, as
many people continue to
do today (sometimes in
a less passive manner).
I started an under-
graduate degree in Man-
chester, close enough
to my hometown that I
could go back to work
the odd Saturday shift
at my uncle’s shop. I
became involved in
environmental activism.
As I learned about the
climate crisis, I became
employed every one of
my family members.
We are all very proud of
what he has achieved.
But at some point the
hypocrisy of promoting
climate activism and
working in the meat
industry became too
much for me. The day
that I finally declared
I was going vegetarian
- and for what reasons
- there was a lot of
confusion. Whilst it is
perfectly understanda-
ble that my uncle would
be defensive about my
reasons, I am of the
belief that everyone is
entitled to their own
lifestyle choices and that
this should be respected.
I do not criticise others
for eating meat, so I
don’t expect to be crit-
icised for making the
opposite choice. I am
happy to say that my
uncle and I are able to
talk quite openly about
these topics. Once he
even recommended a
restaurant to me for its
vegetarian options!
There is no one reason
that people choose to
be vegan; reducing
animal suffering, health
benefits and conscious-
ness about the contribu-
tion to climate change
are driving forces in
differing proportions.
Whilst I focus mainly on
the latter aspect in this
column, there is a lot to
be said regarding how
veganism can help both
human and non-human
animals alike.
The vast majority of
the energy available
to us on Planet Earth
comes - directly or indi-
rectly - from the sun. A
proportion of this energy
is taken on by plants as
they photosynthesize,
converting the solar
energy into chemical
energy. Herbivorous
and omnivorous animals
are able to tap into
this chemical energy
by eating plant matter,
although the process
is not perfect - plenty
of the energy is wasted
during the consumption
process. The same can
be said for when carniv-
orous and omnivorous
animals consume other
animals lower down the
food chain. Ultimately,
we observe that the
total energy required
to provide a carnivore
with one calorie is gen-
erally greater than that
required to provide one
calorie to a herbivore.
The great advantage
of human omnivory is
that we get to choose!
By choosing a more
herbivorous diet, we
are able to reduce
the amount of energy
required to grow our
food. That means fewer
links in the food chain,
smaller transportation
networks and increased
scope for ultra-efficient
growing methods, such
as vertical farming. Each
of these aspects comes
with a reduced carbon
footprint, compared with
conventional livestock
farming. In addition,
research suggests that
cows emit a considera-
ble amount of methane -
a greenhouse gas which

catastrophic
fires and

“By choosing
a more
herbivorous
diet, we are
able to reduce
the amount
of energy
required to
grow our food”
more and more aware
of the environmental
impact of the meat
industry, at which point
I started to question the
consistency between my
views and my part-time
job.
My uncle’s shop is
very much a family
business, which has
