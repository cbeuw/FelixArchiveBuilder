Wargroove - How Does the Game Hold up One Year

W
a r g r o o v e
is one of
the most
c h a r m i n g
games I have played in the
last year. On the surface it
is just a turn-based tactics
game with a cute art style,
but as you dive deep into
the lore, gameplay and
competitive multiplayer,
you soon realise that this
is a title more than fitting
as the spiritual successor
to Advance Wars.
Wargrooveisdeveloped
and published by Chuck-
lefish – a British video
game developer based in
London! They are known
for some amazing Indie
Games, such as Starbound
and Stardew Valley, the
latter being a masterpiece
in itself.
With a team of only 13
permanent staff, it’s truly
amazing what they can
accomplish.
As someone who is
typically not a fan of turn-
based tactics games, I was
initially sceptical. I heard
great things and decided
to buy the physical copy
on Nintendo Switch; it
had a map and a strategy
guide, so I guess I had
to, I am a huge collector
after all. I booted it up and
was immediately greeted
by a dramatic opening
cutscene, hand-drawn yet
not lacking beautifully
animated movement.
From the moment I saw
this, I knew the game
had charm. There are
three modes that you can
play. The story mode is
single player only and
takes you on a journey
through the continent of
Aurania to defeat the evil
forces of Felheim after
Sigrid – a 900-year-old
vampire – murders the
main character’s father
in cold blood. I say the
main character rather than
just ‘you’ as you play as
much more than just the
princess Mercia. As you
progress through the story
you learn about 4 main
warring factions through-
out Aurania and have
access to play as many
of the leaders of these
factions. The brilliant
thing about Wargroove is
“What makes
Wargroove
really stand
out is its
artistic value”
“Multiplayer
is always fun.
You never feel
as though you
have been
cheesed from a
sure victory”
that each faction leader
has their own special
ability or ‘Groove’ which
dictates the play style of
whomever you are given
at the start of the battle.
This groove can range
from healing people in
an area to summoning an
undead skeleton to aid
you in battle.
The gameplay is very
addictive. Summoning
units and capturing
villages with said units in
order to gain income is the
main focus of each battle
– as well as either destroy-
ing the enemy stronghold
or leader to eventually
win. This seems simple
enough, but with each unit
having their own strengths
and weaknesses (rock-pa-
per-scissors style) and
their own unique require-
ments to achieve a critical
hit, there was a high level
of complexity that I found
deeply rewarding.
As well as the 50+
hours of main story, one
can choose to play through
the arcade mode, a series
of smaller missions which
upon completion you
receive various rewards.
Characters, as well as
a multitude of pages of
lore, can be unlocked
by playing the main
campaign. One could
also choose to play the
puzzle mode, a devilish
brain-teaser of an option
which poses puzzles
which you have to solve
given your knowledge
of the mechanics of the
game. These start off rel-
atively simple but quickly
grow to be insanely frus-
trating (in a good way).
My main complaint
about the gameplay would
have to be the artificial
difficulty settings. Rather
than being able to choose a
variety of difficulties that
reflect the intelligence of
the AI, you instead choose
difficulties which alter
the amount of damage
you receive/do. This is
understandable given the
small team that worked on
Wargroove, but a better
difficulty system would
have been great to see,
especially when I wanted
to up the difficulty on
completion of the game
but decided not to because
it just felt pointless.
What makes War-
groove really stand out
is its artistic value. By
this I mean the beautiful
sprite art, which in motion
feels much more realistic
than you would expect.
Weather changes cause
objects to move in the
wind, and the spray of
water as sea-based units
move is far too satisfying
to ignore. Being named
Wargroove, you would
expect to hear some
banging tunes. Well,
luckily, Chucklefish does
not disappoint. The songs
really set the mood of
battle incredibly well,
with a playfulness to them
that reminds you that it is
just a game, a playful one
at that. The light-hearted
nature of this game is re-
flected in its music and art
style and allows it to have
an almost Nintendo-like
charm. I compare War-
groove to Nintendo games
(as a massive fanboy
of Nintendo) because it
is just so chock-full of
things to do. When you
aren’t playing you can
read through all of the
lore or listen to the music
within the music player
menu. Alternatively, you
can marvel at the artwork,
including concept art for
all the characters.
After all of this though,
there is also a rich mul-
tiplayer mode. You can
design your own maps
in a level editor, which
I must say is top notch,
or play ready-made
maps against friends (or
strangers) online. The
technical level of players
is variable (you will get
your arse whooped) but
it is always fun, and you
never really feel like you
have been cheesed from a
victory. The multiplayer
is still thriving today and
hopefully with the free
DLC update (Feb 6th)
that introduces a whole
new faction and 2 new
units, there will be even
more returning players to
face.
After playing this
game to death and still not
getting bored, other than
the occasional insane dif-
ficulty spike and annoying
difficulty settings, I would
say that Wargroove is
excellent value for money.
It is available on PC, PS4,
Switch and Xbox One for
around $20. If you are a
fan of tactics games, or
just love a game with a
lot of charm (and dogs,
omg I forgot to mention
all the dogs), then I could
not recommend this any
more! 4/5 stars.
The characters in this game have so much...character! // Wargroove.com
