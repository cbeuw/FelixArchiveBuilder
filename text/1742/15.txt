There are few bigger
and more recognisable
brands in electrinic music
right now than Jordon
Alexander. With him
kicking off the year by re-
leasing two EPs in quick
succession, it seems like
a good time to see how
his sound has changed
over the past year, and
what that might mean for
the future. One thing is
for certain – the broody
overtones of his newest
releases haven’t come
out of nowhere. Looking
back, it was a dank and
grimy set in the sweltering
Parisian summer when I
first saw him.
He’s always had a
special energy in his live
sets. The kind of energy
that separates those who
can command a dance-
floor from pretenders. The
sun was beating down on
the plastic tarpaulin of
the little open tent which
gave shelter to fans of
anything with a four to
the floor at this mainly
rock-y festival. All eyes
were fixed on the slightly
raised, rudimentary metal
platform holding the DJ
booth. It almost felt like
the cigarettes he was
smoking were a wise
choice to filter out all
the dust in the air. The
epitome of focus, he kept
his moves simple. A little
back and forth, a little hair
flick here and there. Eyes
always on the decks. Like
two gleaming lumps of
coal.
The 26-year-old seems
to be maturing into a
superstar. Having put
out EPs quite prolifically
since becoming one of
the symbols of the lo-fi
house movement, he has
recently announced that
we should expect a full-
length album debut from
him at the end of this year.
By all indications, his
lo-fi days (a serendipitous
sonic achievement even-
tually copied by everyone
and their dog - now
something he wishes not
to identify with) are over.
The shift in his sound
started with the release of
the EP Moogie in May of
last year. Having collab-
orated with his long-time
friend and old roommate,
Nite Fleit, the record
carried on from his earlier
release that year under
his birth name. Carrying
a cover adorned with
something resembling
radioactive jellyfish, the
EP was not an explosive
release in any sense but it
did indicate a new trend.
Up to that point, it seemed
that with every release,
Alexander was trying to
change the soundscape
a little bit, while staying
within the sample house
category. It seemed as
though he was trying to
evade being pinned down
too much – a feat which
has definitely cemented
his status as one of the
more eclectic producers
of this era. With Growing
Pains following Moogie
after a matter of months,
he had added another
EP of the same ilk to his
discography. Describing
it as “Headbanging club
music” it was an im-
provement over Moogie.
He kept the rave sound
and made it more glitchy,
adding an interesting new
layer to the sound. The
opening track, sleepless,
stole the show, with
its swampy intro and
off-kilter kick during the
breakdown.
In December, he
released an EP called
Don’t Keep The Fire
Burning completely out
of the blue as a response
to the wildfires in Austral-
ia. Coming from someone
who likes to tease fans
by playing perpetually
unreleased material in
live sets, this 4-track
nugget seemed like pure
gold. The opener, Positive
Energy Forever is a
thumperofatrack.Agritty
combination of a bass
distorted to oblivion, a
nicely rhythmic arpeggio
and the perfectly faded
vocal sample drearily re-
peating “positive energy”

stomping kick, along with
the tempo increase we
already saw on his last
few efforts shows all go
a long way to confirming
that Jordon has managed
to find what he had been
looking for.
Exactly what that is
can be surmised from his
statements regarding his
musical influence. He had
had no problems showing
his love for old-school
house, disco (in his
releases with another one
of his friends, Loods), and
even grime (in the aptly
titled I’ve Always Liked
Grime). The Sunflower
EP, released last Friday,
is an indication that he
truly has embraced the
heavier side of electronic
music as well. The title
track flirts with rave but
only ever so slightly, in
the form of woodwind
synths which brush your
eardrums at the peak
of the track, when the
kick really bites down.
The next track, Hidden
Worlds, feature synths
which would not sound
out of place at the peak
acid-era Hacienda. On
Switchblade, he reverts to
a sample-based paradigm
more like his previous
sound. That is not the
main reason for the track
being the most unimpres-
sive of the bunch, as it
also sounds flat in many
parts. Luckily, he still
manages to finish with
a flourish with Leaving
Tokyo. The opening bars
sound like a cell phone
ringing underwater, and
then the broken beat
comes and sweeps you
away for four minutes
and seventeen seconds of
electro apocalypse.

worldwide phenomenon.
Sunflower was recorded
in what he says are two of
his favourite cities - New
York and Tokyo - but it
is the grittiness of his
hometown, the indus-
trial port of Newcastle,
Australia, which shines
through. It will certainly
be interesting to see how
many different sounds
and styles he manages to
incorporate into his full-
length debut and whether
he’ll be able to make it fit
together into a coherent
whole. That will, surely,
be a pivotal step on his
seemingly celestial rise.
