In-Silo Decision Making
I
think I’ve talked
about this before,
but I see no impli-
cation of it chang-
ing – so time to break it
down again.
There’s a fundamen-
tal flaw in the way the
College seems to make
decisions. Specifically,
the issue is that decisions
are made in very limited
‘silos’. Different areas of
the College’s operation
are divvied up and the
responsibility for them
is given to particular
areas or divisions. So, for
example, the halls rent
renegotiations are led by
Campus Services with
the oversight of senior
members of the College
such as the CFO or the
Provost.
This is fine. This is
efficiency. We had a
discussion in the Felix
office this week about
‘min-maxing’, or running
to optimal efficiency in
everything you do. It’s not
always positive, but in the
case of business, there’s
a lot to be said for that
approach. This is efficient
and expedient for quick
decision-making.
The problems come
when the silos don’t
talk to eachother and
make their decisions in a
complete vacuum. That’s
when quick decisions are
made, but not good ones
– because every decision
has ramifications beyond
just the limited remit
in which they are being
made.
I’m going to take the
halls rent example again.
The rent prices are being
increased significantly.
This is according to what
the College has described
as a “break-even” model,
in which revenue is
matched to cost, and what
the Union has described
as not actually being
break-even. Wherever
you fall in that debate, the
end result is rents hitting
around £300 per week in
South Kensington within
the next five or so years.
It’s hitting market rate, if
not possibly over.
This is very high.
Significantly above what
most students can afford
with just their mainte-
nance loan. Significantly
above even what many
international students
could afford. I don’t think
it is controversial to say
that this will price many
poor prospective students
out of halls.
Let’s put it this way,
anecdotally: I, who joined
in 2014, would almost
certainly reject my Impe-
rial offer if I were apply-
ing now, purely on the
financial level. I worked
between 20 and 45 hours
a week every week at the
bars while being a hall
senior during part of my
degree, just to get through.
Adding another 5 or 10
hours per week atop that,
as I’d have to do now, just
wouldn’t be feasible.
This decision was made
by the financial side of the
College just a couple of
months after the Office for
Students, the regulator for
English universities, had
essentially mandated them
to increase the number
of students from disad-
vantaged backgrounds
because those numbers
were so low.
To quote from the
DPW’s blog, “according
to the plan, considering
Undergraduate home
student admissions, there
is a gap between IMD Q1
and Q5 of 24.8% and
POLAR4 Q1 and Q5
by 54.2%.” For reference,
IMD and POLAR4 are
essentially indices of
deprivation and higher
education participation
respectively, with Q1 and
Q5 being the lowest and
highest quintiles.
From the College’s
Access to Participation
Plan, a five-year plan for
remedying this problem,
55% of students here are
from the top quintile of
POLAR4.
As a personal opinion:
those numbers are pretty
shocking.
And this is just weeks
after the Union has
established a Working
Class officer for the same
reason – hence the DPW’s
blog quote above.
Now think: can you
even imagine what the
people responsible for
fixing that are feeling
in the light of these rent
debates and decisions?
Would that not just be the
most frustrating thing in
the world? I can’t speak
for them – and if you are
a member of staff working
on this, please do contact
me with your thoughts off-
the-record – but it’s just so
obviously the College as
an institution chasing two
totally misaligned goals.
I don’t feel like these
two groups of people are
talking. I don’t see how
they can be. The fact that
a decision got a bigger
Excel spreadsheet number
is great for finance, but
that it utterly screwed over
another major goal of the
College doesn’t seem to
be a factor in determining
whether that was a good
call.
It’s not the only case of
in-silo decision making.
It’s something that’s
popped up in quite a few
News articles and inves-
tigations this year. And
it’s making things very
difficult for many people,
as different areas of the
College push-and-pull on
the same issue, trying to
influence it in different
directions for their own
goals and purposes. That,
then, destroys efficiency.
I would argue that this
is partly the role of the
Strategies – to provide a
unified goal for different
divisions of the College to
base their decision-mak-
ing on. That’s great. But
what’s better is having a
decision-making structure
that involves people
from multiple areas, with
multiple goals, having an
input at an early stage.
Decisions should not be
made so unilaterally in an
organisation with such a
diverse range of pressures
and requirements.
That’s important to
note. None of this is easy.
A university has a very
difficult job of keeping
itself solvent, managing
relationships with various
stakeholders internal and
external, and looking after
its students. A corporation
doesn’t have that problem,
and neither does a school.
It’s a unique position to
be in, especially when
confronted with colos-
sal threats like Brexit.
There’s no “handbook”
for that, no pocket guide,
and fundamentally people
are often doing the best
they can.
So don’t get me wrong
– I think this can read as
critical. In a way, it is – I
am saying that the deci-
sions being made are bad,
I suppose. Or certainly
have been made with a
limited scope in mind.
But the issue doesn’t
really lie on individuals,
it lies in decision-making
structures that have risen
organically and before
most of the senior people
in the College were even
in their roles. It’s not a
malicious thing, or even a
question of incompetence.
If anything, it’s a
culture change that needs
to happen. But rolling
that out is an enormous
challenge.
We can see approaches
to this being developed
on the departmental
level – explorations of
sharing space between
departments, led by Chris
Banks, for example. There
is work on this. But it
needs to be recognised
as a serious problem and
serious work needs to be
done to roll it out across
every level of College.
