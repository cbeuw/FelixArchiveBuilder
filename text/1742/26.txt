n a recent interview
with the Financial
Times, Sajid Javid,
the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, warned
businesses that the gov-
ernment wished to diverge
from EU regulations
following Britain’s exit
from the European Union.
Representatives from the
automotive and aerospace
industry immediately
expressed their concern,
prompting Mr. Javid to
provide assurances that
the government will adopt
a cautious approach in
subsequent interviews.
Regulatory divergence
will have an impact on
all sectors, especially
on financial services.
According to the House
of Commons Library’s
records, financial services
accounted for 6.9% of
total economic output in
2018, which underscores
the sector’s importance to
the UK’s economy.
Predicted Future Rela-
tionship
According to the
political declaration
regarding Britain’s future
relationship with the
EU, access to Europe’s
financial markets will be
granted using an “equiva-
lence system”. Under this
system, the EU allows
third countries access
to its financial markets
if countries’ regulations
align with the EU’s reg-
ulatory framework. The
Chancellor has stated that
this system allows the UK
to adopt its own regula-
tions, but it must ensure
their outcomes are equiv-
alent to those produced by
the EU’s rulebook. This
approach will certainly
provide more flexibility to
the UK. However, there is
no guarantee that the EU
will agree to this plan.
Even if it does agree with
it, the EU will probably
be able to limit Britain’s
access in the case of
regulatory divergence.
The government expects
an agreement on the form
of the future relationship
to be finalized by the end
of the year, which many
consider an overly ambi-
tious deadline.
The Case for Alignment
The case for remaining
as aligned as possible
with EU regulations is
not difficult to argue for.
Established financial
institutions will face
significant obstacles
in offering services to
European customers if
the UK were to no longer
have access to European
financial markets. Con-
sequently, the trend of
relocation to competing
financial centres, such
as Frankfurt and Paris,
would significantly exac-
erbate, thus endangering
a larger number of jobs in
the sector. Having to deal
with two widely different
legal frameworks would
certainly discourage inter-
strive to ensure their
products comply with
both EU and UK rules, in
addition to the costs due
to the trade barriers that
will be likely be intro-
duced. All these costs will
eventually result in higher
prices for consumers and
a reduction in earnings,
which will discourage in-
vestment from the public
in these companies.
The Case for Diver-
gence
Diverging from EU
regulations will not nec-
essarily be harmful to all
sectors of the economy.
Particularly, the technol-
ogy sector could benefit
from a shift away from the
current European frame-
work, which is viewed as
restrictive by many voices
in the tech community.
Recent examples include
articles 11 and 13 of the
controversial copyright
law along with announce-
ments about banning the
use of facial recognition
in public spaces. By
diverging from EU
standards, the UK could
become a testing ground
for upcoming technolo-
gies, such as driverless
cars, robotics, and AI.
This spur of technolog-
ical innovation would
also benefit the fintech
sector Tailoring new
technologies to the needs
of the banking sector
would facilitate further
growth and more effective
competition with China
and the US, regardless
of whether access to EU
markets has been main-
tained or not. The UK’s
leading pharmaceutical
industry could be further
boosted in the case of
divergence. The ability of
the UK to develop its own
regulations for pharma-
ceutical products would
facilitate harmonisation
with the regulatory regime
of other nations, whose
markets UK pharmaceu-
tical companies want to
access post-Brexit. Given
that UK’s Medicines and
Healthcare Products Reg-
ulatory Agency (MHRA)
is a highly respected
body worldwide, the EU
will most likely wish to
continue its cooperation
with it. As a result, the UK
would maintain a large
number of EU rules, while
crafting others of its own
in an effort to back British
interests. It is hence
possible that both sectors
could represent significant
investing opportunities
moving forward.
Conclusion
To conclude, it is
apparent that a nuanced
approach should be
adopted. The UK should
be careful not to diverge
just for the sake of it; a
sudden shift in policy will
likely cause significant
short and medium-term
damage, especially in
financial services and
export-dependent sectors.
Securing a trade deal
with the US, which is
frequently cited as the
main argument in favour
of extensive deregulation,
may require a policy shift
in industries such as food
processing. Deregulating
such a sector would face
opposition from a broad
swathe of public opinion.
Considering that the list
of the top ten UK export
destinations includes
seven EU countries, and
Switzerland, which is a
member of the European
Economic Area, a sudden
disruption in trading
relationships due to di-
vergence from European
standards would likely
offset or even outweigh
the gains expected by
this decision. All of these
factors suggest it would
be in the interests of the
UK ‘s economy for the
country to remain in close
alignment with the EU, at
least in the short term.
