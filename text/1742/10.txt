L
ast Tuesday, the
4th February the
Imperial College
C o n s e r v a t i v e
Society hosted one of the
most controversial char-
acters of British politics,
Jacob Rees-Mogg.
The MP for North East
Somerset currently serves
as Leader of the House
of Commons and Lord
President of the Council,
but he is most known
for his ﬂamboyant and
sometimes old-fashioned
vocabulary. Among other
occasions, he often distin-
guishes himself in debates
in the House of Commons,
sometimes without even
a word, like the time he
was reprimanded for lying
on the bench during the
Brexit bill debate. He is
not new to controversy,
particularly those con-
cerning his strict Catholic
beliefs and how they tie in
with his view of politics
and economics.
Mr Rees-Mogg,
visitor to our university,
showed up a little late
to the event, apparently
due to a cabinet meeting
in which he and Mr
Johnson were probably
discussing new ways of
making the UK great
again. After a brief in-
troduction by the Chair
of the Conservative
Society, he began his
speech which touched
on several points, from
the opportunities Brexit
offers to the intolerance
of socialists. He also
took the opportunity to
praise Imperial College
as one of the most out-
standing universities in
the world, and that he
believes in our success
in any industry we enter.
Afterwards, the
audience was given
the opportunity to ask
questions and mine was
among the ones chosen.
Here’s what I asked:
“You have praised our
university for its inter-
national status. Now,
with Brexit having
just occurred, which
measures will be taken
concretely in order to
guarantee that universi-
ties like Imperial, deeply
reliant on EU staff
and students, maintain
their research level and
indeed international
status?”
In his answer, Mr Re-
es-Mogg declared that
universities are at the
forefront of what will be
a “global Britain”, that
the UK should hence
focus in looking at coun-
tries like India, which
represent the future,
rather than at the “nar-
row-focused” European
Union, which instead
represents the past. He
then praised the ability
of Imperial to fund itself
through several sources
rather than depending
exclusively on public
finances. No words were
dedicated to the fact
that the future of many
research programmes
in partnership with the
narrow-focused EU,
which actually greatly
benefit British univer-
sities, could come to an
end depending on the
results of the impending
negotiations.
After the question
session finished it was
time for the raffle. A
series of prizes were
offered, which ranged
from chauvinistic Union
Jacks to, more ironi-
cally, EU gadgets and
leftist books. Drawing
the winning tickers
was of course the guest
of honor. With ticket
number 152, I was lucky
enough to win a copy of
“The Communist Man-
ifesto” by Karl Marx
and Friedrich Engels.
Part of the prize was an
inscription:
“Luca, This is not an
important one. - Jacob
Rees-Mogg”.
Although overtly sa-
tirical, I found it striking
that a person who studied
history could write such
a statement, even as a
poor joke. I am certainly
not a communist or a so-
cialist, but I find absurd
that the work of a phi-
losopher whose thought
has profoundly shaped
the last two centuries
which Democrat Trump
should face in the US
presidential elections,
which minister should
be kicked out, and more.
In a question about
what issue people most
agreed with, at first
place was freedom of
speech, ranked above
capitalism, immigration
control, and Brexit.
I thought about that
on my way home. While
it is true that some
fringes of the left are
deeply intolerant, it is
also true that that many
people on the right
are too, one of them
currently in Downing
Street. I then ask, can’t
this invaluable freedom
be upheld without the
degrading the rigor of
political debate with
useless, dangerous
offenses and populist
slogans?
Jacob Rees-Mogg answers questions from the audience // Isabelle Zhang
is described as so. Not
to mention the fact that
the person who wrote so
had also recently written
a book about the Vic-
torian Age, the period
in which Marx’s theory
and the entire socialist
movement developed
and had clear impact.
Right after having my
new book signed, I left
as a queue formed to
take selfies and speak
with Mr Rees-Mogg.
To end these remarks
on a more positive
note, I would like to
thank the Chair of the
Conservative Society
for giving me a chance
to ask a question. I also
recognise that the event
was well organised and
I cannot imagine how
much effort was required
to set it up. What was
memorable was the
Mentimeter poll set up at
the event’s start, which
asked questions such as:
what the most important
issues the government
should be dealing with,
“He began his
speech... and
also took the
opportunity to
praise Imperial
College as one
of the most
outstanding
universities in
the world ”
“I was lucky
enough to win
a copy of“The
Communist
Manifesto”
by Karl Marx
and Friedrich
Engels as a
raffle prize ”
