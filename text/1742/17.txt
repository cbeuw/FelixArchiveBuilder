17
deserving films at this year’s Academy Awards
“For sheer
cleverness and
enjoyment
alone, Knives

of acclaim ”
“Adam Driver’s
colossal
performance

excellent

multitude of emotions to
bounce between her and
Diver, and we think she
should win.
Best Original Screen-
play
Another first in our
indecisive, meandering
account of the awards,
we have a three-way tie.
As this award considers
both storyline and script,
we find it harder to decide
which one impressed us
most.
On dialogue alone, we
would give it to Noah
Baumbach for Marriage
Story, where powerhouse
perfomances relied
heavily on excellent
dialogue in brilliantly
written scenes.
For sheer cleverness
and enjoyment alone,
Knives Out had a storyline
that is worthy of the
acclaim associated with
Best Original Screenplay,
and we think it would be
a shame if this film went
the entire awards season
unrecognised, poor Rian
Johnson.
Of course, as with every
Tarantino film, Once
Upon a Time... in Holly-
wood has its own circle
of praise from amateurs
and critics alike. One of
the standout features of
Tarantino’s filmmaking is
consistently the script, and
this is no exception, with
an intricate plot and, at
times, hilarious dialogue,
it’s equally deserving of
this award.
Best Adapted Screen-
play
Charlotte will take
the reigns here: having
desperately speed-read
the book in time for the
film’s release, I feel quite
confident in saying that
Greta Gerwig crafted a
wonderful interpretation
of Little Women. She
made the film her own
with a dual-narrative that
did not exist in the source
material. I’ve heard
people claim that this
made the film ‘too confus-
ing’, but as someone who
could decipher the change
between long-haired Jo
and short-haired Jo, I
simply disagree. In this
way, she added texture
to a story that has been
reproduced many times
before and achieved it
perfectly. Furthermore,
for someone who has read
the novel and watched
the film, the final scene
was a surprising addition,
deviating from the book,
that rounded the film off
perfectly poignantly.
It’s hard to comment on
this award without having
read the source material,
and so we can’t discuss
the other nominees.
Best Supporting Ac-
tor & Actress
We think Brad Pitt
should get it, we want
Brad Pitt to get it, and we
think Brad Pitt will get
it. Arguably the leading
character in Once Upon
a Time... in Hollywood,
Brad shone in his role as
Cliff Booth, Rick Dalton’s
(Leonardo DiCaprio)
stunt double. Whilst Leo
was as consistently excep-
tional as ever, the fact that
Brad Pitt stands out as the
main character in this film
gives every indication that
this was an incredible per-
formance, and he should
receive this award.
Likewise for Laura
Dern: we think, we want,
we will get. With support-
ing roles in Little Women
and Marriage Story, she
has opened herself up for
praise this awards season,
giving two brilliant per-
formances. For Marriage
Story in particular, she
was hilarious, and despite
having very little screen-
time, she left lasting
impressions, providing
levity in an otherwise
intense film.
Best Cinematography
As Charlotte did for
Adapted Screenplay, Dom
shall do for Cinematogra-
phy.
It goes without much
discussion, that for me
Roger Deakins (1917) is
highly deserving of Best
Cinematography this year.
While other films excelled
in picturesque shots,
excellent lighting, and
pleasing colour palettes,
1917 had all three. It’s
easy to just focus on the
continuous shot as the
main feature of this film,
but with dawn shots filling
the sky in deep blues, and
burning buildings illumi-
nating the set, there really
was the whole package
delivered here. The con-
tinuous shot just provided
more reason for praise,
and left me wondering
how they did it.
Best of the rest
For the remaining cat-
egories, we don’t really
feel qualified to talk as in
depth about them as we
should, but that doesn’t
mean that we won’t
blindly try to.
For Best Score,
we’d love to see Hildur
Guðnadóttir take it home
for Joker; her string
arrangements provided
a refreshing take on the
usual orchestrated scores.
For Best Costume
Design we have to give
it to Jacqueline Durran
for Little Women, whose
pieces added a perfect
prettiness to the film. An
honourable mention, and
perhaps dark horse, goes
to Arianne Phillips for
Once Upon a Time... in
Hollywood and her killer,
late 60’s outfits (could be
refreshing to see this win).
For sheer transporta-
tion to the time period,
we have to give Best
Production Design to the
team on Once Upon a
Time... in Hollywood; the
dreamy 60’s set just had
us lusting to live in that
era of Hollywood.
Having exhausted our
word count, knowledge,
and energy, we’ve now
run out of space to blindly
guess at who should
receive the Oscars this
year. In truth, we don’t
know. And in honesty, we
don’t care. Let’s just see
on Sunday.
