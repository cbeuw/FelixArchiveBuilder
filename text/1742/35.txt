I
’ve been volunteering
with the Union since
my ﬁrst year. There
have been ups and
downs, but overall, I’ve
had a great time. I’ve met
about 90% of my good
friends at Imperial through
being a rep; Union work
has been my main “So
what do you like to do
in your free time?” thing,
and some of my best life
achievements have been
through my role. It is fair
to say that being a Union
volunteer has shaped my
University experience and
life in general so much
that I can’t even imagine
what I’d be doing now if I
hadn’t become a year rep
three and a half years ago.
There can be many
reasons why one would
become a volunteer, for
the Union or for any other
organisation. You might
want to improve things or
help other people, volun-
teer because your friends
are doing it, perhaps you
just want to boost your
CV and learn some new
skills, or maybe there just
isn’t anyone else who
could do it and you care
too much to leave the spot
unoccupied and see your
club or society fail.
No matter what your
primary motivation is,
you need two key things
to stay driven for long
organise free bar nights,
arrange a trip abroad and
have great publicity and
make all of the money
along the way to be able
to deliver even more next
time. That’s why people
voted for us anyway,
right?
While focused on
our main objective of
delivering results, we
often lose sight of our
most important asset – the
people we are working
with. There might be a
lot of tension over small
(or big) problems, and
while striving for perfec-
tion, things can get very
personal – we just want to
get the job done and often
forget we are dealing
with individuals with
real feelings that can get
hurt. We end up achieving
great measurable results
but leave a bitter aftertaste
of broken interpersonal
relationships.
Maybe we should try to
prioritise people’s feelings
a bit more when making
decisions. Being happy in
your role is not only good
for your wellbeing, but it
also keeps you motivated
to continue working in
the future and makes you
more likely to have a keen
successor. A happy com-
mittee is the key to overall
success, and it should be
the thing we measure and
take seriously alongside
other achievements.
So, if you are consider-
ing running in this year’s
Leadership Elections
(and you totally should)
remember that sometimes
the real success should
be the friends you make
along the way.

periods of time and gen-
erally have a good time
volunteering:
- See the results of your
work and achieve things
you can be proud of
- Have good relation-
ships with the people you
are working with
It’s probably not hard
to guess which of these
two is, usually, more im-
portant to most volunteers
at Imperial, a university
which ranks among the
best for research and
academic achievements,
and among the worst for
student satisfaction.
We’ve become overly
obsessed with measura-
ble success; we want to
deliver the best events and
sell all of the tickets, offer
subsidised hoodies and
