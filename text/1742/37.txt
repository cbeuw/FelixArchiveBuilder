HANGMAN
Crisis of confidence
engulfs Imperial
undergraduates as
they ask themselves
who is to blame for
their situation

Editor-in-Chief
T
he ongoing
efforts by the
Union to re-
sist proposed
increases in halls rents
has caused many stu-
dents to reconsider their
prejudices. Hating the
Union having long been
such a default position,
students are struggling
to adjust to the news
that the Union might
be doing something for
them.
Though some students
are pleased to hear that
their interests are being
represented others have
clung on to their old atti-
tudes.
NegaFelix reporters
found Tarlie Chitmuss
hiding in a lower base-
ment of Blackett, wearing
a tinfoil hat and muttering
“It’s all a ruse! They’re all
in on it!” over and over
again.
Others have been able
to cling to their sanity but
have suffered huge trust
crises, turning their ire on
anyone in reach.
Third year Materials
student Feb Senton
referred himself to the
College counselling
service after suffering
from crippling cognitive
dissonance. “I was suffer-
ing. My nadir came when
I accused a man in a Mr
Whippy van of ruining my
last piece of coursework”
Senton’s experience
is not atypical. Though
studies are sparse, an-
ecdotal evidence points
towards rocketing levels
of imposter syndrome.
Students that were once
able to get by just mut-
tering “Bloody College”
or “Bloody Union” under
their breath have also
been caught out by the
recent increase in student
engagement.
“I used to be consid-
ered pretty clued in” said
one such student “but I’ve
had to stop because it is
now met with genuine
opinions. I thought the
Union was just the place
to get beer.”

mental health problems!
