A
s a Swifty
myself I an-
ticipated her
documentary
with silent gasps and
screams since the release
of the trailer - she is an
artist with whom I have
grown up; every album
of hers reminds me of a
distinct part of my own
journey. Having a lens
into the behind-the-scenes
of her journey is some-
thing I’m sure many of
us looked forward to. But
at the same time, I could
not help but wonder what
I could expect since, as
a celebrity, a huge part
of her life is already
public. Nevertheless, the
documentary fulfills its
purpose, delivering a soft
and endearing narrative
and filling in the missing
pieces of who we perceive
Taylor Swift to be.
The Netflix film is
structured chronologi-
cally and describes her
struggles and revelations
in every stage of her life,
starting off with her debut
and early success, where
she lived for the approval
of others. Instead of con-
fronting her insecurities
head on, she interpreted it
as a sign that she needed to
work hard to be deserving,
which translated into her
diligent work ethic and
body image issues. Even
at the peak of her career,
she recalled, she had no
one to share that with.
“It fulfills
its purpose,
delivering
a soft and
endearing
narrative”
That insecurity is deeply
rooted in how women are
treated unequally espe-
cially in the entertainment
industry, which is why
now she has chosen to
stand up and voice out her
stance.
It covers many con-
troversial incidents or
“feuds” in which Swift
was involved, from Kanye
West interrupting her
speech at the 2009 MTV
Video Music Awards,
her switch from country
to pop music, her feud
resulting #TaylorSwiftO-
verParty trending all over
the internet, and her sexual
assault case against David
Mueller. In MissAmerica-
na, we get a peek into her
side of the story, which is
often raw and vulnerable.
We’ve had glimpses in the
past, but this gives us a
clear answer, a transparent
outlook to her personal
life.
As a documentary
centered around a pop
artist, the music is perfect-
ly intertwined with every
scene. I like how various
forms of the songs are
incorporated - the studio
version, live stages at
her concert, or a random
recording playing from
her phone. Almost every
favourite song of mine
was included, including
“Tim McGraw”, “All
Too Well,” and “Getaway
Car.” The fact that she
writes every song on her
album not only shows
how talented she is as an
artist but also reflects all
parts of her journey - you
can hear her screaming her
loneliness in “Delicate,”
her transformation from
hatred to love in “Call It
What You Want,” her true
joy and contentedness in
her album Lover. Music
never lies, and Swift’s
speaks to her audience
so sincerely. The new
song “Only the Young”
included is such an
inspiring, upbeat, and mo-
tivational political anthem
that exemplifies the new
and reborn Taylor.
The highlight of Miss
Americana to me person-
ally is certainly towards
the end when Taylor Swift
chooses to go public with
the her political views,
from her urging her
younger audience to vote
to her staunch stance for
the LGBT community.
It’s truly a change from
her strict apolitical profile
in the past. Without her
constant need to be the
“nice girl,” she’s now
free to express her views,
unafraid of the potential
backlashes like the Dixie
Chicks received. The shift
is not sudden or without
reason, but is rather a
result of her going through
the David Mueller case.
It’s evident that she’s
tired of being in a position
capable of change and
impact but not do it.
All in all, Miss Amer-
icana delivers to the fan
something that we’ve all
wanted, the metamor-
phosis of the country
Taylor in her sparkly
dress and cowboy boots
to the 29-year-old Taylor
in her pajamas set, eating
burritos and speaking
up against misogyny. It
touches on topics, includ-
ing some centered around
mental health - dealing
with the fear of not being
good enough, the desire to
be liked, building our self-
worth on others’ approval,
while others more societal
and representative of con-
temporary female artists,
celebrities, and public
shaming. It’s not the
strongest of documenta-
ries nor the most touching
of topics, but nevertheless
it’s a genuine, compelling,
and vulnerable watch
that I’ll recommend to
everyone.
