Left Forum struggle to stay relevant
HANGMAN
In the aftermath of
a highly successful
TorySoc event, Left
Forum committee
members were left
scrabbling to retain
student attention

An emergency
commAn emergency
committee meeting, called
at the insistence of Deputy
Chairman (Tankies) Zisa-
belle Hang, was convened
in order to address falling
membership figures and a
growing feeling of irrele-
vance in the 21st
century.
Proposals ranged
widely from changing
the biscuit selection to
automatic non-opt-out-
able first-year student
enrolment. Sen Febton
proposed shooting
anybody that reported
membership numbers that
didn’t conform to the five
year plan. However, this
was later erased from the
minutes and defective
committee members were
assigned to shore up the
work in the Union offices
instead. Deliberations
took 5 weeks and it took
the three largest factions
banding together and
non-platforming their
opponents to achieve a
consensus. This was es-
pecially hard on the RMT
union representatives as
without a platform they
lostallleverage.Passenger
numbers arriving at South
Kensington plummeted.
One RMT representative
was observing, “well, at
least we’ve got the trains”
The newly formed and
victorious Imperial Com-
mittee of Committees
(ICoC) decided that the
Left Forum should have
their own event to show
the fascists that the Left
can have fun as well. Ex-
ecutive Chairman of the
ICoC Bansh Hatnagar de-
clared that the target quota
was eight fun per person
and commanded the Sub
Committee (Events)
((Fun)) (((Soros))) to get
to organising the event.
The 144th
Party Con-
ference was arranged
to go ahead that Friday.
Security was provided by
the Central Sub-Commit-
tee for the Peaceful Use
of Icepicks. All attendees
entered the fortified
compound via a long
tightrope, nicknamed the
“Party Line” and con-
stantly moving to the left.
Falling off was deemed
to be undeniable proof of
access and sent this report.
Stalls set up by the
various groups, looking
to influence Imperial left
wingers, handed out pam-
phlets and tried to sign
people up on their mailing
lists. There was uneven
take up and not every
group left the conference
happy. The Moët and Dom
Perignon representatives
admitted, however, that
they were quietly happy
at the reception they had
had and that they looked
forward to coming next
year.
The speaking schedule
which had been highly
anticipated was released
early on in the day and
was met with a mixed
response. Some applaud-
ed the bold interspecies
gesture of inviting John
McDonnell’s guinea pig

while others felt that
it only highlighted the
access problems that
remained for non-four-
legged animals.
A brief momment of
excitement arose after
disagreements over how
to pronounce the word
‘scone’ during the tea
break led to a sit in protest
by the “People’s Libera-
tion Scone Bomb Squad
(Marxist)”. The issue
was quickly resolved,
however.
The splinter group had
emergency meetings via
representatives of the Im-
perial College Carpenters
union. The talks were
successful and the group
declared that they “would
work again”.
