The Oscars: A discussion on our favourite and most
With The Oscars this Sunday, the Felix Film Editors are

year. We’ll be selecting which films we think will win, as
well as what we want to win; they’re seldom the same

“‘Love the
film, hate her’-
The Academy’s
response to
Greta’s snub”
W
ho better
to spout
unsolicited
opinions on
the 92ndAcademyAwards
than two people who’ve
individually seen less than
53% of the nominees?
However, combining our
watched lists we can brag
a whopping total of 55%
(statistics not verified).
Wielding our consumate
knowledge of these films,
and brandishing our blind
ignorance, we’re going to
go through each category
individually and tell you
what we want to win,
what we think is the most
deserving, and what the
actual verdict will be on
the night. So if you’re
planning on grabbing
some popcorn and sitting
wrapped in your duvet
at 2am, spare a thought
to what the Felix Film
Editors have to say about
each nomination, and
why we’ll be probably be
disappointed.
As this will no doubt
apply to many of our se-
lections, we must mention
the fact that we believe
this list would look dras-
tically different if we had
had the chance to watch
Parasite sooner than two
days before the ceremony.
Going off of unanimous
praise, we think it’s a film
that we will both enjoy
immensly.
Best Picture
Well this year the
nominations in this
category have just been
plain strange. With Jojo
Rabbit (in the words of
Charlotte, “Why?”); Le
Mans ‘66 (who saw this
film other than my dad?);
Joker (a box office banger
but bored us on the big
screen), some of the
nominations have been a
bit of a disappointment.
Taking spots where oth-
erwise deserving films
could’ve been given
their recognition, a lot
of cinema this year has
gone underappreciated
and underrepresented by
The Academy and awards
shows this season. With
this in mind, here are our
picks.
For what we would like
to win, Dom has chosen
Marriage Story. “One of
the most honest portray-
als of the hardships in
divorce, it deftly avoided
all the shortcomings that
could be found in the
sombre legal precedings.
Heart-warming and
heart-breaking, it was the
stand out film for me this
year.”
For Charlotte, she’s torn
between The Irishman
and Marriage Story. This
conflict was brought
into fruition because,
with the memory of an
overworked physicist,
details of Marriage Story
are foggy (“I know that I
loved Marriage Story at
the time, but four months
down the line I’m strug-
gling to justify why”).
However, with the images
still vivid in her mind,
Charlotte has dubbed The
Irishman as her Oscar
winner, “with the veteran
ensemble of actors and
legend Martin Scorsese
at the helm, this 3.5 hour
epic is more than deserv-
ing of its nomination.”
Despite our heartfelt
opinions, we’re (rather be-
grudgingly) expecting to
see 1917 take home Best
Picture this year. This isn’t
to say that it’s not a great
film with many excellent
aspects in its own right, it
just isn’t really something
we haven’t seen before
(war films, single takes?
Been there, done that).
It’s almost like a facto-
ry-made film, tailored for
The Academy; we’d like
to have some more variety
rather than the same
‘grand-old-war-pic’, but
with foreshadowing from
the Golden Globes and the
BAFTAs, it’s not looking
likely.
Best Director
‘And The Academy
award for Best Director
goes to...Greta Gerwig’
Oh wait.
Upon hearing the
absense of a nomination
for Greta Gerwig (Little
Women) in the Best
Director category despite
the Best Picture and
Adapted Screenplay nom-
inations, we got in contact
with The Academy for
their explaination, the
email we received simply
said: “Love the film, hate
her”.
This year, with the ex-
ception of Bong Joon-ho,
the nominations in this
category just aren’t all that
exciting. Veterans Taranti-
no and Scorsese stumble
on into the last legs of
their careers, while Todd
Phillips breaks ground
with his first nomination.
It would nice to see Bong
win, but having not seen
it, Sam Mendes would
be Dom’s pick for most
deserving director.
“The film was massive-
ly enjoyable, and despite
lacklustre character
development and story,
the direction in 1917 was
phenomenal.”
Meanwhile, Char-
lotte goes with Martin
Scorsese, but wants it
known that she holds no
strong opinions on this
category and would be
equally enthused if none
of them won (Bong,
sweetie, I’m so sorry, but
I haven’t seen Parasite
yet).
Again, looking at this
through the eyes of The
Academy, we think that
Sam Mendes is most
likely to take home a win
this year.
Best Actor
Contrary to the
previous categories, we
are in agreement that we’d
both love to see Adam
Driver on the podium
this Sunday. His colossal
performance in Marriage
Story allowed the other
excellent displays from
Scarlett Johansson and
Laura Dern to orbit
around him, grounding
itself as both real and
moving. We’d really love
to see him win.
Putting this aside,
it goes without saying
that Joaquin Phoenix’s
performance in Joker was
nothing short of astound-
ing, simply disappearing
into the role, and we’re
placing our bets on him
to win. However, it’s
also worth noting that we
don’t think that this is his
best ever perfomance; The
Master and Her are two
examples of outstanding
displays of talent which
we believe to have been
more worthy. It will be
nice to see him finally get
an Oscar he deserves.
Best Actress
As self-confessed
lovers of Saoirse Ronan,
god, we’d really like to see
her win this for her role
in Little Women. As one
of the best, young talents
in film today, she simply
melts into every role. For
each film, it almost feels
as though she really has
become character, no
longer in the domain of
acting; she is Jo March,
she is Lady Bird. She
remains so in-touch with
the character, it’s easy to
forget she’s acting, and
so her perfomance can be
easily dismissed as un-
derstated, with no distinct
standout moments.
In contrast with this,
we have Scarlett Johans-
son, who in this instance,
showcased a somewhat
more performative role.
It did not have the same
effect as Ronan playing Jo
March, where the actress
becomes the character,
but objectively this was
a more clear display
of talent than Ronan’s
nuanced style. Johansson
really wore heart on her
sleeve for this, allowing a
Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood // Sony Pictures
