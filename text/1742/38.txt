Hi Puzzlers!
Have you been well? Weâ€™ve been on a puzzles spree
the last few weeks - so, here you go, almost 2 pages
of puzzles. Again.
Weâ€™ve got a new trivia contributer, HaarMeasure!
Congrats to Lochy Monsters and DQ for being the
two teams that were able to weave through the
nonogram last week, we will continue to make puz-
zles varied and difficult.
New puzzle this week: a word search with cryptic
clues.
