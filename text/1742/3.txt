T
he College
has decided to
proceed with a
financial model
for halls rent prices over
the next five years, in
spite of Union Council
voting once again to
reject the model for
raising prices beyond
what they considered
affordable.
The final model is a
modified version of the
original proposal deliv-
ered in early December,
but with a new £3 million
reduction spread over 5
years. £2 million of the
reduction would equate
to the second proposal
given in January – which
would see prices increase
by 5.5% per year for
three years then 2.5% for
the remaining two. The
remaining £1 million will
be distributed across the 5
years in an unconfirmed
way.
This new proposal
was delivered to the
Union’s representatives
in the negotiation – the
President and Deputy
President (Welfare) – just
a few hours before the
‘Emergency Meeting’
of the Union Council on
Tuesday 4th February,
and overrode a tentative
agreement set up just the
previous day with Col-
lege’s Campus Services.
The Union Council
additionally rejected this
new model, despite the
reduction, because the
underlying “break-even”
financial model – which
they have heavily criti-
cised and claim is not truly
“break even” – remains
the same. Additionally,
they cited a lack of trans-
parency on the College’s
behalf, as multiple re-
quested documents have
not been delivered.
They offered this state-
ment on behalf of Union
Council:
“The Union believes
that first year halls of res-
idence are a crucial part
of the student experience
and, as such, should be
genuinely affordable for
all. College should engage
the Union in meaningful
transparent negotiation
surrounding halls prices
including the financial
model and potential
subsidy. As part of this,
College should be forth-
coming with all requested
information to allow the
Union to make informed
decisions. Negotiations
to date have not met these
criteria and the proposed
prices are not genuinely
affordable.”
After voting to reject
the proposal, the Council
voted to establish an
‘Imperial Cut the Rent’
campaign, which will be
student-led and run by a
committee comprising
its members, and took
indicative (in other words,
non-binding) votes on
whether or not to endorse
a spectrum of various
options for further action
– which had been collated
at an open but non-manda-
tory meeting the previous
week.
The actions which
passed included lobbying
the College and individual
members of the College,
creating publicity ma-
terials and social media
campaigns – including
some targeted at prospec-
tive students - and seeking
external support, includ-
ing approaching national
press.
Two more drastic
measures were also en-
dorsed: firstly, exploring
options for conducting

The College will continue with their final proposal for halls rent prices, despite the Union Council’s third rejection
of the model in an ‘Emergency Meeting’. In response, they have begun an ‘Imperial Cut the Rent’ campaign
“This new
proposal was
delivered to
the Union's
representati-
ves just a few
hours before
the Council”
endorsing demonstra-
tions or sit-ins – on the
grounds that these are
reactive measures that any
campaign would not need
Union support or endorse-
ment on. Furthermore, a
campaign encouraging
students to give low NSS
scores was rejected due to
academic representatives
on the Council stating that
it would damage relation-
ships with departments,
within which there are
many supporters of lower
rents, and additionally
could reduce the useful-
ness of NSS scores in
identifying departmental
problems.
The ‘Emergency
Meeting’ – an extra one
not scheduled at the start
of the year – was set up
to discuss the proposals,
and to discuss potential
further actions. The latter
discussion had been
postponed following the
previous Council meeting
two weeks prior, due to
many Council members
feeling uncomfortable
with having to discuss
potential further actions
without much notice.
Several additionally
stated that they felt
uncomfortable making
decisions in the Emergen-
cy Meeting, having only
seen the new proposal
and the options for further
action at the beginning of
the meeting. Their con-
cerns have been addressed
in the Constituent Union
section of Felix this week.
Additionally, the Union
President, Abhijay Sood,
has contributed to the
Comment section this
week, addressing various
aspects of the negotia-
tions.
The College did not
offer a statement.
“After
rejecting, the
Council voted
to establish
a student-
led 'Imperial
Cut the Rent
campaign'”
rent strikes in the future;
and secondly, establishing
a network of Union-vetted
private landlords who can
offer alternative accom-
modation to halls.
The vote for this latter
option was a controversial
one – out of 31 attending
members, nine voted in
favour, four voted against,
and the rest abstained,
meaning the vote passed
predominantly due to
abstentions.
Options that were
discussed but not voted
on include officially
