An introduction to interview and dining etiquette

H
ave you ever
been invited to
a job interview?
Well, if you
haven’t so far, imagine
that you were to attend
an interview followed by
a lunch. How would you
say hello? How would you
behave at the table? What
are the do’s and do nots?
In the following, we want
to introduce you to what
many students don’t know
and what they will learn
once they start working:
etiquette in two scenarios.
1st scenario: a typi-
cal job interview
Imagine you are
applying for your most
wanted job and you are
finally invited to attend a
personal interview. How
exciting! But do you also
know how to make a good
impression?
It all starts with the first
impression. No boss likes
waiting, so you should
arrive well in advance to
an interview with your
potential boss.
If you take public trans-
portation to get there, take
a bus or train that arrives
at least 30 minutes in
advance. If you have a car
or bike, check the parking
spots and to which facility
or office you must go.
Keep in mind that compa-
nies can be huge and the
respective office could be
at the opposite end of the
facility. For appropriate
clothing, you can always
call the reception to ask
about the usual dress
code. You should be at
least one style level above
the company’s usual dress
code to show that you
value the company and its
employees.
Once you’ve managed
to arrive, register at the
reception so that your in-
terviewer can be informed
about your arrival. After-
wards, the interviewer is
probably going to pick
you up. He or she will then
bring you to the interview
area. This is normally the
time for handshakes and
small talk.
If you are sitting while
being offered a handshake,
stand up. Also make sure
that your hand is dry even
if it might be a hot day
and you are sweating. Ad-
ditionally, be aware that
there is a certain hierarchy
you must follow when
performing a handshake.
Usually, the host offers his
guests the handshake and
the more senior person
reaches for the less senior
person’s hand. This means
that an older man offers a
younger man the hand, a
lady offers a man of any
age the hand and an older
lady offers a younger lady
“Be aware
that there
is a certain
hierarchy
you must
follow when
performing a
handshake”
“There may be
several sets
of silverware
but a general
rule of thumb
is to work your
way from the
outside in”
the hand.
Don’t try to force a
handshake. If several
people are offering you
a handshake, take the
first one that is offered
to you. Never decline a
handshake that is offered
to you, unless you have a
good reason, like you are
sick. A situation where
you decline the handshake
of a gentleman to one to
a lady might make the
gentleman feel uncom-
fortable and the lady a
little strange.
Furthermore, let the
handshake be a solid one,
which would not seem like
you are being offered a
dead fish or that you want
to destroy the extended
hand. Don’t shake the
hand longer than five
seconds. Keep eye contact
with the inviting person to
avoid staring at your own
beautiful hand. Introduce
yourself with your name
and keep in mind that a
real professional would
repeat the name of the
person he is shaking hands
with. This is a good way
of signalling our brain to
remember the name.
Afterwards, the inter-
viewer may ask you how
you are doing, if it was
easy to find your way to
the building or something
similar. Please be aware
that this is the wrong
moment to complain about
any inconveniences you
have experienced earlier
this day. You should reply
that everything went fine
since you want to show
that you are a person
who can handle stressful
situations and knows how
to make a proper small
talk. Don’t hesitate to
ask a question in return if
you feel the need to, since
this demonstrates your
self-confidence.
It is recommended to
have a fresh breath. It’s a
well-known tip amongst
experts to have pepper-
mint candy or chewing
gum in your pocket, but
don’t forget to finish it
or take it out before you
meet your interviewer.
If you are offered a
beverage, you can decide
whether or not you want
to accept it. There is no
right or wrong here.
The interview itself
will not be covered in this
article but we recommend
you to be confident and
polite to leave a good
impression.
After the interview,
be sure to say goodbye
properly by looking into
the eyes when giving an
appropriate handshake, as
discussed before.
2nd scenario: a
casual dinner during
an assessment centre
Now imagine that the
interview went great and
that you can consider
yourself a master of giving
handshakes. Instead of
sending you home, your
potential boss invites you
to a lunch in a restaurant
with some potential col-
leagues. This might sound
amazing for some people,
but for others it might be
quite stressful: what do
you do in the case you
don’t like the food offered
or if you are allergic to it?
If you are allergic to
any food, don’t hesitate to
tell the host or the waiter,
since it can endanger your
health. Usually there are
lots of different dishes
even at restaurants spe-
cialised in something like
seafood.
There are a few things
that you need to know
about rules at lunch table.
Good etiquette can be im-
pressive but it should lead
to a pleasant time where
you enjoy food together.
It is recommended to
mute your mobile and
even better, to not use it in
the presence of others as
it is very impolite. Once
the table is set, wait to be
seated or wait for what
your host. If he sits down,
you can sit down as well.
You should sit up straight,
but comfortably. If there
is a napkin on your plate
or next to it, you should
put it on your lap right
away. You will use this
one napkin to wipe your
mouth when needed
during the meal.
In the Western world,
there is usually a plate
and next to it at least one
fork and knife. Cutlery
for desserts is usually
placed on the top side of
your plate. A soup spoon
would be placed on the
right-hand side. There
may be several sets of sil-
verware but a general rule
of thumb is to work your
way from the outside in.
If you are not sure which
cutlery to use, just have
a look around you and
observe what other people
are doing. On the top right
of your plate, there will be
a water glass and a wine
glass. On the top left you
could find a small plate
with a small knife, which
is for bread and butter.
During the meal keep
your elbows off the table,
since it is considered to be
impolite. While you are
chewing it is good to keep
your wrists on the table.
When it comes to spoons,
everything that is served
in a bowl or boolean cup
is supposed to be eaten
with one. Be careful that
the meal is not too hot to
avoid burning yourself.
Also, don’t salt your food
before trying it, since a
hiring manager may think
that you’d rather make
assumptions than deci-
sions based on fact and
this could have a negative
impact on their decision. It
may also be disrespectful
for the chef. Once you’ve
tried the food and still find
it to be underseasoned for
your taste, you can ask for
salt and pepper.
Chew with your mouth
closed and avoid making
unpleasant noises at any
time. Furthermore, you
should avoid talking
