is shorter lived, but far
more potent than carbon
dioxide. Cutting down
your beef consumption
on its own can lead to a
significant shrinking of
your carbon footprint.
A 2014 study by
Scarborough et al.
surveyed over 50,000
Brits including a rep-
resentative numbers of
vegans, vegetarians,
pescetarians and meat
eaters. They compared
the age-and-sex-adjust-
ed mean greenhouse gas
emissions associated
with each of these diets
and found that the
equivalent number of
kilograms of carbon
dioxide per day was
7.19 for high volume
meat eaters (more than
100 g per day), 5.63 for
moderate meat eaters
(50-99 g), 4.67 for low
volume meat eaters
(less than 50 g), 3.91
for pescetarians, 3.81
for vegetarians and 2.89
for vegans. This implies
that even someone who
eats a moderate amount
of meat can almost half
the carbon footprint as-
sociated with their diet
by becoming vegan.
I am sure some
readers will call me
out for hypocrisy, but I
didn’t admit that I still
help my uncle out every
Christmas (by far the
busiest time of year)
for a couple of days.
Sometimes helping
your family has to come
above your lifestyle
choices.
On a similar note, I
am very much in support
of flexible veganism,
sometimes referred to
as freeganism. If your
flatmate is about to
throw out some cheese
they don’t want, why
not eat it? If you visit a
friend’s house and they
cook you something
non-vegan by accident,
are you really going to
be so rude as to reject
it? Someone who is
vegan for environmental
reasons may be willing
to ‘freegan’, as waste is
more of a concern than
philosophical consid-
erations about whether
animal products should
ever be consumed.
Someone who is vegan
primarily to reduce
animal suffering may
well differ in opinion, of
course.
In recent years,
many people have
brandished the envi-
ronmental movement
a failure, pointing out
“I am very
much in
support
of flexible
veganism,
sometimes
referred to as
freeganism”
how, despite its exist-
ence, global emissions
have continued to rise
steadily for the past
30 years. I am of the
opinion that a big con-
tributor to this failure is
how environmentalism
has been linked most
strongly to individual
actions - a natural
conclusion within our
consumerist society.
Within this paradigm,
an environmentalist can
be one of two things:
(a) a hypocrite, or (b)
a purist, zero-waste,
vegan hippy who never
travels anywhere using
fossil fuels and may
well be regarded as
politically irrelevant. In
such a paradigm, you
can’t win!
Nobody is perfect,
not even world leaders,
celebrities or activists.
Instead of calling each
other out, we should
be working together to
build a better world. One
group who propagates
this philosophy is Ex-
tinction Rebellion (XR),
whose occupations of
central London grabbed
headlines across the
world in 2018 and 2019.
One of the fundamental
values of XR is that no
one person is responsi-
ble for climate change.
We all play a part in the
problem. The implica-
tion of this? We should
“Instead of
calling each
other out,
we should
be working
together to
build a better
world”
all play a part in the
solution.
There is little doubt
that 2019 was the year
where climate change
was forced into discus-
sion as an existential
threat to many species
and to many communi-
ties. Let’s make 2020 the
year where something
significant is finally
done about it. Reducing
the proportion of animal

one clear way of making
a contribution towards
this goal.
