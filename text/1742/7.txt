Unions? What are they good for?
The student Union must remember that it is first and foremost a body that represents the
interests of its members

T
he history of
trade unionism
in Britain is a
long and proud
one. Groups of workers,
recognising the strength
that their numbers and
know-how granted them
saw that while individ-
ually weak in the face
of huge organisations,
a withdrawal of labour
was a powerful enough
action to force changes in
procedure.
Student unionism has
a slightly less illustrious
history but it should never
be forgotten that student
led movements have long
been active and success-
ful, fighting the Citizen-
ship Amendment Bill in
India today or helping to
prevent implementation
of the regressive poll tax
in 1990’s Britain. The two
forms of unionism share
a common purpose of
representing the interests
of a group of individuals
lacking in wealth, time
and influence, to the
university, college or
company with which they
are affiliated.
It has been established
in these pages and by
multiple other sources
in the Union that the
rent model proposed by
the College is not in the
interests of the students
and that the models built
by the College priori-
tise profit over student
welfare. The model
suggests for example
that after 50 years of use
the value of the halls
buildings will be zero.
Odd as it is that a building
could change from being
suitable accommodation
for students one night and
then suddenly become
decrepit the next day, the
model increases payments
into a long term mainte-
nance fund by 80%. What
is the maintenance fund
being used for if not to
keep the halls in a good
condition? Obviously,
it is the Union’s job to
reject this rent model as
unfair and the fact that the
Council has done so three
times now is a point in
their favour.
This is not the end
of the story, however.
Having rejected the Col-
lege’s position the Union
should now lobby the
College as strongly as it
is able to reduce or even
prevent rent increases.
Atop the College’s egre-
gious definition of what
a ‘break even’ model is,
the assumption that the
College should be running
a ‘break even’ model, in
which the rent from the
halls is equal to their cost,
is an assumption that must
also be challenged. This is
the role of the Union.
Yet the only Union
response has been a spine-
less endorsement of a
hypothetical campaign to
be run by a non-Council
affiliated student. Their
reasoning for this was
that as Council meets
only every month any
campaign would be tor-
turously slow to react to
changes in events.
Therefore, it was felt to
be a better idea to allow a
student campaign to run
and provide support in
various activities such as
the production of posters
and leaflets, as it would
look better if the impetus
for the campaign came
from students as opposed
to the Council. For the
same reason the Council
discarded ideas such as
sit ins or demonstrations
as these would ideally
arise spontaneously from
amongst the student body.
In other words, second
year and above students
not in halls and first year
students without a lon-
gitudinal perspective on
hall prices are supposed
to mobilise themselves
spontaneously at which
point the Union would
step in and help them print
posters.
I find this attitude
particularly frustrating
given that the Union has
just created the position of
homogeneous halls closer
to campus will continue.
North Acton will become
a place to dump those that
can’t afford anywhere
closer in.
There is an obvious
route that the Union and
Council should take.
Members of the Council
should remember that
they are first and foremost
students who have been
elected to represent
students. They have been
given the responsibility
to pay attention to issues
such as rent increases so
that students don’t need
to. A Union led campaign
should be started with
rent strikes or helping
prospective student find
private accommodation
rather than enrich the
College as very possible
courses of action.
On the College side,
I would ask academics,
administrators and
anyone else with a voice
to remember their own
university days. I would
ask them to consider if
an institution as wealthy
as the College should be
employing underhand
tricks such as increasing
the value of the debt from
building the halls in line
with inflation - a loan is
for a fixed amount and
due to inflation the real
term value of that loan
will decrease over time.
The student body un-
derstands that rents will
inevitably increase. They
came to London knowing
how high the cost of living
is. The last thing they
expected, however, was
that the College would be
the one fleecing them.

Working Class liberation
officer in order to focus
more on issues of access
that affect students from
less well-off families.
There will be no spon-
taneous uprising. As a
result, prices will go up,
and the ongoing issue
of students from disad-
vantaged backgrounds
being shunted ever further
from South Kensington
while wealthy students
occupy ever more socially
“There
will be no
spontaneous
uprising”
Why then does our
Union Council shy away
from whole heartedly
backing the campaign to
oppose rent increases?
