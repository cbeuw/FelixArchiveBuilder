Sony Playstation 5 &
The Future of Con-
sole Gaming
S
ony teased its
Playstation 5
console last
month at CES
by unveiling its official
logo and announcing that
it was set for a holiday
2020 release; Microsoft’s
Xbox Series X is also set
to be launched in a similar
timeframe. However,
unlike Microsoft, Sony
didn’t reveal the actual
console. Rather, it’s
rumoured that Sony is set
to reveal it at a special
event later this month or
early next month. Since
the teaser, fans have been
speculating the price,
design, launch titles, and
specifications of the high-
ly-anticipated device.
It’s also rumoured
that Sony would wait for
Microsoft to launch the
Series X first and then
determine the price of the
PS5. Although, Microsoft
doesn’t seem too worried
about Sony or Nintendo;
in a recent interview,
Xbox head Phil Spencer
said that “Amazon and
Google are Xbox’s real
competition.” Microsoft
is trying to push Xbox
over to the cloud with
its Azure cloud infra-
structure through Project
xCloud. Thus, Microsoft
is, in essence, directly
competing with other
companies that have
world-class cloud infra-
structures and a focus on
gaming; these companies
include Google, Amazon,
and even Apple.
Sony and Nintendo,
on the other hand, are
more traditional com-
panies, focusing on
creating products rather
than shifting to services.
Coming back to the PS5,
it looks to have great
backwards compatibility
with the PS4 and highly
new galaxy foldable - the
Galaxy Z flip - have all
been leaked both through
Samsung themselves as
well as through other
sources. At this point,
it looks like the idea of
having an event about
the devices seems pretty
insignificant considering
that almost everything
has been leaked about
the devices, down to their
prices and even colours.
Anyways, the Z Flip is
set to be a direct compet-
itor to the Motorola Razr
and features a tall 6.7”
foldable display. From the
rumours and leaks, it looks
like Samsung has learned
from its experience with
the Galaxy Fold as the
new device promises to
be much more durable
and reliable in the long
run. Further, it is set to be
priced lower than the Fold
and higher than the S20
series. One disadvantage
with a foldable, though,
is that you’re paying for
the form factor rather than
for the specifications.
The Z flip would run
on the older Snapdragon
855+ processor, not have
a 5G variant, have a
battery capacity of 3300
mAh, and only possess a
mAh and 5000 mAh,
and feature rectangular
camera modules (similar
to those on the iPhone
11 series and the Pixel 4
series) with around 3 to
4 cameras. Furthermore,
these phones are rumoured
to have a buttery-smooth
120 Hz OLED displays
with an Infinity-O cutout.
The S20 line, in general,
would resemble the
the Note 10 series. The
Galaxy Unpacked event is
less than a week away, so
get ready for a rather fresh
dose of android flagships.
Oculus Quest Gains
Hand Tracking Fea-
ture
Late last year, Oculus’s
Quest VR headset
received a software update
that enables the device to
track its wearer’s hands.
This experimental feature
makes use of the onboard
cameras to track the
user’s hands for a more
natural, immersive, and
controller-free gaming ex-
perience. A recent update
makes the experience
much better for end-users;
however, there isn’t really
much to do with the hand
In an effort to encour-
age people to switch to
electric vehicles, the UK
government has planned
to ban the sale of gasoline
cars and hybrids by 2035,
five years earlier than
planned. Prime Minister
Boris Johnson said that
“There can be no greater
responsibility than
protecting our planet.”
This shows commitment
towards a positive change
that may influence other
countries and would cer-
tainly benefit our planet
environmentally. These
cars can still be sold on the
used market, but you can
expect heavy road taxes
and fuel charges. With
Norway, Netherlands,
France, and even India on
a similar track, it’s only a
matter of time before the
rest of the world follow
suit.

impressive performance
upgrades. The console’s
processor is based on
AMD’s Ryzen architec-
ture and its graphics would
be powered by a custom
AMD Navi GPU. Like the
Xbox Series X, the PS5
would ditch hard-drives
for solid-state-drives;
games would now launch
much faster and load
times would reduce sig-
nificantly. Furthermore,
the PS5 is confirmed to
be backwards compatible
with the PS4, meaning
that most of your old PS4
games would still run on
the PS5. In addition, most
of the games released
in the next year would
be cross-generational,
meaning that they would
still run on both genera-
tions of consoles.
Samsung Galaxy Z
Flip & S20 Series
Samsung seems to
have been facing a lot of
problems with containing
the excitement for it’s
next range of flagships.

aren’t any games on the

though it’s interesting
to see where Oculus and
game developers would
take this feature in the
future.
