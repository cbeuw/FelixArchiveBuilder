Oh Wonder - Ultralife: A Fantastic Outing
L
ondon-based duo
Oh Wonder,
J o s e p h i n e
VanderGuchtand
Anthony West released
their sophomore album
Ultralife in the summer
of 2017. The album re-
ception was bigger than
their debut album. While
they weren’t designed to
create bangers, the duo
proved that they have an
ear for instrumentation
& production tricks that
give them their signature
breathy synthpop sound
true versatility & maintain
the oh-so-delicate balance
between soft pop & in-
tricate indie. Their music
carries the feeling of a
controlled ray of sunshine.
‘Solo’, the first track
explores the chaos that
surrounds an individual
and the innate desire to
escape it. It starts with
sirens, these fade into a
lively beat. The dynamic,
blended vocals and
genuine lyrics make the
track a perfect start to a
joyful album.
“I’m breathing in, I’m
breathing out”
is a defining line,
coupled with heavy
chords, which leave you
wondering...
Then comes ‘Ultralife’,
a song that has you hooked
within the first 3 seconds.
The drum sample is bril-
liant, the chorus is catchy,
the electronic harmonies
accenting the chorus are
perfection and somehow
avoid sounding messy,
need I go on? It is be the
perfect soundtrack to fall
through a wormhole and
lose the concept of time
too, feeling surrounded
by a technicolour beat.
The pauses are perfect,
the lyrics are delicious,
especially the alliteration
“I’ve got so much soul
inside my bones,”
Go out and listen to this
stunning song.
The next tracks, ‘Life-
times’, ‘High on Humans’,
‘Lifetimes’ and ‘Heavy’
are bold choices, and
don’t adhere to the typical
verse-chorus format.
Instead, they hit you with
choruses throwing caution
to the wind, it’s quite risky
but the effort pays off and
each track sounds poppy,
edgy with plenty of catchy
melodies.
‘Bigger Than Love’
defines a relationship that
has the kind of love that is
powerful and moving but
also takes a dig at how a
love that strong carries its
poison.
“All my days are ready
to be hopeless at the start”,
Vander Gucht and
West sing on the bridge,
amusingly questioning

J
arrod Lawson, a
elctro-soul artist
has adopted the
moniker Orpheus
for his latest record
Visions. He speaks of
“shamanic” journeys as
the source of inspiration
for this record.
While the spacious,
funky instrumentals that
make up Visions are not
psychedelic enough to
evoke divine/drug in-
duced inspiration, each
track is undeniably
cool. Despite some bla-
tant D’angelo worship
on tracks like ‘Moon
Halos’ and ‘Gamma
Soirée’, Orpheus’ spa-
cious, synth heavy take
on neo-soul offers plen-
ty of nuance.
Harmonic and tex-
tural complexity can be
found at every turn, with
giddy synth runs and a
new instrument filling
every nook and cranny
of Visions. Referencing
electronic, latin (no-
tably on ‘Acension’)
and even minimalist
rhythms/sounds in it’s
satiny grooves, Orpheus
is very much operating
in a space beyond genre.
Visions comes on like
a peaceful evening, and
simultaneously relaxes
and engages the listener,
making it a worthwhile
listen for any soul, funk
or jazz fans.
Felix Recommends...
two tracks featuring
legendary vibraphonist
and icon of Ethio-jazz,
Mulatu Astake, as well
as associates of Brian
Eno and Carole King.
Thanks to the inter-
esting selection of col-
laborators each track has
its own energy. Tunes
range from instrumental
outings, typically with
a more raucous energy,
to engaging yet incredi-
bly introspective spoken
word outings like ‘Why
Yellow?’, which ex-
plores yellow as an em-
blem of human vigour,
“The light that surrounds
us is a poached egg on
a Saturday morning”.
With each track, how-
ever, the band brings the
same upbeat sensibility,
which ensures the listen-
er never bores.
The record is a fun lis-
ten, the band’s focus on
accessibility make this a
great starting point for
any looking to get famil-
iar with flavours of jazz,
Africa or the Caribbean.

The Archer
A
l e x a n d r a
S a v i o u r ,
signed to
C o l u m b i a
records at 18, is best
known for her associ-
ation with Alex Turner
(of the Arctic Monkeys).
Her second record: The
Archer, is a breath of
fresh air in the singer/
songwriter/indie scene.
While mournful lyrics
and spacious textures
place Alexandra along-
side contemporaries like
Julien Baker and Snail
Mail, her instrumentals
here possess an energy
of their own.
‘Saving Grace’, is a
great example of this,
with it’s smoky riffs, and
aching multi tracked vo-
cals, it creates a potent
atmosphere. The rest
of the LP errs strongly
toward the same dark
pole. Instrumental pal-
letes however, differ
significantly, with some
tracks built around na-
ked piano, others featur-
ing sparkling synth leads
over slithering grooves.
Saviour’s lyrics are
largely embellishments,
fitting well within the
thick, emotional ave-
nues of The Archer, but
not offering much to
chew over. Listen to this
if you want to be sad, or
already are.

MUSIC
this celebration of love
and implying that perhaps
once such a love has been
found, its sense of wonder
and excitement fades.
With beautiful strains and
instrumentation, this track
is a solid one that will
make you think.
‘Heart Strings’ has
a Lily Allen-esque pop
sound. However, the
chorus is a warmer and
more fun listen. ‘Slip
Away’ is a melancholic
song, with poignant lyrics
which make it feel like
the ending of “Marriage
Story”. ‘Overgrown’
and ‘My Friends’ have
an underlying theme of
asking for help & helping
someone out. They both
have gorgeous crescendos
throughout, slowly tran-
sitioning from a touch of
melancholy into hope and
promise. The piano instru-
mentation is impeccable.
The album ends with
‘Waste’ which is about
post-breakup loneliness.
Although the song has
powerful choruses, it lacks
the lyrics and melodies
found in previous tracks.
However, it does leave
you wanting more.
From a listener’s stand-
point, the enigmatic duo
from south-east London
has released a glorious
collection of romantic
ballads that help nurse you
through the brutal realities
of everyday life. If you
know someone who likes.
The Smiths, make them
listen to this wonder-ful
album!
