Ways to spaghett your pasta to the next level

P
asta ticks all the
boxes –– quick,
easy, cheap –– but
spaghetti with
jarred tomato sauce can
get boring, to say the
least, after the twentieth
time. So, how can you
elevate it without dishing
out an arm and a leg and
without honing in on your
busy work/study/procras-
tination schedule?
First things first: salt
your pasta water! I’m
sure all good chefs will
unanimously agree with
me on this one (I’m not
claiming to be one myself,
I just watch a lot of cheffy
food videos on YouTube
It adds a ton of flavour to
really elevate your final
dish. Liberal seasoning is
typically why restaurant
food tends to taste so
much better. Optimally,
the cooking water should
as salty as your ex. The
sea would do just fine
too. That might seem like
a heart attack-inducing
quantity, but you’re going
to be draining most of the
water, with most of the
salt, anyway. The salted
water does double duty:
you can also use it to
blanch vegetables (think
broccoli, frozen peas,
asparagus) for a couple
minutes before you toss it
“A sprinkling
of fresh or
dried herbs, or
even balsamic
vinegar, adds
depth of
flavour”
with sauce and pasta.
If you’re going to be
dressing your pasta (I sure
hope you do) later, cook
your pasta until its al dente
(Italian for ‘to the tooth’;
aka with a firm bite). Pasta
continues to cook as you
stir it into warmed sauce
or if you decide to toss it
in a saucepan with some-
thing else. This way, you
don’t end up with mushy
pasta. The timing should
be on the packaging, but
if you’re unsure, don’t go
about throwing a strand
of spaghetti to a wall and
seeing if it sticks. Taste
it! Go for something a bit
firmer than you’d like, or
bite and look at the centre.
If there’s a small, whitish,
dry core, it’s al dente! If
you like your pasta super
firm, cook it a minute orzo
less than what it would
take to reach al dente.
After cooking your
pasta (and maybe veg-
etables), reserve some
cooking water before
draining. It contains starch
released by the pasta in
the cooking process which
does wonders for emulsi-
fying any sauce you add
in later. Another thing:
don’t rinse your pasta!
This only prevents sauce
from clinging onto any
remainder starch on your
pasta to coat it evenly. We
don’t want sauce to be
sliding all over the place.
Now that we have beau-
tifully cooked pasta, it’s
time for sauce. To spice
things up (literally), add
a pinch of paprika, chilli
powder, red pepper flakes
or ground black pepper
when you’re reheating
that jarred tomato sauce.
A sprinkling of fresh or
dried herbs, like basil,
oregano and rosemary, or
even a drizzle of balsamic
vinegar,canalsoadddepth
of flavour that’ll only cost
you a mere penne more.
If you’re feeling fancy,
opt for fresh herbs for an
extra punch.
If you have a little extra
time, feel free to elevate
the tomato sauce with
extra ingredients. Heat
oil in a saucepan and
fry some garlic (minced,
thinly slice or smashed
–– it’s down to how lazy
you feel) until fragrant.
To up the nutritional value
and taste, add in diced or
thinly sliced vegetables
(perhaps blanched in the
salted water beforehand),
mushrooms, ground meat
and/or chopped bacon or
sausage and cook until
nicely browned before
adding in the sauce and
perhaps herbs and spices.
What you add depends on
how much time you want
to dedicate to chopping
and what you have at
hand. All this sauteeing
might seem like a hassle,
but it can be done while
your pasta is boiling away.
Don’t just limit yourself
to tomato sauce though.
There is a huge spectrum
of prepared sauces
available on supermarket
shelves, such as various
pestos and cream-based
sauces, including plenty
of plant-based options for
my vegan friends. Add
some to the same pan with
the extra veg and/or meat
to reheat, then on goes
the drained pasta. Here’s
where that reserved pasta
water comes in. Treat it
like a strong alcoholic
drink. Without, the pasta
and sauce might mingle,
exchange small talk, but
a little splash of starchy
water will really get the
sparks flying At this point
you may want to add in
some cheese – grated
parmesan is always
reliable, but try ricotta or
feta to enhance the cream-
iness. Don’t worry if it all
looks a little watery – the
sauce will eventually
thicken to give your pasta
a gorgeous glossy coat.
If you’re feeling healthy,
stir in some tender greens
until wilted –– spinach,
rocket, fresh basil or
parsley are good options.
Or, ditch the jarred stuff
altogether and come up
with your own sauce in the
same time. It might even
come out cheaper than if
you were to buy premade
sauce. Heat up some oil
and/or butter, then add in
garlic until fragrant. And
then sautée whatever you
like as described above
before adding in your
pasta and pasta water. Try
olives or capers for an
umami boost, or lemon
juice/zest for brightness,
or heavy cream for cream-
iness, or mix and match
different cheeses to see
which combinations you
like. There are endless
pastabilities.
Since you’ve already
gone the extra mile
(without spending too
much extra time), why not
add toppings? More grated
cheese is always nice, but
chopped nuts, toasted
seeds and breadcrumbs
provide a nice contrasting
crunch while fresh tender
herbs or greens lightens
up a rich, creamy dish. If
you’re feeling adventur-
ous, yoghurt can provide a
bit of welcome tanginess.
One more thing: switch
up the pasta shapes!
There’s a reason over 600
different shapes exist: they
are optimised for certain
sauces. Rule of thumb:
wide noodles = thick,
heavy, chunky sauce.
Thin noodles = creamy,
light, smooth sauce.
Ridges and hollows, as
in penne or rigatoni, are
ideal for trapping hearty
sauces and pestos. Shorter
pieces, like fusilli and
farfalle, are great for pasta
salads (which also take
minimal time and money)
You might find you prefer
the texture and sauce-re-
taining ability of other
shapes over what you are
normally having now.
On hectic days, you
probably want to go for
something even quicker.
Instead of microwaved
ready-meals, opt for
one-pot pastas – they
are superior in cost and
flavour, with a multitude
of online recipes. All you
do is chuck the ingredi-
ents (yes, including raw
pasta) into a pot, cover
and simmer. In under
20 minutes, you end up
with a tasty and filling
meal, minus the hassle
of draining pasta, reheat-
ing sauce and washing
multiple pans. Plus, you
can always make extra
portions to to cut down
on cooking time on
upcoming busy days.
Hopefully by now
you’ve gathered some
inspiration for your next
meals, or at least some
vague idea in the back of
your mind. No need to
follow all these tips reli-
giously; simply adopting
a couple can step up your
pasta game. Since you’re
likely going to be eating
pasta for the next few
years at uni (and probably
beyond that as well), you
might as well experiment
and keep things saucy in
the kitchen.

while chewing food.
Since it might be the case
that someone asks you a
question while you have
just put the next bite into
your mouth, signal to
the asker that you will
finish chewing before you
answer.
Once you have finished
with a course, you should
put your fork and knife at
a twenty past four clock
angle to signal that you
are done. You must not
put the used silverware
on the table; simply leave
it on the plate, so that it
can be taken away. After
the meal, you can then
rest your elbows on the
table, as long as your body
language shows you are
interested in the ongoing
conversation.
You should actively
participate in the conver-
“Once you
have finished
with a course,
put your fork
and knife at a
twenty-past-
four clock
angle”
sation, but neither be the
most silent person, nor the
only one talking. Further-
more, you should avoid
talking about politics,
religion, and sexuality,
since these topics are
very inappropriate for the
lunch or dinner table.
Finally, be aware of
cultural differences. Some
things you are used to,
may appear to be rude in
other countries.
You are now prepared
to impress your future
boss and everybody else
at the table. The best
would be to practice the
above mentioned so that
you know all the relevant
information by heart, but
you have just learned the
basics of etiquette! Con-
gratulations! Every uni’s student best friend // Wikimedia
