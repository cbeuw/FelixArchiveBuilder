Popcity UK Vol. 5
I
must be completely
honest here and say
I had never been
to a Hip-hop event
before, so the prospect
of having to review one
seemed daunting at best.
However, after four
hours submerged into the
swirling madness that is
this dance world the only
word that comes to mind
is: WOW. Now in its ﬁfth
year, the international
dance competition housed
in the ﬂagship venue
that is Shoreditch Town
Hall, brings together an
array of international
and UK-based artists of
all ages in the Hip-hop
and Popping world. The
mood in the main room,
however, wasn’t one of
ﬁerce competitiveness but
one of brotherhood, with
dancers from different
backgrounds coming
together to support each
other and share knowl-
edge. The brainchild of
Dickson Mbi, Brooke
Milliner and Shawn
Aimey from the prestig-
ious UK Popping Crew
Fiya House; PopCity UK
is, in their own words “led
by Hip Hop artists for
Hip Hop artists, with the
community at its core.”
The love is apparent
in the room as soon as
you enter it, people are so
welcoming, and they draw
you into their culture.
This is Popcity. The music
was banger after banger
featuring the likes of DJ
T-sia and DJ Fayme, they
judged the crowd expertly
with excellent technical
mixes. Internationally
acclaimed judges were
present from as far as
South Korea. Seeing them
in action was something
else, they had total
mastery of their body,
contorting and twisting
in a mesmerising display
of expression. Dancers
compete an impressive
feat considering the £100
cash prize for the winners
of each category and the
chance to represent the
UK at the PopCity ﬁnals
in East Asia.
