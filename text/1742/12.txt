Carmen: Tale of a Femme Fatale
I
f you have always
wanted to see an
opera but never had
the chance, Carmen
might be a very good
place to start. One of the
most popular operas of
all times, its music has
appeared countless times
outside of the opera world,
including in cartoons and
adverts, so you are sure to
hear some familiar tunes.
This particular produc-
tion does great justice
to Bizet’s masterpiece,
featuring eye-catching
ensemble scenes, captivat-
ing complex characters,
and spotless singing all
the way through. As a
self-proclaimed “national
opera company for all”,
English National Opera
(ENO) translates all their
productions into English,
which, albeit unfaithful
to the original work, im-
proves engagement with
the words and the story
being told.
Carmen is a femme-fa-
tale who is deeply aware
of her seduction powers,
enjoys using them
profusely and entrances
every single man on stage.
Justina Gringyté lives up
to the role, dominating
the stage at all times with
her fiery acting and clear
mezzo-soprano register.
If a fault must be found,
she is a touch too blonde
for a gypsy girl. She falls
in love with Don José,
a passionate yet jealous
army corporal, but later
leaves him for Escamillo,
a famous bullfighter with
a big ego. The libretto
explores the conflicts that
arise, painting a complex
picture of human relation-
ships. All main characters
are morally compromised
in some ways and mis-
treated in others, but
that is what makes them
interesting and ultimately
relatable.
This is overall a very
enjoyable production,
with impressive sets and
unexpected moments.
One scene in particular
made me admire the cast’s
ability to sing and be
quite physical at the same
time, though my favourite
moment has to be the
famous aria “L’amour est
un oiseau rebelle”, mostly
because my high expecta-
tions were fulfilled. There
were only a couple of less
fortunate moments. On
one, a premature attempt
at comic relief was simply
weird. Then, the stomping
of army boots muffled
the singing of the ladies’
chorus. But perhaps that
was intentional, showing
how teasing woman for
fun is simply annoying
and not fun at all.
Bizet’s genius or-
chestration, capturing
intense Spanish rhythms,
together with clever
artistic choices, expand
and amplify emotions.
We leave lost, having
been fully immersed in a
world of soldiers on duty,
children playing on the
streets, factory woman
enjoying cigarettes,
toreros and their legions
of fans, and smuggling
travellers - then suddenly
brought back.
A Female Faustus: an ambitious twist on a classic
A
ward-winning
p l a y w r i g h t
Chris Bush’s
radical retelling
of the German legends of
Faust, whose pact with the
devil gives his unlimited
knowledge and worldly
pleasures – but as always,
there is a price to pay. This
myth exploring sacrifices,
legacy, hubris, and greed
has previously been the
basis for many literary
works (most notably
Christopher Marlowe’s
Doctor Faustus, and
Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe’s Faust), but none
have reinterpreted it in
this way – an inversion
of gender where the
iconic character of Johann
becomes Johanna. This
allows countless new
themes to be explored,
which are perhaps more
relevant than those relat-
ing to an accomplished but
bored man who squanders
the powers he is granted
playing practical jokes.
In this play, Faustus is
reimagined as a young
17th century woman,
the daughter of a plague
doctor father and a mother
who was tried and killed
as a witch years ago.
Here, it feels like she has
more of a reason to strike
a deal with Lucifer – more
agency and the ability
to control her destiny.
Her sex and social class
changes the lens of the
play, and what she chooses
to do with her newfound
abilities. Consequently,
this play becomes an
intriguing study on the
female experience, and
what a woman does with
greatness. Bush has taken
a classic male narrative
and inserted a woman into
it – this creates more ob-
stacles and new directions
for the story to take.
The beginning is
confusing as the Faustus’
backstory is so different
from the original, but by
the end of the first half I
was thoroughly enjoying
the play - the plot began
to make sense, there were
interesting twists, and the
characters were well-de-
veloped. Faustus struck
a deal for 144 years of
life with unlimited power
from Lucifer’s servant
Mephistopheles and the
ability to leap forwards in
time. However, perhaps
all these new ideas were
too ambitious, as the
second half feels muddled
as she traverses further in
time particularly as she
enters the modern age. I
feel the message is lost,
and the aim of exploring
women in history who
have broken the social
constraints of a male-dom-
inated world is not met
as expertly as in the first
half. More exposition was
needed, and though the
play was 2 hours long, the
half following the interval
felt rushed.
However, I can
overlook all this as Jodie
McNee plays a brilliant
Faustus, saving the
second half from falling
flat. Furthermore, I have
to commend the striking
set design of Ana Inés
Jabares-Pita and the
lighting designer Richard
Howell, who aptly reflect
the tone of the play in the
environment – first dark
and cavernous, fluidly
changing to reflect the
location and time period
all the way in to the 21st
century.
