T
he Leadership
Elections, at
which 737
Union roles are
elected, have opened
for nominations. The
positions include senior
Union roles such as
the sabbatical officers
(Union President, Deputy
President, and ICSMSU
President), Constituent
Union Presidents,
the Liberation and
Community Officers, and
academic and wellbeing
student representatives.
Any student may stand
for election, though final
year students can only
stand for full-time sabbat-
ical roles.
The nominations
opened on Monday 3rd
February and will run until
Friday 28th, followed by
campaigning from the
4th of March and voting
between 9th and 12th
March. The results are
expected to be announced
in Metric on the 13th, at
the Results Party.
Imperial has consist-
ently had some of the
highest election turnouts
in the country, hitting
41% last year. It has also
had particularly fierce
competition for certain
roles in recent years, with
more students standing
and competing for roles.
The week prior to the
votes opening, the ‘Meet
the Candidates’ debate
will take place, where
nominees for the most
senior positions will
debate questions posed
by Felix Deputy Editor
Charlie Titmuss. The
show will be streamed
live on the ICU Facebook
page and will be produced
by ICTV and IC Radio.
The Head of Student
Voice, Keriann Lee, said:
“LE20 is the biggest
democratic exercise at
Imperial in which all
students choose full time
sabbatical officers and
senior volunteers for
academic year 2020-21.
“The elections have
improved dramatically in
the past two years through
a systematic management
process and this has
resulted in a smoother
experience for students
with increasingly higher
nominations and voter
participation. This year's
nomination period will
include talks about the
major positions so that
students have even more
information about the
responsibilities and com-
mitment involved before
standing. It's felt that the
talks, held every Wednes-
day during February at
the Union, should allow
for even more realistic
manifestos and informed
campaigning.
“Over the past four
cycles, more time has
been spent during the
nominations process
ensuring that students
understand the roles, why
they are important, and
what the commitment is.
This, coupled with greater
multi-campus promotions
and better segmented
communications, has led
to a stronger field of can-
didates, better campaigns,
and ultimately higher
turnout.
“An additional step
has been inserted into
the elections timetable
to make the complaints
process even smoother. In
addition to the complaints
deadline, students will
now have the chance to
indicate their intention to
submit a complaint right
after polls close so that
there are fewer surprises
on results day and the
team can administer the
process more efficiently.”
“Imperial has
consitently
had some of
the highest
election
turnouts in
the country,
hitting 41%
last year”
THE Names Imperial Sixth Most International Uni

T
imes Higher
Education has
ranked Imperial
College London
as the 6th most interna-
tional university in the
world, and 1st most inter-
national in the UK.
The top two spots in
the global ranking are
taken by two universities
in Hong Kong, the City
University of Hong Kong
and University of Hong
Kong respectively.
University of Oxford
takes joint 7th in the
global ranking, along with
the National University of
Singapore; whereas Uni-
versity of Cambridge is
next at 9th. Other top UK
universities are ranked as
follows: King’s College
London at 11th, Univer-
sity College London at
12th, and London School
of Economics and Politi-
cal Science at 15th.
The ranking is calculat-
ed by weighting several
factors: the proportion
of international students,
the proportion of interna-
tional staff, the number
of journal publications
with one or more interna-
tional co-author, and the
international reputation
of the university. These
four factors are weighted
equally. International
reputation is measured by
Times Higher Education
by inviting scholars to
rank the world’s best
universities for their field,
and looking at the pro-
portion of overseas votes
received for a university.
In 2017-18, 64% of
newly admitted students
(both undergraduate and
postgraduate) were from
outside the UK. Of this,
17% were from China,
by far the largest non-UK
nationality, followed by
5% from France, 3% from
Spain, Germany, Italy,
and Greece each, and 2%
from Malaysia, India, Sin-
gapore, and Hong Kong
each. Students from other
nationalities make up
23% of the international
student population.
At Imperial, students
come from over 130 coun-
tries around the world.
