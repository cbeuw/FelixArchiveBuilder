A closer look: Trade Deficits and Surpluses
imports?
In the context of in-
ternational trade, export
refers to any goods or
services produced within
the jurisdiction of a
country that is sold outside
the country. And imports
are any goods or services
produced outside the
jurisdiction of the country
that is purchased in the
country. For example, if
Italy produces apples and
sells them to the UK. This
would be an example of
Italy exporting apples to
the UK and the UK im-
porting apples from Italy.
What is a surplus?
A surplus refers to the
notion that the monetary
value of the imports of
a country is greater than
its exports. Taking the
previous example of
the UK and Italy, where
Italy exports apples to
the UK. Let’s say the UK
uses the imported apples
to make apple cider and
sell it to Italy. We can
logically assume that the
cost of the cider is more
expensive than the apple.
Therefore, if the UK uses
all the apples it imports to
Does this mean a trade
surplus is always good?
In general, it is fair to
say that a trade surplus
is good. However, there
might be situations where
acountry,companiesorin-
dividuals might choose to
run a deficit. For example,
a country could choose
to run a trade deficit if it
decides to spend millions
of pounds importing
energy due to unforeseen
energy consumption, to
provide for its citizens.
An interesting effect of
a trade surplus
The effects of a trade
surplus might result in a
trade deficit. How does
this happen? Let’s take
the cider example. The
UK sells cider to Italy and
Italy sell apples to the UK.
Earlier we said that the UK
has a trade surplus but we
did not take into account
the effect of currencies.
This surplus might
increase the value of the
pound against the euro
because the UK sells its
goods in pounds and for
Italy to purchase ciders it
would need to buy pounds.
As a result, the demand
A country could be in surplus and deficit to different countries at the same time! // Carroll D.Wright, 1899
Trade deals are agree-
ments between two or
more countries, usually
in the form of a treaty,
underlying how they can
trade with each other.
This, however, does not
take into account the
World Trade Organisation
(WTO) trade rules, which
allows member countries
to trade with each other on
predefined rules, without
a trade deal.
The lack of a trade deal
provides less favourable
trading terms for the
countries involved. For
example, taxes imposed
on goods by another
country which result in
more expensive goods
and thus reducing the
overall demand for those
same goods.
L
et’s begin with
some definitions.
What is Trade?
It is the concept
of buying and selling of
goods and services with
compensation provided to
the seller by the buyer. A
more direct explanation
would be the exchange
of goods and services
between parties.

a trade surplus
might result in
a trade deficit.
How does this
happen?...”

Why is trade important
and how is it relevant
to me?
At the fundamental
level trade occurs daily,
For example when you
purchased that cup of
coffee. You were provided
with a service from the
interaction and the goods
is coffee. In return, you
handover cash which
was the compensation
you owe for the goods
and service. Trade, in this
aspect, is vastly important
because it allows indi-
viduals to leverage each
other, instead of having to
produce all of the goods
and services that she or
he consumes. At a global
level, we can talk about
the trade between coun-
tries using terms such as
Deficits and Surpluses,
but before that, we need
to introduce the notion of
exports and imports.

make cider and sell all the
cider it produces to Italy.
The monetary value of
the goods sold by the UK
would be greater than that
of Italy. Hence the UK
would have what is called
a trade surplus. And Italy
would have what we call a
trade deficit.
What is a deficit?
A deficit refers to the
notion that the monetary
value of the exports of a
country is greater than its
imports. In layman terms,
we can oversimplify this
concept and say that the
country behaves like a
friend who spends more
money than she/he has.
for pounds goes up,
relative to the euro. And
more pounds would
flow into the UK, giving
it better control of its
currency. This, in turn,
makes ciders seem more
expensive to Italy due to
the cost of pounds and
results in Italy importing
fewer ciders from the UK.
Since the UK sells fewer
ciders, its imports are
“Surplus - the
notion that
the monetary
value of the
imports of
a country is
greater than
its exports”
“Agreements
between
two or more
countries,
usually in
the form of a
treaty”
worth more than its export
and it experiences a trade
deficit.
Trade deals
The discussion on trade
would not be complete
without talking about
trade deals. What are
they?
