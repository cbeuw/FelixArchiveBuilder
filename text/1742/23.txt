ooks must be the
most guessable
of gifts. There
may be a fleet-
ing moment where the
square, snugly wrapped
present could still be a
box of chocolates, but
that thought is quickly
discarded on picking it
up – even the priciest
choccies are no match for
a book in weight.
I received one such
gift this Christmas,
excitement dimming the
moment I sussed out
what it was. But I was too
hasty in my judgement,
as this book – Women
in Science: 50 Fearless
Pioneers who Changed
the World, by Rachel
Ignotofsky – turned out to
be a delightful eye opener.
Published in 2017, it
was bang-on trend with
the meteoric prominence
given to women, in virtu-
ally any sphere of life. By
now, moving into 2020,
you could be forgiven for
an eyeroll at a bandwag-
on-jumping title – yes,
yes, we all know science
is for women too (and if
you don’t, where have you
been hiding?!). I’ll admit
to being a tad sceptical
myself.
So yes, the title may be
a bit of an obvious hook.
However, once I actually
settled down to read it,
the real selling point was
still there, hidden in that
title – fearless pioneers.
Irrespective of their
gender, the individuals
Ignotofsky profiles in her
book are the forgotten
geniuses, overlooked by
history – and yes, in some
instances buried behind
a more prominent male
scientist, but it is their
achievements, not just
their gender, that burns off
the page.
How could it be that I
hadn’t heard of Hertha
Ayrton, whose success
improving electrical street
lights used in Victorian
Britain forced the Royal
Society to let her, a
woman, present a paper
there? Or the American
geneticist, Nettie Stevens,
who discovered sex
was determined by our
chromosomes? What
about Chien-Shiung Wu,
who disproved the law
of conservation of parity
concerning radioactive
atoms?
Each of these profiles is
accompanied by a page-
wide stylised drawing
of the woman under the
spotlight, busy with some
sort of scientific activity.
Ignotofsky both authors
and illustrates the book.
The era-appropriate
outfits are a nice touch,
showing off the diversity
of these individuals from
women in Greek togas
to Renaissance period
clothing, modern-day
suits, astronaut gear, and,
of course, white lab-coats.
It makes a clear statement
that women have been ad-
vancing science for over a
millennium, and yet were
consistently written out of
popular history.
Quotes, diagrams,
and factoid captions are
sprinkled liberally across
the pages, crowding the
margins, making for a
teenage-girl-diary feel that
probably reflects the target
audience of the book. The
additional information
clustered there definitely
piques interest, whatever
the design intent.
The short one-page
profiles make for sporadic
reading, and given this
amount of novel infor-
mation crammed into
each one, it’s probably
best to limit reads to a
few women a day for
maximum assimilation.
But far be it from me to
put limits on you!
I shall, however, rec-
ommend a read.

Forgotten scientists: Battle for the sexes – Nettie

ettie Stevens
is not a house-
hold name,
yet her dis-
covery of how sex is
determined is common
household knowledge.
Born in Vermont in 1861,
Nettie graduated at 19 to
become a teacher before
further pursuing her stud-
ies and enrolling at Bryn
Mawr College in her late
30’s.
Thanks to Nettie’s
work, we now know that
the 23rd
pair of chromo-
somes in humans varies
between male and female
as XY or XX, respec-
tively. Nettie Stevens’
major paper in the field
of cytology, the study
of cells, was written in
1904 with the 1933 Nobel
Prize winner, Thomas
Hunt Morgan, a geneticist
and zoologist. At the
time, science was unsure
of what determined an
animal’s sex at birth,
humans included. Was it
down to temperature, as
with some reptiles such
as crocodiles? Could it
be the diet of the parents?
She was involved in
discovering that sex is
determined by the X and
Y sex chromosomes, and
that in humans, the sperm
determines the sex of the
foetus.
Chromosomes were
named because of how
they absorb dye when
stained, after the Greek
chromo for colour. Inter-
estingly, the X chromo-
some was named not so
much from its shape but
from its unknown function
at the time, described
by Nettie’s previous
advisor, Edmund Miller.
The second copy of the
X chromosome provides
a back-up for X chromo-
some genes, explaining
why certain conditions,
such as colour-blindness,
occur more in XY indi-
viduals who lack a second
copy.
The immune system
in those of us with XX is
actually primed to respond
to the foreign Y chromo-
some, making fertilisation
an incredibly complex
process with all the odds
stackedagainstitssuccess.
Additionally, the foetus
is only driven towards
an XY phenotype upon
activation of the sex-de-
termining region (SRY)
gene, making gender a
naturally complex journey
to rival the story of the
mechanism’s discovery
by Nettie.
Nettie cracked the code
of a scientific mystery
which had puzzled
researchers for years.
Never heard of Nettie Stevens? That’s precisely the point, as Science writer Lydia Melville profiles this scientist

However, as she died in
1912 from breast cancer,
she was not recognised
for her work for a long
time after her death. Other
similar cases of missed
recognition of scientists’
ground-breaking research
include, most famously,
Rosalind Franklin for her
contribution in the discov-
ery of the double helical
structure of DNA. Some-
times, it may still feel as
though scientists work
this way, worlds apart
from equality, despite
such a small genetic dif-
ference between the male
and female sexes.
