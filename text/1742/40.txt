Imperial Sailing take on the Turtle

T
he University
of Warwick’s
annual sailing
event is famous
both for bringing togeth-
er teams from all over
the UK for a fantastic
weekend’s racing, and
notorious for the excellent
social the hosts put on.
With the aforemen-
tioned in mind, Imperial
College Sailing Club sent
a huge 5 teams (over 30
sailors) up to Leamington
Spa to experience the
very best of what the
Midlands had to offer.
Arriving late on Friday,
Commodore Ariane de
Saint Victor led her salty
crew to Neon, the club al-
located for the first night’s
party. Following some
wily queue-jumping, the
weekend was kicked off
the way any good sailing
event should be: with a
good old boogie. One
notable performance was
from Greg Reich, who
was removed from the
dance floor and premises
for crowd surfing (like
the club mascot he is to
all of us!) but somehow
enough wind to sail in the
mid-morning. However,
as the day progressed,
the breeze filled in, and
eventually all 5 teams
got racing. For Imperial,
it was an event for the
underdogs; the 2nds
(Imperial White) and the
4ths (Imperial Python
Tornado) stole the show,
punching well above their
weight and outmanoeu-
vring many more revered
and experienced teams,
including, in the case of
the 2nds, our own first
team (Imperial Blue)!
Following this long
and tiring day everyone
headed home to nap,
before preparing their
best fancy dress for the
evening’s entertainment:
a curry before a sample of
the best (worst) of what
Leamington Spa has to
offer on a Saturday night.
Despite an urban popula-
tion of almost 100 000, the
town managed to provide
barely a single partygoer
to either Kelsey’s Bar
or the club Assembly.
However, never ones to
let circumstance ruin an
evening, especially with
such a strong contingent
in tow, Imperial simply
brought the good time
with them: singlehand-
edly transforming both
venues from quiet bars
and empty dancefloors to
the unquestionable plac-
es-to-be that night. Tables
were danced on, barmaids
were wooed, security was
evaded (if only Anahita
had passed on her stealthy
skills to the Firsts - they
might have avoided some
of the numerous penalties
they picked up during the
course of the racing!) and
friendships were formed
with sailors from across
the UK, as far North as
Durham; as far South as
Plymouth.
Nursing hangovers the
next morning, the sailors
headed back to Draycote
to continue the compe-
tition. The breeze was
much stronger, allowing
some of the heavier boats
to shine. Despite some
more close racing, no
Imperial teams qualified
for the semi-final stages,
but regardless the lessons
learnt over the course of
the event would prove
invaluable going forward
into the national Qualifier
event next weekend in
Oxford.
only sailed 8 races across
the two days, which was
a bit disappointing. A
further half sailing boat
(the leeward side) has
been deducted for the ri-
diculous line bias on many
of the first day’s races, but
as we are rounding up
that’s OK.
Many thanks to
Warwick University for
once again organising a
great event – it has been
the source of sailing
gossip for the past two
weeks now! Also thank
you to Rooster Sailing
for providing us with
our amazing sailing kit,
without which we would
have frozen. And last but
definitely not least, a ma-
hoo-ssive thank you to
our drivers Toby, Harry,
Daniel and Nik – the
latter of whom we have
managed to steal from
Gliding and American
Football!
