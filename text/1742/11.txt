Tarkovsky,
and how
can I slip
the phrase into a conver-
sation? Under an inter-
rogation scenario, you
would probably guess that
it’s an “extended poetic
exploration” written by
a Dutch collective called
something like Metahav-
en, and that you could
never reasonably use
the phrase in a sentence
without spending a further
ﬁve minutes trying to
explain a term you’re not
even sure if you really un-
derstand. And you would
be correct. But unlike
most extended poetic ex-
plorations, I think that this
one has a more prescient
message hidden amongst
the techno-political pro-
tologisms and Flaubert
quotations.
The premise of the
book is to question how
we live and interact
with digital technology
through the lens of
cinema. Speciﬁcally, the
lens of Andrei Tarkovsky.
The book recognises
the contrast of trying to
compare our ﬁber optic,
attention redundant lives
to a Russian ﬁlm director
famed for slow shots of
almost still images and
who “detested computers
before they were omni-
present,” but stick with
it. The connection lies
in the smartphone, the
“yet-undeclared cinema
of the interface,” the
technology that allows
anybody to produce,
share and view ﬁlms on
demand. We are increas-
ingly being immersed in
this cinema, the average
US adult spends two
hours and 51 minutes on
their smartphone every
day, eight minutes longer
than Tarkovsky’s ﬁlm
Stalker. The book tries to
deﬁne a new phenomenon
of Digital Tarkovsky: “a
cinematic discrepancy
between speed of platform
and lived experience
under all-encompassing
computational force,” or
how digital services like
Instagram aim to make
life seem to move faster
using techniques similar
to Tarkovsky, controlling
the pace and pressure of
time to create immersive
cinema.
The effects of this
phenomenon range from
mobile phone journalism
to machine vision and
dash cam crash montages.
The book explores these
tangents alongside plots
from Tarkovsky’s ﬁlms
and, to meet the brief of a
poetic exploration, inter-
sperses “cut to” sections
varying from short scenes
of everyday life to tales
of St Francis of Assisi.
Speciﬁc focus is paid to
how, like in Tarkovsky’s
ﬁlms, the technique of
pacing is used to create a
suspension of disbelief.
It’s not hard to see this
willful belief in ﬁction
everywhere online from
social media inﬂuencers
to twitter bots spreading
fake news. This is pre-
sented as a byproduct of
technology overcoming
the uncanny valley as
well as almost univer-
sal access to cameras
making everyday scenes
more cinematic whilst
destroying faith in images
being truthful. In the age
of Digital Tarkovsky
we take the “spectre of
techno-political force” as
something inescapable
and ambient. Importantly,
the book touches on the
psychological effects on
the viewer like FOMO
and a feeling of isolation
when using services like
Instagram where stories
and are stitched together
with the “post-continuity”
of a Michael Bay movie.
Metahaven ultimately
ask us to question who
How can we view the tiny screens on our smartphones through Tarkovsky’s cinematic lens? Digital Tarkovsky is a
poetic exploration of how our experience of visual entertainment has evolved over time.

“The
connection
lies in the
smartphone,
yet-undeclared
cinema of the
interface”
or what is directing this
new cinema, and if they
should have control over
our reality.
So to answer the
initial questions, Digital
Tarkovsky is relevant,
worrying and only going
to become a bigger part of
reality, and you could use
it in sentences like “Wow
that’s so Digital Tark-
ovsky,” or “Ah, that’s due
to the Digital Tarkovsky!”
or maybe “You should
read Digital Tarkovsky.”
“Digital
Tarkovsky is
only going
to become a
bigger part of
reality”
