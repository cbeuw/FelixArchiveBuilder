T
his week Felix
attended the Q
& A and raffle
with Jacob
Rees-Mogg on Tuesday
the 4th of February, or-
ganised by the Conserv-
ative Society of Imperial
College London. The
event attracted over 200
students, filling up the
rows of CAGB 200 in a
manner not usually seen
at a lecture theatre for
Mechanical Engineering
students. Though most
attendees were Imperial
students, there were
some Imperial staff and
external visitors present
as well. The event ended
with a group photo-op of
the audience members
with Rees-Mogg.
Prior to Rees-Mogg's
arrival, Felix had the
chance to interview some
members of the audience.
We asked attendees what
party they voted for in the
last election, how active
they were politically,
their thoughts on Re-
es-Mogg, and their view
of STEM-centric Imperial
as a space for political dis-
cussion. The responses we
received are by no means
comprehensive, but they
are nonetheless inform-
ative. Unsurprisingly,
majority of interviewees
voted Conservative in the
last election, though many
did not vote for Johnson
in the leadership election.
Most interviewees were
politically active to some
extent, either as a member
of a political Party, or at
least engaged enough to
vote in leadership elec-
tions and keep up with
current political affairs.
Responses tell us that
people do not think of
Imperial as a particularly
political environment,
though they also say this
doesn’t mean Imperial
people are politically
abstinent, rather just
politically active behind
closed doors. Some also
mentioned that Imperial,
not unlike other universi-
ties, may seem more toler-
ant of left-wing opinions
than right-wing ones; but
others say Imperial is ac-
tually quite civil. Overall,
there seems to be demand
for more political events
at Imperial to engage stu-
dents with more of these
discussions.
The members of the
audience were fairly en-
amoured by Rees-Mogg.
Kane, a Brexit party voter
appreciated Rees-Mogg
for his honesty, whilst
Tom, a Conservative voter
and party member, liked
him for his policies and
found him entertaining
of him and were hoping to
find out by attending.
Once Rees-Mogg
arrived, he provided a
brief 10-minute speech
summarising his views.
For the remainder of
the session, Rees-Mogg
answered questions from
audience members, about
his politics and his poli-
cies.
Felix asked Rees-Mogg
for his opinion on the
creation of a new Liber-
ation Officer position, a
Working-Class Liberation
Officer, by Imperial
College Union. He stated
that he did not believe
people from different
backgrounds should be
treated differently or
given special treatment,
but he respected that Im-
perial College Union, as
a Democratic institution,
was entitled to do as it
desired.
Rees-Mogg fielded
many other questions
on the dangers of being
a young Conservative
at university, a potential
union between Canada,
Australia New Zealand
and the UK, liberalising
drug laws, and propor-
tional representation.
On the matter of HS2
Rees-Mogg plead the fifth
and refused to comment
on the ongoing renewal of
the massively costly infra-
structure project. A clear
highlight for the audience
was the memorable quote
on the subject of his
activity on social media,
“Twitter was really quite
fun, as you can really
wind up the Left!”, which
led to much laughter and
applause.
Following the Q &
A, Rees-Mogg drew the
winning raffle tickets,
with an amusing selection
of prizes. Amongst others,
Rees-Mogg presented a
copy of the Communist
Manifesto, European and
Union flags, and of course
an obligatory bottle of
wine.
Overall, the Chair of
Imperial College Con-
servative Society, Marwan
Riach stated that the event
went “very well, with
good turnout.” He was
also pleased about the lack
of disruption to the event
offered by other left-wing
societies such as Imperial
Left Forum or Labour
Society. When asked
about other Conservative
Party matters, such as
their affiliation with the
rather right-wing Turning
Point UK, Riach stated
that Imperial College
Conservative Party was
no longer associated with
the group.
The event concluded
with a group photo of the
Imperial Conservatives
with Rees-Mogg follow-
ing attempts. Doubtless,
the best moment of the
evening was a photo op-
portunity with Felix. We
hope Rees-Mogg picks up
a copy of the paper in the
future.
Occasionally referred
to as the Honorable
Member for the 18th
Century, Rees-Mogg is
a controversial figure in
modern British politics.
He chaired the highly
Eurosceptic European
Research Group until
September 2019, widely
viewed as propelling
the UK towards Brexit,
and generally stands
on the fiscal and social
right of the Conservative
Party. Currently Lord
President of the Council,
Rees-Mogg has a large
following amongst young
members of the Conserv-
ative Party, appreciating
his upper-class diction
and mannerisms, with a
large social media fol-
lowing and even a group
named Moggmentum in
his honour.

“Members
of the
audience were
enamoured by
Rees-Mogg,
appreciating
his honesty,
mannerisms,
and politics ”
and charismatic. Joseph,
a voter from Northern
Ireland has followed
Rees-Mogg for years
and “loves him 100%.”
However, this adoration
was by no means uni-
versal; a Labour voter
dubbed him a societal
problem and of course,
another member of the
audience strongly disliked
his views on Brexit. Some
audience members didn’t
know what they thought
Imperial Conservative Society invited Jacob Rees-Mogg to a Q&A and a raffle.
