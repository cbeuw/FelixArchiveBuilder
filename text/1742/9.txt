Italian Regional Election Results And Their
Consequences
The Italian region of Emilia-Romagna confirmed its traditional centre-left stance marking the first major defeat
for League’s Matteo Salvini

A
couple of weeks
ago I wrote an
article about the
importance of
the Italian regional elec-
tions for Italy’s national
political equilibria. The
26th of January was to be
the day in which populism
would either continue its
streak of triumph or be
halted in its tracks, and
the people of Emilia-
Romagna delivered
their message. While the
people of the other region
in which elections were
held, Calabria, voted as
forecasted in polls, with
a remarkable majority
(25%) for the centre-right
coalition, the former
region conﬁrmed its sep-
tuagenarian tradition.
slim victory of around 2%
to 4%.
The result is seen as
the first major political
setback for Matteo
Salvini’s far-right
League on the national
stage. He spoke during
election night, along
with defeated candidate
Lucia Borgonzoni,
denying any possible
mistake that could have
led to the election loss.
He instead claimed that
the party was on the right
path, having obtained
massive support in a
region which has always
been a bastion of the
left. More recently he
has been questioned
by some party figures,
among them the League
founder and now es-
tranged leader Umberto
Bossi, although such
criticisms from the party
veteran are nothing new.
Salvini’s status as party
leader has, however, not
been seriously endan-
gered, nor it is likely to
become so.
What these results
have achieved is an
increased stability of
the national govern-
ment, which could have
collapsed in the case of
the League’s victory.
Currently, the gov-
ernment is a coalition
between the centre-left,
plurality winning Dem-
ocratic Party (PD), and
the populist Five Star
Movement (M5S). The
latter party was almost
annihilated in Emil-
ia-Romagna, winning
just over 3% of the vote.
Furthermore, M5S is
currently the strongest
force in the Italian
parliament. Whilst PD’s
victory has strengthened
their commitment to
governing, M5S’s loss
has deepened their fear
of a similar national
election performance.
The Democratic Party
now holds most of the
cards. M5S’s embarrass-
ing result is not their
first: their candidates
have also been recently
crushed in regions such
as Calabria.
An internal process
for M5S to assimilate
the bad news and
channel it into reshaping
the party has no doubt
begun, and it is likely to
deeply shake the party’s
internal structure. Under
this restructuring, the
former political leader
of the M5S, Luigi Di
Maio, has fallen victim:
he has been forced to
resign as leader but
retains his role in the
government as Foreign
Minister.
lives rather than living
under public spotlight.
This announcement
reminds one of the
Roman hero Cincin-
natus, who served his
country loyally through
the darkest hour and then
retired to a life outside
the public eye. It was
nonetheless announced
in a statement which
ends in a declaration
that now is time to “get
their hands dirty”; their
battle against populism
therefore seems not to
be just a parenthesis
in the thick book of
Italian politics but is
destined to continue.
Looking at the calendar,
this assumption seems
to be confirmed by the
fact that more regional
elections will take place
later this year, and in
many cases the League
and the centre-right will
try to win such regions,
possibly striking a fatal
blow to the government.
As Italian politics is
deeply unpredictable,
the government’s
strength could indeed be
eroded in the long term
by the shifting equilibria
evidenced above.
The first major defeat
for the League has nev-
ertheless shown that Mr
Salvini is not unbeatable,
nor is populism. There
is hence a possibility
that this may mark the
beginning of its decline,
or its transformation
into something else, for
better or for worse.

Meanwhile, the
“Sardines”, the polit-
ical movement born
in Emilia-Romagna to
oppose populism and
the League, has been
credited for its role in
successfully bringing
back more moderate
voters to the political
debate. Indeed, a note-
worthy statistic is that
turnout has significantly
increased from 40%
five years ago to almost
70%, reaffirming greater
public interest for these
elections.
The leaders of the
Sardines have confirmed
their intention not to run
