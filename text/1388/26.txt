Victoria Beckham
She is brilliant in Ugly Betty!
She is playing a variation on
herself, a press-hungry celeb-
rity that actaully does nothing.
And I totally love her for being
her superficial self.
Rihanna
She is such a pretty doll!
She’s totally (allegedly) had
a boob job, and it’s probably
anti-feminist to say this, but it
looks great.
Zac Efron
This is quickly becoming
a celebrity-o-meter... But
although Efron looks like a fe-
male to male transexual, that’s
a transexual I would totally do.
