Letter to Felix
Dear Felix,
In response to the letter by Khadhim
Shubber, he joins the chorus of disap-
proval of Dr Watson’s comments and
personal attacks on Dr Watson him-
self. However, just like his compan-
ions - journalists and top scientists
alike, he fails to produce a single piece
of evidence to support his own claims.
These lazy, facile and wholly unscien-
A response to
last week’s letter
criticising Felix’s
article on Dr
Watson
This may sound a bit cliché but...
tific criticisms of Dr Watson highlight
a complete lack of understanding of the
subject they seem to claim complete
knowledge of. Of course, Dr Watson’s
comments were inaccurate, broad
sweeping statements which many
found offensive and unhelpful, but as
his resignation letter shows they were
clearly not motivated by racist views.
Much more importantly, the media
reaction he elicited shows that there
is indeed room for public debate and
a desperate need for public educa-
tion on the subjects of normal human
variation and the effects that genetics
and environment both have on human
behaviour.
Yours sincerely,
Richard Fautley
I
’m sorry, but ‘too’ objective? Too
objective? Perhaps I misread last
week’s letters to Felix, or perhaps
I was so overwhelmed by the as-
shattery of complaining about
too many fire drills when both Huxley
and Blackett still both assemble in the
wrong areas despite having so many
practices, but the “complaint” about
Felix’s handling of the Dr. Watson issue
a couple of weeks back really seemed
to take the piss.
Calling the press ‘too’ objective when
they deal with an issue that’s been
treated as a public bukkake of pure ha-
tred by other publications seems to me
a bit like booking an appointment with
a student counsellor and then smack-
ing their face in with a shovel for being
‘too’ caring.
I have to fight back the gag reflex
that kicks in when I get my morning
paper – the shit-filled, bile-basted tripe
that gets sprayed into newsagents on a
daily basis is physically sickening and
the fact that it remains so popular just
angers me even more – dead or dy-
ing people, the fallen famous, and the
eternal blame game. These headlines
that never let up or disappear without
something equally terrible appearing
as breaking news elsewhere.
We were shocked at the horrific
news of the situation in Burma a few
weeks ago, and it captured the atten-
tion of the world, uniting it in grief and
anger against the inhumanity that was
taking place. Until a few days later, of
course, when the news stories became
a bit samey and we decided to switch
off and move back to the healthier dose
of Eastenders and a shout at Gordon
Brown.
We’re fickle shits who couldn’t give a
toss about what’s really going on in the
world, happier to watch Big Brother
and term is ‘reality’ because calling it
‘reality’ makes us think that we’re not
really living, and so it’s alright that all
that lies ahead of us is a quagmire of
health, wealth and morality issues.
While I understand the desires for an-
other round of “Bash The Racist” that
no doubt prompted the letter to Felix, I
hardly think you can complain when a
media outlet decides to put the flaming
pitchfork down and say what actually
happened. Or did reading the news and
making your own conclusions go out of
fashion along with wearing clothes you
feel comfortable in, and the Pope?
A quick check of the BBC News
website currently reveals the following
– the top news story is that twenty-five
million personal records were sent, un-
encrypted, on two compact discs and
This just in – you all suck
C
lichés have become an
intrinsic part of our eve-
ryday language. Our con-
versations, book titles,
movie clips and essays
abound with them, and many have
already qualified to be ranked as idi-
oms. Some may frown at that. Person-
ally, I think that the cliché has been
much maligned, and deserves a second
chance.
In ignoring clichés, people tend to
miss the obvious question of why they
became clichés in the first place. Al-
though we may have heard them often
enough to cringe at the mere sight of
them, we have to spare a thought for
their origins. Clichés represent hu-
man collective wisdom pared down to
its most memorable. The essence of
self-help – nuggets of advice; though,
granted, as many are of the McDon-
alds variety as are of solid gold. They
did not spring out of nowhere – they
are the result of generations of parents
teaching their children the ways of the
world, eventually discovering simple,
catchy sentences as an effective me-
dium to transmit knowledge.
The other day I heard someone ex-
press surprise when a cliché someone
tossed at him actually made sense.
While I am not suggesting that we are
all guilty of such misconceptions, I do
think that we tend to associate plati-
tude with falseness or at least with ir-
relevance, which is very much not the
case. Clichés only become clichés be-
cause people found them worthwhile
enough to keep repeating. That’s worth
remembering.
There are disadvantages, however,
and I would be the last to pretend that
there are none. The cliché has a lot
to answer for when it comes to mak-
ing our conversations easier. It is al-
most impossible to express emotion
without, quite simply, sounding corny
and ridiculous. Let’s take the most oft-
described, if not the most ubiquitous
emotion, Love. I feel guilty of unpar-
donable sentimentality for even writ-
ing the word. Imagine, then, talking
about the L word without sounding
like a character from a bad romantic
novel.
I make this sound like a genuine
criticism. It’s not. Or at least it is, but
not of the cliché. It’s a criticism of us.
Myself very clearly included. I mourn
the inability of my language to help me
express my feelings, but in doing so I
do it a grave injustice. Our language;
indeed, any language, is eminently
suited to expressions of sentiment. The
problem lies in being original enough
to avoid the appealing clichés which
spring to mind most readily.
The greatest poetry comes from the
expression of human emotions in ex-
actly the right words. Very few of us
are poets, capable of anything more
than the crudest, most basic expres-
sions of feeling. It’s not a criticism of
the cliché, but rather a criticism of our
collective inability to be original. I still
defend the cliché, though – if only for
being a valuable benchmark against
which we can judge our poets. Never-
theless, I think that without them, no-
one would be tempted to move beyond
mere triteness and unoriginality, and
write tomorrow’s poetry; and hence
the clichés of the next generation.

promptly lost. A month ago, I might
add. Just under that, Imran Khan is
freed from his arrest in Pakistan, and
seventy thousand birds are culled be-
cause of a fear of bird flu in Suffolk.
The most read stories, however, are
as follows – a one-hundred-and-one
year-old woman stripping for charity;
a man having sex with a bike and jel-
lyfish attacking some salmon. Fucking
brilliant. And if anything, it’s the inter-
net that’s made us so fucking useless.
There was a time when the only people
who were stupid enough to fall for bi-
ased bullshit in the news were the ones
picking up newspapers for Page Three.
Now, even your average Green lunatic
is falling for it.
The Independent have amused me
non-stop since becoming tabloid-
sized, with headlines that are usually
on some variation of “We’re All Going
To Die In A Blood Mess (And It Is The
Government’s Fault)” with a picture of
Earth on the front and either a giant
meteor, the sun burning a hole in it, or
just Gordon Brown’s face hurtling on a
collision course with it.
There’s barely any point in reading
past the headlines nowadays – shitty
puns tend to give more of a clear news
summary than the actual body does,
and once you get past the introductory
paragraph you’re knee deep in ridicu-
lous and unnecessary social commen-
tary. So here’s a tip for you the next
time you want to know what’s going
on in the world. Point at the person on
the front of TheLondonPaper and say,
“People give him/her a lot of slack, but
I think they’re okay.”
If you get punched in the face, it’s
probably “Bash The Racist” time
again.
