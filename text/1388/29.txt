T
he idea for this expedition
came about from a desire
to climb new rock routes
in a remote location. The
Quimsa Cruz area was
suggested to us by some UKClimbing.
com users who had visited it before and
found that there was a lot of potential
in the area. Our general aim was
to climb new rock routes. Five
students chose to take part:
Hal Watts, Markus Rog-
gan, Bernard Lam, Ben
Withers and myself.
We waddled out
from the Moun-
taineeringClub
equipment
stores in
Beit Quad
like a
group
of
pregnant penguins (if such a thing
were to exist); we were mildly late for
our flight to Bolivia and we were laden
with enough gear to kill a medium-
sized donkey. Thankfully we made it
with time to spare. We had to spend
the night in Santa Cruz airport to catch
our connecting flight; so we ate at Sub-
way for about £1 each, and then found
a comfy spot to sleep in the airport,
which happened to be under a dozen
TVs that soothed us with lovely tra-
ditional Bolivian pan-pipe music. All
night long. We came close to putting
an ice axe through the TVs.
In La Paz we spent a few days buying
supplies and acclimatising. The super-
market employees pointed and laughed
at us when we bought four shopping
trolleys of food, and the kids that
helped us pack the groceries grinned
from ear to ear when we inadvertently
gave them a humungous tip.
The jeeps arrived early in the morn-
ing; we loaded them up and set out
towards the mountains. The driver
claimed to be called Jose but drove
more like McRae. We swept around
tight hairpins, disturbingly close
to sheer drops. We traversed
several turquoise lakes and
passed through a number of
small farming and min-
ing settlements, some
of them abandoned
and decaying. Af-
ter about eight
hours we were
abruptly
greeted by
the moun-
tains.

Virgil Scott and 4 others from Mountaineering Club went to the Quimsa Cruz mountain range
in Bolivia in July to climb new routes and explore the area, looking for rock climbing potential
weeks we attempted to climb as many
routes as possible:
Sunday 1 July
On the first day our plan was to go for
a short walk – exploring the nearby
area. We didn’t want to push our luck
with the altitude by doing anything
too strenuous. We followed the river
up the valley, and then branched off
north to the Col leading to the next
valley in which we would later put our
second advanced camp. Standing on
top of the col gave a stunning view of
the next valley, exposing the enormous
south faces on the opposite side of
the valley. It was oozing with soaring
crack-lines, hundreds of metres long
reaching striking pinnacle summits, no
doubt most, if not all of them, are un-
climbed because they do not get much
sun compared to the mass of rock op-
posite. From the Col we could also see
Illymani – the highest mountain in Bo-
livia. After spending some time enjoy-
ing the views we scrambled to summit
of the peak to the east of the Col.
Monday 2 July
In the evening we carried bivouac gear
for three nights to the east of Laguna
Blanca near the base of Nevada Sat-
urno. On the way up the valley we met
some min- ers coming down
from the mines on the
south side of the valley. They wore dark
cotton clothing, with either a woollen
hat or a baseball cap and carried ruck-
sacks with thin cord for straps. Each
morning, at around 8am they would
walk past our base camp, about an
hour and a half from Viloco up to the
mines, whilst we would barely be out
of bed until sunrise (9:30am) because
it was so cold until then. They were
hardy and jovial – they always greeted
us cheerfully and asked about what we
were doing or where we were going.
Tuesday 3 July
We split up into two groups, Bernard
and Ben set off to the north to find a
climb near the Col next to Saturno.
Hal, Markus and I set off east to take
a look at the south side of Saturno and
the surrounding area. There appeared
to be several good lines up the south
side of Saturno, however since they
were all in the shade we decided to at-
tempt a line on the north facing slabs
opposite Saturno. We inspected the
faces and found several attractive lines,
a couple of overhanging crack-lines to
the east, some blank vertical slabs to
the west, and up the middle was a large
rightward curving crack, this looked to
be the easiest line, and since it was our
first climb we decided it would be best
not to push ourselves too much. As it
turned out we did push ourselves too
much, we had totally misjudged the
top pitch and it turned out to be an ex-
citing section of steep, dirt-filled crack.
As we were not really in a position to
clean it, the climb turned into a con-
stant struggle against the flow of dirt
down the crack. The dirt and shrubs
would gradually slide down the crack
and so the climbing involved attempt-
ing to move faster than the dirt was
sliding. Stopping to catch your breath
would give you an alarming feeling of
being in sinking sand – as your hands
and feet would begin to move down-
wards, so we called this route E-dirt.
Ben and Bernard found a climb to the
north-west of Saturno, a long scramble
where everything was loose. and it was
soon clear that it would be very late
before they would return. They fin-
ished their route late in the afternoon,
just before dark, and returned to base
camp just before midnight.
Wednesday 4 July
Rest day.
Thursday 5 July
We moved up to the Laguna Blanca
camp early in the morning. Markus
and I explored the area to the north
and north-west of Laguna Blanca. We
planned to do a route on the slabs to the
north of the lake but upon inspection it
appeared excessively dirty and had evi-
dence of being climbed so instead we
continued further west and then north
up a gulley to check out the wall that
joined the ridge parallel to the next
valley. Bernard and Ben explored the
slabs below the headwall to the north-
east of Laguna Blanca scrambling up a
