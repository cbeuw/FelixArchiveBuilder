narrowing gulley until it became too
technical for walking poles.
Friday 6 July
We had an early start to attempt a very
attractive line up the slabs to the east-
northeast of Laguna Blanca. Markus
and I climbed this and it turned out
to be a four pitch climb with beau-
tiful crack sections. However, sev-
eral pieces of in-situ gear were found
which suggests this was not a first as-
cent. It would be possible to continue
this climb to the summit of a choice
of pinnacles. We decided not to climb
further as the point reached after four
pitches was the logical end to the aes-
thetic line, and based on the amount
of in-situ gear found up to that point
it would not be a first ascent. In the
evening some small clouds began to
appear, up to this point the weather
had been totally cloudless, and warm
enough to climb in a base layer during
the day. The difference between sun
and shade temperatures was remarka-
ble, entering the shade felt like walking
into the frozen foods department of a
supermarket.
Saturday 7 July
Rest day. There was significant snow-
fall through the night and most of the
higher ground was covered in snow.
Sunday 8 July
Climbing was not possible due to the
snow. Bernard and I explored the val-
ley to the north by walking to the Col
that leads to what we called ‘Torrini’.
It looked stunning but already had
many established routes on it. Ben and
Hal explored ‘the big wall’ area to the
north-northwest of base camp. The
big wall was one of the most inspiring
pieces of rock we found out there. It
was 400-500m of vertical (sometimes
overhanging) rock. We decided we had
to attempt it.
Monday 9 July
More snow, hail and wind throughout
the day. We realised that some kind of
rodent was nibbling on our cereals and
chocolate so we ended up hanging all
our food from bushes and boulders.
Tuesday 10 July
The weather improved and the sun
came out occasionally in-between the
clouds. Hal, Markus and I carried gear
to the base of the big wall and re-
turned to base camp.
Bernard and Ben
climbed a mixed
route (grade
III/4)
on
the slabs near the Col that lead to the
next valley to the north-west of base
camp.
Wednesday 11 July
Hal and I attempted and retreated three
lines on the big wall, the wall turned out
to be very loose and deceptively steep,
difficult and cold, with snow and ice
on many holds. All three lines looked
fairly straightforward but as soon as
we stepped onto them we found the
angles of the holds and formation of
the rock somehow forced us to lean
away as though on a severe overhang.
The amount of loose rock was over-
whelming; the majority of holds were
loose enough to remove with a moder-
ate pull. Rock that seemed solid at first
would then move readily when pulled
from a slightly different direction. If
the rock had been solid the wall would
have been superb, steep climbing, with
very large holds and good gear. How-
ever, instead it was steep with very few
solid holds and the constant stress of
a potential fall onto bad protection.
Occasionally we encountered a short
section of solid rock – these sections
had very good quality climbing. And
this was what encouraged us to con-
tinue. We did not have any success on
the first day but found a promising line
of weakness that we would pursue the
next day. We returned to base camp in
the evening. Ben and Bernard rested
at base camp after completing a mixed
route the day before.
Thursday 12 July
Hal and I climbed 35m on the big wall,
following the line of weakness up a di-
agonal crack that we found on the pre-
vious day. The first pitch was climbed
in mountain boots as there was a sig-
nificant amount of snow and ice. We
set up an anchor after 25m, equalising
5 pieces of gear. The next pitch was cut
short when we encountered an over-
hanging section that was startlingly
loose. We spent a little over 30
minutes clearing loose rock
from a small platform
to en-
able a solid sling belay below this sec-
tion. We had to stop clearing loose rock
eventually when we realised that we
were gradually destroying the platform
that we were sitting on – the rock did
not seem to get any more solid regard-
lessofhowdeepwedug.Westudiedthe
options and decided to try and traverse
rightwards then move up on a leftward
leaning line of weakness. However
this would have to wait until the fol-
lowing day. We abseiled down and left
the ropes to ascend the next day and
then bivouacked next to the lake near
the base of the wall. Markus, Ben and
Bernard traversed the big ridge, start-
ing south-west of base camp.
Friday 13 July
It took an entire day for Hal and I to
traverse 8m in an attempt to find a
line of weakness on the overhanging
section on the big wall. At every stage
we would reassess the possibilities in
terms of finding the best line of weak-
ness with the least loose rock, travers-
ing slightly, then attempting to climb
diagonally up and left, then up and
right, then straight up, failing that we
would traverse further rightwards and
repeat the process. We climbed the
traverse in mountain boots to avoid
cold toes. Eventually we could not go
any further when we could not find
gear placements, so we placed a bolt
by hand, whilst hanging from two mar-
ginal BD micro nuts, in order to retreat
from the position and to leave a solid
anchor to ascend to the next day. Ber-
nard, Ben and Markus climbed a short
icefall to the east of base camp.
Saturday 14 July
Markus, Ben and Bernard climbed
an existing bolted route on Torrini.
Hal and I ascended to the bolt and at-
tempted to make some progress from
there. There appeared to be several op-
tions, either traverse right and follow a
flake system leftwards or trend slightly
leftwards and up to a small ledge or
head diagonally leftwards to a section
of less steep rock. By the end of the day
we had tried all of the options, each
one taking an extraordinary amount of
time. Due to the loose rock each move
required excavation, cleaning and the
testing of many holds. Placing gear was
even more time consuming, most us-
able holds would take a moderate pull
– but not the pull of a fall, so finding
a good placement required more time.
We resorted to a ‘safety in numbers’
idea placing gear at almost every op-
portunity. In spite of this we were not
really willing to push ourselves as we
didn’t trust the gear; getting passed
that crux section (the terrain appeared
to ease off around 15m higher) would
require bold climbing on loose rock
with the possibility of gear ripping. We
discussed alternative tactics and de-
cided that we could no longer pursue
the objective in the same manner so we
abseiled from the anchor (consisting
of 7 equalised parts, including a
bolt). We considered looking for
an easy way to the summit then
abseiling down from the top,
cleaning each pitch and
slinging (or bolting)
anchors. In the
evening, we
walked up
to the
ridge on the west to see if we could find
a way up, but there was no straightfor-
ward way.
Sunday 15 July
Hal walked up the gulley to the east of
the big wall to see if there was a way
to the summit from there whilst I re-
trieved the gear from the big wall (leav-
ing one bolt and one piece of abseil
cord). There was no simple way to the
top so we returned to base camp.
Monday 16 July
We all carried bivi gear to make a camp
in the next valley. Once we had set up
the bivi spot we checked out the sur-
rounding rock. There was a lot of it, and
all of it was north-facing so it received
sunlight for most of the day, which was
a nice change. Unfortunately there was
no running water nearby so we had to
melt snow for water, but it was full of
grit and so had an interesting texture.
Tuesday 17 July
Bernard and I climbed a route which
we named ‘La Cueva Cómoda’ on the
wall we came to know as ‘lower Tor-
rini’. Markus and Ben climbed two
routes, one called ‘Motivationsriss’ on
the lower Torrini and one that Markus
named ‘LaLiLu’ in the ‘mid Torrini’
area. Hal was bruised by loose rock so
could not climb.
Wednesday 18 July
Hal and I inspected, cleaned and prac-
ticed on top-rope the top pitch of a
potential line in the mid Torrini area.
As we had entered the valley we had
all noticed a particularly striking
piece of rock, so we decided
to try and find out if
it would be
climb-
able. It was clear that the hardest
pitch would be the top, which was
fairly accessible from the other side
of the valley. It was a 20m slab that
appeared to have no natural protec-
tion, but had a many small crystals
protruding from its surface. The
climbing was some of the highest
quality we had ever experienced, im-
maculate, solid granite, with a beau-
tifully flowing sequence of moves. It
was the kind of climbing where you
feel ‘in the zone’ after the first move.
Thursday 19 July
Hal and I set off to climb the line we
had looked at the day before. Ben,
Bernard and Markus rested at ad-
vanced camp. The crux pitch went
smoothly, but the diagonally rising
crack-line traverse turned out to be
harder than expected and was also
filled with dirt and moss. About half
way across I had to stop and clean
it out as it was getting hard to see
because of all the moss falling into
my eyes. At one point I turned away
form the wall to spit out some dirt,
this unfortunately landed on Hal.
Friday 20 July
Returned to base camp.
Saturday 21 July
Ben, Hal and I collected the remain-
der of the gear from the advanced
camp in the next valley and returned
to base camp. Markus and Bernard
climbed a three pitch VS 4c near
Cuernos Del Diablo and returned to
base camp in the evening.
Sunday 22 July
We rested at base camp, made prepa-
rations to leave, and packed gear and
food. Andean Summits’ jeeps arrived
in the evening to take us home.
