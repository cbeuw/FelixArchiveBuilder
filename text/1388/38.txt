The long road to success

So you think you’re ready to start train-
ing for a marathon? The marathon is
the longest and most difficult race most
runners ever attempt. It’s also the most
popular. Almost anyone can complete a
marathon, but whether they can com-
plete it without injury or great pain is
the real test. Will you be one of those
who just manages through, or one of
those who finishes with a smile and a
great outlook for the rest of the day?
The general rule is that you need to
have run regularly for 1 to 2 years be-
fore you begin training for a marathon.
Why the wait? A marathon is approxi-
mately 52,400 foot strikes. This will
tear away at your body, especially your
joints. Your body needs to build up to
this kind of abuse and a 26 week (or
less) training program just doesn’t suf-
fice for most people’s bodies to adapt
properly. You will need to find some
runs that you like in your area that suit
your current fitness level. It may be
1, 2, 5 even 10 mile runs that you are
currently doing. Aim to have as many
different routes and distances, with the
aim of avoiding just going out for a run
around the block. By simply going out
on the same run each time, you will
soon get bored and your body will be-
come adapted to it. Vary your routes,
the way in which you run round and
speed. Keep a log of your times.
It is advisable to put in at least 20
miles per week for several months be-
fore you start training for a marathon.
The reasons are the same as those
above. Your body needs time to adapt
to the pounding that it will be taking.
Be sure to run at least 5 miles a week
during this time on pavement, as that
is likely to be what you are running on
in the marathon. Training solely on
a track or trail will cause you to hurt
much worse after the marathon.
It’s also a good idea to try out a few
smaller races, like 5ks or 10ks, even a
halfmarathon(assumingyou’vetrained
for it). This is important because there
are many new experiences that races
bring that regular training does not.
If you haven’t raced before you start
training, be sure to work some into
your schedule. Choosing a full mara-
thon as your first ever race is a sure fire
way to have a tough 26.2 miles!
It may not seem important, but a
great way to get injured is to think you
can just start running long distances
without the proper time and effort.
Just like speed takes years of training
for many people, distance isn’t some-
thing you just jump into. It’s important
to respect the distance (and your body)
by allotting the time you really need.
If you are looking for instant-gratifi-
cation, try a 5k. Marathons are about
patience, including before the starting
line.
It’s important to think about what
race you plan to do. Very hot or very
cold weather is not a great marathon
to start with. You’re limiting your
chances of finishing. The same could
be said about a very hilly course or a
course that is not beginner-friendly.
Find races that advertise they are good
first marathons, like the Free Scale
Marathon. Training in the UK for the
London marathon will normally take
place in the cold wet winter months for
the race in April. This prevents most
people going out, especially in the eve-
nings when it gets dark so early.
If you are going to ignore my advice
about putting in a year or more of run-
ning regularly before you start train-
ing, tell your doctor what your plan is,
perhaps go over the training schedule
you plan to do with him/her. They may
suggest tests (like a cardiovascular
stress test), give you an alternate plan,
or just send you on your way to get
started. There is no reason why some-
one of an average to good fitness level
should not be able to run the whole
way of a marathon. Prepare both your
body and mind, and you will finish.
If your goal is weight loss, and you
think that marathon training is the way
to get there, you are probably headed
down a path to injuries. While you may
lose some fat while training for a mara-
thon, marathons and dieting are a bad
mix. Your body will need nourishment
now more than ever. Eating healthier,
but not having much of a calorie defi-
cit, will help you tone up and yes lose
some during marathon training, but
your major focus needs to be complet-
ing the marathon in good health.
Tips for success ... on long runs drink
water before you run, not too much so
as to make you uncomfortable, and sip
water during the run. Don’t get thirsty.
During the marathon you will have
available isotonic drinks. They are use-
ful for replacing salts and sugar. If you
intend to use them train with them. Eat
a well balanced, sensible diet. You may
find that as the training increases you
eat more. Increase the carbohydrate
content with rice, pasta, bread and
potatoes. Wear the right shoes and kit
that is comfortable. If you pick up an
injury then stop. RICE! Rest. Ice. Com-
pression. Elevation. Don’t start back
too early with your training. A heart
rate monitor is a good investment.
You will know exactly what your body
is doing and how it is reacting to the
demands. Run at approximately 75% of
your maximum which is simply (220 –
age) x 75/100. Intervals help to improve
your fitness and increase your pace.
Run them at a pace that means you can
complete the session. For 1 minute ef-
forts recover for 1 minute with a walk.
On race day don’t do anything different
to your Sunday routine. Training is all
about preparing the body and mind to
achieve what it understands.
Best tip of all - Don’t forget to set your
alarm clock on the day of the race!!
Week 7 and a lot more results are in.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) – (L*4).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year.
With this week’s results in, Net-
ball 1st, Squash Men’s 1st and Tennis
Men’s 2nd are top of the table with 25
points each. With the majority of the
chasing pack wiinning their games this
week, there is very little change except
for Fencing Women’s 1st who at their
weekend tournament came second,
only losing out to Oxford.
A mid table scrap is still there be-
tween the men’s Hockey 2s and Rugby
3s, as well as the ladies Hockey, La-
crosse and Squash
At the bottom of the table the Foot-
ball Men’s 2nd are rooted and are still
looking for that elusive BUSA. Hope-
fully they’ll get it next week.

The winner of last week’s crossword
was nobody, unfortunately. Hopefully
you won’t have quite so much trouble
with this week’s grid of monochrome
ingenuity.
This week I’m going to talk about
sandwich filler because funnily
enough I need something to sand-
wich into this gap. I don’t really like
sandwich filler though, it seems a bit
pointless and cheap when you can buy
some pickle and cheese or something.
