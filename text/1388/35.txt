On 10th November, at 5am, 74 of us
from Imperial College Singaporean So-
ciety waited at Beit Quad for the coach
to University of Nottingham, looking
all bleary-eyed and not the least battle-
ready for the impending Nottingham
Games.
The Nottingham Games were the
equivalent of the Olympics for the Sin-
gaporean Societies all across UK, albeit
held annually but always a highlight in
the Singaporean Society sporting cal-
endar. Every year, we go forth to com-
pete for glory and above all, boasting
rights in various sports like football,
floorball, basketball, netball, ultimate
Frisbee, badminton etc. Competition
was always strong at the Notts Games,
but this year was going to be some-
thing special for us.
The games were held throughout the
whole campus of the university and
once we arrived, we started on our re-
spective games. As usual, our 2 floor-
ball teams hit the floor running, one
emerging victorious in all their games
and the other only losing one, drawing
another and winning all the rest. As a
result, we emerged champions and 2nd
runner-up in floorball.
In ultimate Frisbee, we managed to
clinch 1st runner-up spot after fac-
ing stiff competition from the other
universities. Though emotions ran
high during in the final due to sev-
eral controversial foul calls, the team
still played in the spirit of the game,
exhibiting great composure and level-
headedness.
Football, being one of the most
popular sports, had a great number
of teams and it was a long, hard road
through the group stages. Some of the
teams were more interested in wres-
tling than playing proper football but
we still managed to top our group and
go onto the quarter-finals. We faced
LSE, whom we promptly dismissed
with a 4-0 scoreline and then went on
to the semis. Unfortunately, we lost to
Bristol and had to settle for 2nd run-
ner-up spot after beating Sheffield in
a scintillating game that ended 5-4 in
our favour.
Squash has always been one of our
main sources of medals and in this,
Wong Chong Wai did not disappoint
us. He managed to come in 1st runner
up in Squash Men’s Singles, doing us
proud once again. Two other players,
Andrew Jasudasen and Rajeev Rikhye
fought valiantly but missed out nar-
rowly on getting a medal.
Bridge was also one of the competi-
tive sports at the Notts Games and
we proved ourselves to be more than
adept at this thinking man’s game. The
pairs of Tan Xuan You and Koh Yaht-
ing bested others to come in 1st run-
ner up and so did Xue Kun and Ang
Chieh Hwee as they came in a close
2nd Runner-up.
In Chess, Low Yu Bin also did not go
home empty-handed as he achieved a
2nd runner-up position.
It seemed that we could not stop
winning something in almost every
sport and indeed, there was still more
to come. In Men’s Singles Tennis, Lim
Zhiyang showed off his racket skills,
dominating all his opponents to come
in eventual champion. The Men’s Dou-
Singaporean Society haul medals in Nottingham
Jiaxuan Lu
bles pairing of Boris Iskandar and Li-
onel Wong also gave the rest a run for
their money, clinching 2nd runner-up.
In Basketball, Badminton and Net-
ball, we put up a fight from start to
finish but were unlucky to come away
without anything.
In terms of overall standings, Impe-
rial College came in an unprecedent-
ed 2nd runner up after all the points
were tallied. This added to an already
burgeoning harvest of medals and we
could claim to be a sporting force to be
reckoned with in the next Nottingham
Games.
After gaining so many accolades to
our name, waking up at 5am was well
worth it.
