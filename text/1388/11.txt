Genital Herpes
This also at first does not
present with any symptoms
andcangoweeksundiagnosed.
When symptoms do present
they can include itchiness or
burning around the genitals,
pain when passing urine and
small blisters rather like cold
sores around the genitals that
when burst leave sores. One of
the worst...
Chlamydia
This is a very dangerous in-
fection and does not have any
noticeable symptoms - which
is why it is spread so easily.
In some cases, however, men
will suffer a discharge from the
penis and may experience in-
flammation of the tube leading
to the bladder. If this infection
is left untreated it can result in
infertility, which is certainly not
good!
Genital Warts
Small white spots appear on
genitals – this is the only recog-
nizable symptom but they may
not appear for weeks after in-
fection. Nasty! There is no cure,
and they cause the vast major-
ity of cervical cancer cases.
HIV
Many people now think that
this infection is confined to
Africa but HIV is out there and
anyone can get it at any time
when having unprotected sex.
Some people experience flu-
like symptoms a few weeks
after infection, however it is
usually initially symptomless:
the only way of knowing you
are infected is if you have a
specific test.
Gonorrhea
Often known as the clap, the
symptoms include discharge
from the penis or vagina which
can appear yellow or green.
You can also get pain when
urinating. My eyes are gushing
with water!
Syphilis
This infection was massive
back in the 1800’s however
has come back with avengous
recently. Symptoms normally
begin with a small sore on
the penis or vagina also flu
symptoms may appear if left
untreated can lead to mental
health problems. Lunch is now
not looking so appealing!
Students, in general, get their first
real taste of freedom when they come
to university. It is a time to try new
things, meet new people and gener-
ally start growing up and becoming a
young adult. For most, a part of this
involves sex. Yes. Sex. I said it!
Some of you may be thinking about
becomingsexuallyactive.Othersmight
be thinking about having more sex. By
now you have probably either forgot-
ten all the things you were told during
that sex education class back in school
or you just didn’t pay attention; either
because you were too embarrassed or
shocked or just couldn’t stop giggling.
So this week’s article is all about sex.
The number of people with sexually
transmitted diseases is actually on the
rise in this country. The Health Protec-
tion Agency found that between 2005
and 2006, diagnoses of new sex infec-
tions rose by 2% to 376,508 and most
of these cases were amongst young
people.
It is important, when at university,
to be aware of your surroundings.
Often with a sense of freedom comes
complacency to all things that cause
harm. This may even transpire to hav-
ing unprotected sex with a variety of
partners.
With more and more cases of sexu-
ally transmitted diseases being discov-
ered, not to mention the risk of preg-
nancy, five minutes of unprotected fun
can result in consequences you end up
paying for for a very long time.
Sexually transmitted infections such
as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital
warts, syphilis, gonorrhea and HIV
are out there in the student and wider
community but what exactly are these
infections? See the panel on the right
for a brief rundown.
SHAG Week is a campaign to en-
courage students to be safe when in-
dulging in sexual encounters and to get
them thinking about the consequences
of unprotected sex.
The campaign is aimed to get the
message across in a fun way and there
are lots of event going on all week, so
come along and get involved!
If you think you have an STI it is best
to contact either your GP or the local
GUM clinic on: 020 8846 6699. We’ll
also be handing out leaflets with infor-
mation about sexual health clinics in
the local area, including GUM clinics
where you can get tested for a host of
sexually transmitted infections. There
is also a list of family planning clinics
where you can get advice about con-
traception, pregnancy tests and often
referalls for terminations.
If you are worried about issues relat-
ing to sexual health or have any queries
please do not hesitate to contact the
Information and Advice Centre (see
email address above). There is also a
host of websites where you can find
more specific information on a range
of sexual health issues:

mperial College Union SHAG
(Sexual Health And Guidance)
Week is about to hit our campus!
Despite the name, this is not an
invitation for budding Casano-
vas to demonstrate their sexual prow-
ess everywhere from the dreary depths
of Mech Eng to the dizzy heights of the
Huxley Building. However it is a chance
to talk more openly about the nature of
sexual relationships while indulging in
fun activities, hot entertainments and
picking up lots of sexy freebies.
Every lunchtime next week we will
be giving out S.H.A.G Bags, filled with
useful goodies and important informa-
tion, all around campus. We will also
be teaming up with Boots to give out
free Chlamydia tests and calling for
better Sexual Health facilities to be
made available at the South Kensing-
ton Campus and in our Halls of Resi-
dence. With all this on offer don’t miss
out on getting one of our great red (re-
cycled paper) bags for free!
SHAG Week is not just about enjoy-
ing sex without endangering yourself
and others. It is also about recognising
how Sexual Transmitted Diseases can
destroy other people’s lives. Through-
out the week our educational events
will be raising money for two AIDs
Charities in the run up to World AIDs
Day on the 1st December. You can
show your support by attending our
Sexpression Finale on Friday 30th No-
vember with an exclusive Pole Danc-
ing Show in dBs and an Ann Summers
Party in the Union Dining Hall. Free
drinks receptions will be available at
both Partys which start at 8pm and all
proceeds will be split between Children
With AIDs Charity (CWAC) and Posi-
tively Healthy UK. You can also wear
a red ribbon or a red t-shirt to pledge
your support to these two great AIDs
Charities by giving a small donation at
one of our stalls.
Along with all of our fundraising
activities we will also be making a
stand against AIDs by creating a giant
red ribbon on Upper Dalby Court on
Wednesday afternoon. This is an easy
way that you can show your support
for World AIDs Day while doing some-
thing whacky. Don’t forget to wear
something red or pick up one of our
Charity T-shirts to get involved in this
‘Flash Mob’ event!
I hope there will be something for
everyone during S.H.A.G Week and
however you get involved we should all
be able to do our bit for these incred-
ible charities while challenging and
changing our own perspectives.
The UN Millennium Declaration set a
goal to halt and reverse the spread of
HIV by 2015. In order to achieve this,
a further goal was set of reaching uni-
versal access to treatment by 2010. But
these goals are far from being achieved.
Currently, over 40 million people are
infected with the virus and 25 million
people have already died, whilst 72% of
those in urgent need of anti retroviral
(ARV) therapy remain untreated. The
advent of ARVs has revolutionised the
care of HIV-positive individuals, giving
them a much better quality and length
of life. For the majority of HIV-positive
individuals living in the developing
world, the problem is therefore not the
lack of an existing treatment, but the
lack of political will to provide it.
Politicians of the G8 countries have
repeatedly promised to increase fund-
ing in an attempt to counter the ever-
increasing evidence that the targets for
HIV/AIDS treatment will not be met.
In June this year, they announced a
plan to treble the funding to the Glo-
bal Fund, a major financer in the fight
against HIV/AIDS. But at the ‘Replen-
ishment Conference’ in September,
Gordon Brown announced that the UK
government would provide only half of
the £700million previously promised
over the next three years. With the
UK’s strategy for HIV/AIDS for the
next three years due in early 2008, this
as a poor sign for things to come.
Staying positive about HIV and AIDS
No one ever expected it to be easy
to achieve these goals, but as Gor-
don Brown said in July at the UN, the
promises of politicians of the West
must not be broken if we are to accom-
plish them:
“We cannot allow our promises that
became pledges to descend into just
aspirations, and then wishful thinking,
and then only words that symbolise
broken promises.
We did not make the commitment
to the Millennium Development Goals
only for us to be remembered as the
generation that betrayed promises
rather than honoured them and un-
dermined trust that promises can ever
be kept.”

Help push Gordon Brown to
keep his word. There are plenty
of things you can do in the fight
against HIV/AIDS, such as lob-
bying your MP
. Easy ways to do
this and other things you can
do can be found at: http://peo-
pleandplanet.org/treataidsnow/
takeaction/
If you want to find out more
about HIV/AIDS, or show your
support, come along to some of
the Medsin Positively Red AIDS
Awareness Week events around
campus. All money raised will
be split between two charities:
Children with AIDS Charity, and
Positively Healthy UK.
