Arts
Teacups’ Focus in Arts – Student
A big-arse metal spider? Is that it? I’ll give you some real fucking culture, get your arse over here
T
his week in SAIF we are
back in tow with a truly
enlightening piece of pho-
tography from the same
artist as the breakthrough
‘Rhapsody in Bogroll’.
When prompted for his view on
the piece, a 2nd year Physicist asked,
“What kind of tea leaves are they?” This
provoked a certain train of thought in
my critical brain… What is the steam
representing? Is it the spirit of the As-
sam tea leaves, or the ghost of the tea
picker? This has serious implications
concerning the third world tea grow-
ing… And breakfast.
If the tea is breakfast tea, we start to
wonder what thoughts go through the
artist’s head at this time in the morn-
ing. Cereal or toast? Thus we turn to
the question of the teacup. Why is it il-
luminated so? Immediately, our minds
turn to the messianic symbolism sur-
rounding the piece. With a shift back
to the old tradition of looking to the
future using tealeaves, the artist goes
one step further and tries to say that
this humble piece of crockery could,
in fact, tell us when the Messiah will
return. However, depending on your
religious leanings, it could just be that
the artist used too much flash.
On my brief interview with the art-
ist before she rushed off to her next
caffeine fix, she mentioned the title of
the piece and its meaning: “I called it
Descartes’ Teacup because of the ques-
tion as to it’s existence in the photo. It
seems to have been erased from the
frame completely. Is this one’s bleary
eyed view of the teacup in the morn-
ings when one has been rudely awaken
for her 9am lecture? Perhaps. But we
want it to exist so how can it have been
erased. I’m confusing myself now quite
frankly. You think up some bollocks for
THAT piece of shit.”
This week’s analysis was
provided courtesy of Cardinal
Wolsey. Originally a chief adviser
to Henry VIII until his downfall
and eventual death in 1530. He
now researches for the BBC2 quiz
show QI as well as occasionally
filling in for Jeremy Paxman on
Newsnight.
As Christmas draws near, what
could be a better gift for a loved
one than The Best Of Student
Art In Focus? Class A drugs and
fisting? Probably. But you can’t
get that in Waterstones, because
I checked No-one fucking reads these anyway. Do you? No, you’re too busy looking at the big fucking picture. Knob
