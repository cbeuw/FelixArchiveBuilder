Virgo
Still having the
thought of Rob
in your head and
your constant fear
of being alone
and ending up as
Deirdre, the lady who collects oddly shaped
pieces of the parsnip you immediately take
back the above dumping. Better to have some
readily available sperm than an arid uterus
you constantly intone to yourself like a cock-
hungry fishmonger’s daughter.
Scorpio
YES! You have PFD,
penis flatulence
disorder which
forces your penis to
break wind by some
unusual congenital
intestinal disorder. This also explains your
enforced celibacy as no lady wants warm fart
blown up her growler like stuffing a turkey
with methane. You have however rethought
your stance on celibacy and turn into a slob
who constantly shouts...
Libra
Meanwhile all the
above is going off
you cannot stop
laughing since you
have taken a vow of
celibacy and realise
how above everyone you are by opting out
of such carnal delights. However, I know the
real reason you are laughing, it is to cover the
sound of your penis farting.
Sagittarius
Get your growler
out. Get it out for
the lads. Get it out,
show us every last
little bit of it. Inside.
Outside. Upside
the hizzle. GROWL. GROWL. Grow-grow-
grow-grow-grow-grow -grow-grow-grow-
grow-grow -grow-grow-grow-grow-grow
-grow-grow-grow-grow-grow -grow-grow-
grow-grow-grow -grow-grow-grow-grow-
grow -grow-grow. Consume me!
Capricorn
25 years later, you
are told of corrective
surgery which will
forever rid you
of your trumping
meat-stick. You go
along for a pre-op check up by Dr. R. Nipple,
and you notice a bulge in his trousers in one of
his knees. Oh my god! It is ROB! You are now
part of the twisted love triangle! You die.
Cancer
Mutual masturba-
tion. I could talk
about it in this
space, but I’m not
going to I’m afraid.
Not unless there’s
cheese graters, corkscrews, potato peelers and
a whole load of other kitchen utensils involved.
Contrary to what the Muller yoghurt adverts
say: “pleasure only comes with pain.”
Gemini
This week you
are reminded of
that fling you had
with Rob. You are
thinking maybe that
his lower back-hair
wasn’t that hideous and you should give him
another go. On the other hand, he did have a
disgusting flipper on his knee-cap which also
got overly sweaty when you were doing the
pelvic hurdles. He did also drool on you whilst
he talked. What the fuck were you thinking?
Leo
Tomorrow you will
actually make a
fucking decision and
stop being the little
fucking prick-tease
that you are. You are
worse than that little bitch Sandra who comes
round every wednesday with one tit hanging
out only to shout “PERVERT!” at you when
you look like you are thinking about looking at
her loose mammary. This decision is however
to dump me after the above comment.
Taurus
This week you
think of some witty
horoscopes during
the week. You think
to yourself: “Ah,
that’s a good one
– I’ll have to write that one down this week.”
However, when you actually come to write the
section, you completely forget what they were.
In case you’re wondering, this is not some kind
of horribly SELFREFERENTIAL horoscope
that I did in fact come up with.
Aries
So I met this guy,
he wasn’t actually
a guy, but a male
tortoise, well, not a
male tortoise but an
a-gender nematode,
well, not really a nematode more of a tautology
engaged in passive syntax with an anachro-
nism. This week you will understand what I
mean and weep.
Pisces
Today you misread
Pisces as peices.
YOU ARE AN
IDIOT! Not only
is it not that word,
you forgot i before e
except after c. I hope you’re ashamed as I have
just vomited up one of my kidneys in outrage
and the only way I can restore equilibrium is
by murdering an otter with a plum. A PLUM!
How ridiculous is that? You don’t even deserve
death you maggot-rapist.

Wordoku is identical to sudoku;
we’ve just replaced the numbers
with letters. Once you’ve
completed the puzzle, there
is a hidden word or phrase to
find. Email in your answers to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
The winner of the Wordoku
1,387 was Jenny Yang.
The hidden phrase was
“EQUATIONS”.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week you think
you’re a big playa.
Big pimpin’ and all
that jazz. You start
spitting your chat
to a lady behind the
kiosk in Waitrose. Straight out of the left-field,
she announces that she’s beaten Eminem in
a rap battle in “dat fail 8 Mile. Check it.” Her
flow engulfs you leaving you straight tripping
dawg. Slapped, bish-bang-bosh. In your face.
Hollaaaa!

How to rate yourself:
Under 8 words: “You are as sharp as a
sackful of wet mice” (Foghorn Leghorn).
8 - 13 words: You must have a brain like
teflon - nothing sticks in it. Go away or I
shall taunt you a second time.
14 - 19 words: Careful now, don’t let your
brains go to your head!
20 plus words: Well done, brainy boots!
Last week’s solution:
The seven letter word was:
PHOBIAS
Congratulations if you have phobias.
Other words included:
abos, aphis, apish, bash, bias, boas, haps,
hasp, opah, opahs, phobia, pias, sahib,
soap
How to play
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up with
must include the central letter. Capitalised
words, conjugated verbs (past tense etc),
adverbs ending in “-ly”, comparatives and
superlatives are disallowed. A word you
are not allowed in this case would be “Fe-
lix” as none of the letters can be found in
the polygon. Get it?!
