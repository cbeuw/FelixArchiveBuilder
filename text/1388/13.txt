Stanzas for students: Philip Larkin
Lover, writer, librarian – this week, we go in search of everyone’s favourite miserable bastard
High Windows
When I see a couple of kids
And guess he’s fucking her and she’s
Taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,
I know this is paradise
Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives--
Bonds and gestures pushed to one side
Like an outdated combine harvester,
And everyone young going down the long slide
To happiness, endlessly. I wonder if
Anyone looked at me, forty years back,
And thought, That’ll be the life;
No God any more, or sweating in the dark
About hell and that, or having to hide
What you think of the priest. He
And his lot will all go down the long slide
Like free bloody birds. And immediately
Rather than words comes the thought of high windows:
The sun-comprehending glass,
And beyond it, the deep blue air, that shows
Nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless.
Sad Steps
Groping back to bed after a piss
I part thick curtains, and am startled by
The rapid clouds, the moon’s cleanliness.
Four o’clock: wedge-shadowed gardens lie
Under a cavernous, a wind-picked sky.
There’s something laughable about this,
The way the moon dashes through clouds that blow
Loosely as cannon-smoke to stand apart
(Stone-coloured light sharpening the roofs below)
High and preposterous and separate -
Lozenge of love! Medallion of art!
O wolves of memory! Immensements! No,
One shivers slightly, looking up there.
The hardness and the brightness and the plain
Far-reaching singleness of that wide stare
Is a reminder of the strength and pain
Of being young; that it can’t come again,
But is for others undiminished somewhere.

hilst not quite
Alfie Tennyson
when it comes to
style, Philip Arthur
Larkin is one of
Britain’s most famous contemporary
poets. It’s hard to like the man, by defi-
nition – to like Larkin and his poetry
you need to have a certain amount of
misanthropy and general hatred about
you. But you can at least look at the
verses and smile, which is exactly what
we’re hoping you’ll do this week.
We’ve chosen some pieces from
High Windows, one of Larkin’s more
socially-focused anthologies, but Lark-
ing also wrote more lyrical, less weary
pieces too. This is the man at his best,
though – bitter, sharp and a mite de-
pressed. MySpace with a degree in
English Literature and a flatshare with
Stephen Fry.
First, a little on the poem’s we’ve se-
lected for you. High Windows is the ti-
tle poem for the anthology, and reflects
on the younger generation that Larkin
watched grow up. It was the output of
the Sixties, the first group to benefit
from the sexual revolution and in turn
create a divide between young and old.
Larkin’s call of “paradise” is, of course,
more than a little sarcastic, but what
keeps him thinking the most is the per-
ception of his generation from the one
above them.
When he was the age of the “kids”,
people thought that his generation
would be the one to be liberated. Free-
dom of speech and expression would
allow them to live “the life”, no religion
or manual labour, just the long slide
down.
Down is symbolic here for Larkin,
though, as he wasn’t exactly a fan of
the freedom the young enjoyed. It was
partly down to jealousy, as he himself
admits in other poems, but here he
tails off into more speculative thoughts
– high, unreachable windows bursting
out onto open sky and freedom. Yet
they remain too high, the deep blue
air being something he can only watch
from distance.
Our second piece is “Sad Steps”, a
more morose selection from the an-
thology that shows some more inter-
esting bits of Larkin’s style. Here we see
Larkin getting up in the early morning
and trying to see beauty in the scene in
front of him.
“Groping back to bed after a piss” is
characteristic of the coarseness he uses
to play off against more poetic images
such as “the moon’s cleanliness”. Here
we have a very normal situation that is
suddenly changed by the presence of a
natural beauty.
But, Larkin being Larkin, he finds it
hard to see the magic. The fourth stan-
za (verse) is another piece of sarcasm,
as he can only “shiver” when he looks at
the view, thinking of those who see the
same view, the same beauty, but win
out over him because of the “strength”
they possess in the youth they have not
yet spent.
This is characteristic of Larkin’s
struggle with age and with decay.
Whilst he bemoans the young, he often
mourns his lack of youth – not so much
because he wasted his, but because it is
gone and now unretrievable.
Larkin himself was something of a
tragic figure, described by close friends
as having been middle-aged since his
early teens. He had a pathological fear
of death, old age, commitment and
more, and though he had a strangely
childlike devotion to his mother –
whose death affected him greatly – he
was conspicuously less childlike in
other respects.
Obsessions with pornography, fas-
cism and racism were hinted at in
posthumous biographies and books of
letters, and though many of Larkin’s
close friends deny it, the view does fit
in with much of his life and works.
Much of what we could have known
about him, however, has been lost. He
asked Monica Jones, a lifelong com-
panion of his, to destroy more than
thirty volumes of diaries and letters
upon his death.
Despite that, much of his character
has filtered through into history. His
letters to Kingsley Amis, a close friend,
reveal a lot about him, as do records of
his relationships with women. Though
he never married, he had two long-
term and simultaneous relationships
with Monica Jones and Maeve Bren-
nan, two very opposed women whom
eventually learned of his duplicity in
love.
For a librarian who lived most of
his life in Hull – a place he hated, and
thus loved for exactly that reason – he
wasn’t such a boring character. His po-
etry has great variety over the course of
his life, and remains well worth reading
to the day.
Larkin was offered the Poet Laureate
position in 1984, but turned it down
over the thought of becoming so cen-
tral in the media. His poetry often crit-
icised those who studied him, and not
in a flattering light. Just one year after
turning down the position, he died of
cancer. He was sixty-three years old.
Still genuinely readable to the day,
Larkin’s work is still thought of as
“people’s poetry”, and rightly so.
High Windows can be bought
online for the princely sum of
£5.49, probably from amazon.
co.uk or another equally giant
internet retailer. Go get it, and
don’t look back. You’ll be a better
person for it
