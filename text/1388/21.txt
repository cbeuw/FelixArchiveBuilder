Last week saw the first Union Trading
Forum take place in the Union Bar and
was organised it to gather the views and
opinions of our members who use our
services. Over thirty students turned up
to give their opinions and views of the
Unions’ services (or maybe just to eat
free sandwiches) and I’ve summarised
some of the points that were raised.
A large number of our members
commented on the lack of glasses
and the use of non-rigid plastic
skiffs. The non-rigid plastic skiffs,
which are disposable, contravene our
environmental policy, and were re-
introduced as a consequence of a supply
issue with the rigid skiffs this summer.
Once the supply issues were resolved,
a stock of rigid skiffs were ordered
immediately, as such we had a large
amount of disposable skiffs left over
which are used infrequently.
Other concerns regarding the
environmental policy included a lack
of non-disposable cutlery, which
disappered from service earlier in the
term; a result of the large amount of
cutlery being stolen. Fortunately we have
just received a new stock of cutlery and
plates, which, if you have eaten in da
Vinci’s recently, you may have noticed.
There were a number of negative
comments on the speed of service, both
within our catering outlets and in the
bars. This is a recurring issue that we are
well aware of and is likely to be the result
of training. Due to the large number of
part-time student staff we employ; it
can be difficult to ensure a consistently
high level of service. This year we have
increased the level of training our part-
time bar staff receive and feel this has
been reflected by the quality of service in
our bars. We have attempted to reduce
the lunchtime queues in da Vinci’s by
moving some of the speedier foods into
dBs, where you can get hot soup, paninis
and sandwiches throughout the day.
Another idea raised regarding the bars
was to the introduction of more drink
promotions. This is something which
I am keen to introduce, so I will be
working with Trading to deliver more
promotions in the near future.
Additionally,
some members
commented on our
entertainments
program, with
some positive
comments
regarding
Freshers’ Week
and our newly
introduced Bar
FTSE. Remember you can see all of our
upcoming entertainments can be found
in Felix each week as well as on our
website.
Over the next few months I hope to
gather the views of more members,
though should you experience any
problems whilst using our services, don’t
hesitate to send an email or drop into my
office.
Finally, my thanks to all of those who
turned up to air their views, they are
valued and are important to make change
within the Union.
