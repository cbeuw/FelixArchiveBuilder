7 > 74: Council’s new maths Brian May slowly taking
over the world of academia
Being a world famous rock star is a fairly worthy achievement in
life, but Queen guitarist Brian May isn’t stopping there. Having
recently become Dr May during the summer, he has since gone a
step further. On Monday he was confirmed as the new Chancellor
for Liverpool John Moores University. Essentially, he will be crucial
in raising the university’s profile by acting as an ambassador,
something that shouldn’t be too difficult judging by the amount of
column inches he has generated since returning to academia.
Severe flaws in Imperial College Un-
ion’s election procedures were high-
lighted as the purpose of the RON
campaign was undermined and ren-
dered pointless.
At Monday night’s Council meeting,
a by-election was held to fill the out-
standing positions from last month’s
student-body election. However, one
candidate who had previously been
beaten by RON (Re-Open Nomina-
tions) in the undergraduate CGCU-
wide election stood again and was suc-
cessfully elected as a Councillor, even
though she garnered even fewer votes
this time round compared to last.
In last month’s Council elections the
candidate in question, Rosie Smithells,
collected 8 votes out of 74. 11 under-
graduate engineering students voted
RON. Students are supposed to vote
RON if they are not satisfied that the
candidates running are up to scratch.
In the event of RON winning, the elec-
tions are supposed to be run again,
however since this process takes about
a month the Union decided to run a
by-election at Council.
Council is an open meeting but due
to the political apathy on campus it is
rarely attended by anyone other than
Councillors and the most keen of stu-
dents, thus only 7 people present were
eligible to vote for the “Undergraduate
Engineering Representative” category,
compared to 74 voters in the original
election. Owen Connick received 5
votes, whilst Rosie Smithells collected
the remaining 2 votes leaving RON
with 0. Thus RON lost by only 2 votes
in the by-election, but won by 3 votes
in the original election.
Ms Smithells was perfectly entitled
to re-run for a position on Council;
nothing prohibits this in the Union
Constitution (a huge document detail-
ing the ins-and-outs of how the Union
must be run), however the whole de-
bacle has highlighted how flawed the
elections procedures are.
In the current system, 7 votes cast by
engineers present at a Council by-elec-
tion hold more weight than 74 votes
from the whole engineering body. This
suggests that the views held by peo-
ple who turn up to Council (an event
which even the politically-interested
find too boring to contemplate attend-
ing) are more valuable than the views
of those who were interested enough
to actually vote in the election-proper.
Furthermore, the purpose of RON
has been questioned. Currently RON
functions with the hope that more can-
didates will come forward in the sub-
sequent election, however the system
is flawed when nobody new stands; a
persistent candidate can keep standing
for election unless they are beaten to it

& Andrew Somerville
Going back to basics
by someone else.
In theory, the electorate can keep
voting RON until the candidate im-
proves their election campaign or gets
fed up with standing. However, the
electorate effectively changed during
these Council elections: from a faculty-
wide pool of students to one restricted
to those who bothered to attend Mon-
day night’s committee meeting. It has
been argued that nothing was strictly
wrong with the by-election since it
was open to all engineering students.
Whilst true, this is hugely unrealis-
tic; advertising for the by-election has
been nonexistent, and even then how
many students are willing to turn up
to a meeting compared to going online
and voting?
If Ms Smithells had written a mani-
festo or campaigned at all for the initial
election she would have almost cer-
tainly been elected, but at least she has
turned up to all the Council sessions
this term. One candidate who was suc-
cessfully elected during the by-elec-
tion didn’t even attend the by-election
meeting due to having rugby practice
on Mondays. Council is always held on
a Monday, begging the question, how
will Mr Saleme be able to attend in fu-
ture meetings if he can’t even make it
to his own election?
In fact, the only person not to be
elected at the by-election was one Jon
Matthews, last seen storming out of
Council following his resignation after
the second rejection of his GSA report,
losing by 11 votes to Amar Joshi.
Electing Councillors has been a pain-
ful process this year and there are still
positions to be filled on the committee.
The problems with the election proc-
ess need examining; it is absurd that
someone can re-run for an election
so soon after the student body has de-
cided they are not fit for the position,
especially when the second pool of
voters is smaller than the first. As with
all democracy, it seems that those with
the most hunger for power will always
be the ones being “elected”.
Candidate successfully elected with 2 votes having been
rejected in a faculty-wide election only weeks beforehand
