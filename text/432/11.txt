IC daisy pickers save a point
U C F i r s t s 1 IC First 1
The game started very
scrappily with very little
constructive play from either
side. I C were complacent a n d
lethargic, L i n d o n g showing a s
much enthusiasm a s a eunuch
in a brothel, and Huntington
playing i n a mental fog after
his rapid promotion to the
dizzy heights of the first team,
However Steve G e e showed
signs of life a n d on several
occasions he a c t u a l l y raised a
canter, proving what a night
of abstinence can do for y o u .
T h a first half wore on and
finished without serious
incident. (Half tin® 0 —0).
E a r l y i n the second half the
crowd (one gardener) w a s
stunned to silence a s the
sequence o f events leading to
the U C goal unfolded. Baker,
•who w a s intent on carnal
mayhem, joined with B r a b b i n ,
who was taking time off from
his daisy p i c k i n g , a n d both
spectated the departure of a
U C forward a s he calmly
stroked the b a l l past the
outstretched hands of the I C
keeper A l l e n .
Injuries
IC were then floored once
more a s C h r i s Howley and
P a t Frampton made Bugner and
Dunn look like B i l l a n d B e n .
With a resounding crash the
two gladiators f e l l to the
ground with hideous head
injuries seemingly to take no
further part in the game.
With 9 men I C surged
forward but time w a s t i c k i n g
away. Grimwade h a d a shot
scrambled off the l i n e . A
header from L i n d o n g scraped
the outside of the post from a
well-struck Huntington free-
k i c k . With minutes to go
Frampton and Howley returned
to the game swathed from head
to foot i n elastroplast.
Seconds remaining, a . free-
k i c k struck by Grimwade into
the U C penalty area for
Huntington to pivouette on a
sixpence and strike the ball
somehow into the net o n h i s
third attempt. F i n a l score 1—1.
. . . . while Seconds 'Superstars' demolish nets
I C ' s 'Wednesday 2 n d team'
took to the field at Shenley last
Wednesday i n a confident frame
of mi'nd, following the 3—1
defeat of K i n g s C o l l e g e
Hospital Seconds the previous
Wednesday.
P l a y i n g down the slope i n
the first half, I C were soon
1—0 u p when P a u l Garnham
nodded a precise free k i c k
from the soon-to-be-injured
captain, Gordon P i c k e r i n g ,
over the keeper's h e a d . Three
more were to follow before
half time.
F i r s t , 'superstar' midfield
player, P a u l Heidn w a s given
too much space i n the U C
penalty area; he turned quickly
to lob the b a l l over the
advancing keeper.
A good back-heel from
Garnham s a w John Demnite
through to beat two men before
snooting none d e c i s i v e l y .
U C launched f e w attacks
in this period and these a l l
were e a s i l y dealt with b y Pete
Rutty and John Hargreaves. Just
before half time, Gareth
Roberts, the Welsh w i z a r d ,
shot from wide on the right o f
the U C penalty area to make
it 4 - 0 to I C .
U C became more aggressive
in the second half, but I C had
the experienced cool of
P i c k e r i n g at right back, and
F i n n i s i n goal to keep them
at bay.
A s the half progressed I C
again began to get o n top a s
knightly and Johnson pressured
the U C defence.
With ten minutes remaining,
up popped that m a n , H e i d n ,
again, to shoot nome from
20 yards, and make the final
score, 5 - 0 to I C .

I C seconds, p l a y i n g their
first c l u b opposition of the
s e a s o n , gave a very impressive
performance to a d d to their
run of v i c t o r i e s .
I C lost the toss and ' Q u i n s
choose to play against the
w i n d , giving I C the advantage
in the first half.
The advantage quickly
showed a s the ball w a s
permanently i n the ' Q u i n s
half. A series of quick passes
put Armstrong over for a try
in the corner. I C increased
their lead when ' Q u i n s fumbled
a high k i c k and G i b s o n picked
up the loose ball and dived
over the line to make it 8—0.
The third try w a s similar
to the first, Gregory scoring
in the corner after good work
by Dunleary. 12—0 at half time.
IC then turned to face the
w i n d and w i t h i n 5 minutes had
added another try from B l o c k .
From then on the play swung
from end to end with teams
scoring alternately, 3 tries
e a c h . T h e I C tries a l l came
from good, well-supported
breaks and P a r k i n s o n , Siornak
and Dunleary scored tries which
were converted by Gregory, to
make it 34 — 16 at the final
w h i s t l e .
In a fast, e x c i t i n g a n d
s k i l f u l match I C showed the
ability with w h i c h they
have w o n their first four games,
conceeding only 23 points while
scoring a massive total of
206. T h e forwards d i d particul-
arly w e l l against the heavier a n d
more experienced 'Quins
pack and provided the driving
force for this good w i n by
giving good b a l l to the backs
who used it w e l l a n d made
strong runs.

I C began the s e a s o n w e l l
against a side of tricky
'Indians', w h o had some
s k i l f u l individuals.
The C o l l e g e h a d the better
of the first half, with Dougal
dominant i n m i d f i e l d . T h i s
lead to a goal, just before
half time, by F a t a n i a .
The second half saw C r a n -
w e l l putting their game together
to pressure the I C defence. It
was this- period that w o n the
day for I C , w h o held out
extremely w e l l , thus frustrating
the opposition. There were
some fine performances from
H u c k l e , C u l l u m , Barrett and
M c R o b i e .
Cranwell d i d , however,
manage to soore a hotly
disputed ' o f f s i d e ' g o a l .

the calmer IC midfield took over
and good work by Sethi l e d to

• After sampling the local
ale, the hatsman began the
game in fine spirit, controlling
the game on a fine p i t c h . I C ,
however, proved unable to take
advantage of shrewd approach
work by Parker and C r e e k .
J e s u s took the lead with the
last h i t of the first half, a n d
only their second shot at goaL
The second half began in
reverse (!) with J e s u s dominat-
ing the g a m e Despite this
I C ' s Miller a n d Middleton
scored from breakaways.
The third I C goal w a s the
best, a w e l l worked short
corner enabling Sethi to s c o r e .
Then the beer started to take
effect o n the I C team and
Hutson w a s blinded by two
incredible g o a l s . Fortunately
Middleton h a d added another
with a sort of under-head hit(!!)
to give us a justified victory.

On Saturday the 16th Oct, the
X,-Country c l u b paid i t s second
v i s i t to Party H i l l F i e l d s .
On this o c c a s i o n we were to
be spared the a g o n i z i n g five
and a .half miles of a mud bath.
In its place we were to part-
icipate in a relay race c o n s i s t i n g
of 6 legs of \Ya miles — the
U C relay.
IC, with the help of a few
welcome ' o u t s i d e r s ' , managed
to field 3 teams. Steve Webb
led off for the l s t team a n d i n
an extremely keen first l e g d i d
very w e l l , putting the team in
13th place with a run o f 8
mins 2 4 s e c s . Unfortunately
after this l e g the 3rd team were
ahead of the 2nd (oops).
In face of fierce competition
I C ' s l s t team held onto 13th
place throughout the race,
thanks to good runs from D
R o s e n and G S w e l l . T h e 2nd
team pulled up 3 or 4 places
to finish 33rd and the 3rd
team dropping to 37th. T h e
winners, incidently, were
Birmingham University.
