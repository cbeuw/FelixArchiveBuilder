Lesser characters shine through
Thomas Stevenson takes a look at the
Young V i c Theatre.
The Young V i c , in The Cut near
Waterloo Station, was founded in 1970 as
a branch of the National Theatre, then
occupying the nearby Old V i c . Since then
the National has moved into its beautiful
new home and the Young V i c has become
independent under its original director
Frank Dun lop. The theatre is designed
to serve a young audience; the seats
are cheap and hard and the dec/or is
strictly functional. The audience s i t s on
red-stained benches around three s i d e s of
the stage giving an intimate actor-
audience relationship.
The autumn season opened recently
with Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra,
directed by Frank Dunlop. Although the
programme notes have no hesitation in
telling us that this is one of the greatest
poems ever written, this production
concentrates on the actions rather than
the words. T h i s is hardly surprising when
you have a French Cleopatra, Delphine
Seyrig, admittedly with a fine command of
E n g l i s h , who has some difficulty with the
verse, and an Antony in Michael Graham
C o x , who does not have sufficient range
to reach the anger of the battlefield.
That s a i d , the production concentrates
admirably on the lesser characters.
Geoffrey Hutchings delights as the tipsy
Lepidus in the famous drunken scene,
w h i l s t A l f r e d L y n c h ' s Enobarbus has a l l •
the heroics that Antony l a c k s . There is
an excellent clarity and haste which
must appeal to the primarily adolescent
audience. Carl Toms' s k i - s l o p e set
proves sometimes trecherous to the cast
and gives more the impression of an
Egyptian desert than of the private
palaces of Rome and Egypt in which s o
much of the play is set.
In repertoire with Antony and Cleo-
patra is Robert B o l t ' s A Man For All
Seasons. T h i s - i s the famous account of
Sir Thomas More's stubborn c o n s c i e n c e
r e s i s t i n g the birth of the established
Church of E n g l a n d . Its director, Stewart
Trotter, won the HM -Tennent Award for
the best production outside the West End
with his version of The Browning
Version by Sir Terrence Rattigan. T h i s
production suffers from a spectacular
piece of mis-casting with Alfred Lynch
as More, looking like nothing so much
as one of Norfolk's water s p a n i e l s . It
is surely a mistake in this intimate theatre
to rely so heavily on make-up for an
actor to appear what he is not.
Michael Graham C o x ' s Comman Man,
on the other hand, is perfect. He takes
in the assortment of bit parts; steward,
boatman, publican, jury foreman and
story-teller, with consummate ease and
builds up an engaging relationship with
the audience, taking no side in the
argument but leading us through the
complexities of the sixteenth century.
F i n a l l y , be warned that both these
plays may be ' O ' level texts and the
audience might consist of four hundred
schoolgirls who find the speech of
Cleopatra's eunuch, Mardian, irrestistably
funny. I look forward to their November
production of a Stoppard double-bill with
interest.
No placelessness nor timelessness
At the National Thomas Stevenson
A l e k s e i Arbuzov is one of R u s s i a ' s
most popular current playwrights; his
play Tanya, written in 1938,has apparently
a l w a y s been in performance somewhere in
the Soviet U n i o n . Old World, which joined
the Royal Shakespeare Company's reper-
toire at the A l d w y c h last week is
presently playing fifty theatres in
R u s s i a .
And yet, apart from names and obvious
references there is nothing particularly
R u s s i a n about this play. Both characters
have been strongly affected by the war
but despite their heavy losses this is
not a t i m e l e s s n e s s and p l a c e l e s s n e s s
even though the author tries hard to
fix us in Riga in August 1968. Perhaps
in the Soviet Union the play's production
can be slanted to present two individuals
in a brief e s c a p e from a -collective life,
but not in London WC2.
Anthony Quayle and Peggy Ashcroft
play the two characters — a doctor and
his patient at a Sanatorium. She has come
from M o s c o w , where she works in a

standing, is a slightly bitter misogynist
awaiting a v i s i t from his daughter who
lives in Japan. In his beautifully con-
structed play their pasts are gradually
unfolded and a tenderness develops
which culminates in a scene at the
doctor's w i f e ' s grave in a military
cemetery.
Peggy Ashcroft, looking remarkably
young for a l l her years, performs with a
gay abandon which would do credit to a
woman half her age. At the restaurnat

daring Moscow fashion they perform a
slightly drunken dance with great care
and, in a cracked voice she sings one
of her old c i r c u s songs. Anthony Quayle

have helped him to give up smoking/

Meanwhile, on the other side of
Waterloo Bridge, the National Theatre's
main auditorium — the Olivier Theatre —
has opened with a long overdue production
of Christopher Marlowe's epic Tamburlalne
The Great. And what a production to
open this magnificent theatre! With a
cast of fifty the play shows the conquest
of the world from Europe to P e r s i a by a
Persian shepherd who never loses. A
Renaissance at the New Victoria Theatre
(17th October)
Renaissance music is rather unique;
they produce graceful n e o - c l a s s i c a l tunes
that often embody a great depth of feeling.
They're very much a k i n to Peter Frampton
in that they're a British group who've
made it big in the US and who are only
just reapping some s u c c e s s over here.
Last Sunday was indeed entertaining,
marred only s l i g h t l y at the end by a lack
of concentration or sincerity during bits
of 'Mother Russia', the group's tribute to
Alexander S o l z e n i t s y n , and 'The Song Of
Scheherazade'.
Barring that the group were in good
form from the start, as were the know-
ledgeable audience. Their reportoire (the
group's spanned three studio L P s , ' A s h e s
Are Burning', 'Turn of the Cards' and
Scheherazade And Other Stones'. 'Can
You Understand', from the first of these,
opened the 90-minute set. L i k e so many
of their songs the melodic tones of

Tumburlaine returns victorious once
again.
Albert F i n n e y is Tamburlaine, a part
which s u i t s him perfectly; at first the
sinewy shepherd dealing brusquely with
his enemies and then the ageing widower
cruel in his tyranny. His wife, Zenocrate,
played by Susan Fleetwood, is the only
influence he w i l l accept, and it is duly
her pleading that w i l l save her father,
the only victim to be spared.
Chief amongst Tamburlaine's adver-
saries is B a j a z e t h , Emperor of Turkey,
who arrives in great magnificence,
accompanied by his queen. In art amusing
scene B a j e z e t h , played by Dennis Qui I ley,

in the dreadfulness of their treatment of

himself by beating his brains out on t h *
bars of the tiny cafe in which Tamburlaine
has secured him.
The verse speaking is excellent and
the fast pace is kept up throughout the
four hours w h i c h the play lasts.
The new theatre is superb. Although
the audience is arranged in a 180° arc
around the stage, the two side blocks
are raised so thdt there is no feeling of
being in a vast s e a of heads.The auditorium
is so steeply raked that you are almost
unconscious of anyone sitting in front

The more conventional 'Running Hard'
was next up, and this, together with
'Gypsy' r e a l l y goes to show why John
Tout is one of the two lynchpins of
R e n a i s s a n c e , Annie being the other. He
dominates the band's music with a
varied set of keyboard and synthesizer
noises that are oft gradually built into
a d e a r cacophony of engrossing sounds.
Except for the two aforementioned
tracks the evening went extremely w e l l ;
the group were c a l l e d back for the now
obligatory encore of 'Ashes Are Burning',
ending as usual with a s p e c t a c u l a r
mirror-ball lighting effect. A n n i e ' s v o i c e
bounced around the theatre and then
they were gone.
