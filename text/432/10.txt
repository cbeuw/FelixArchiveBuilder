EXTERNAL AFFAIRS Debating Society
The University of London Union has
two main aims. The first is to bring
together students from a l l c o l l e g e s within
the University v i a Sporting C l u b s and
Societies, catering for a wide range of
a c t i v i t i e s not found in the smaller
c o l l e g e s . Many of the sports clubs
compete at a very high level and represent
the University in British University
Sports Federation competitions. T h e
other aim i s to represent student views
to the University authorities on matters
which are not confined to a single
college. U L U therefore has three main
areas of activity - Sports, Societies and
the Students Representative C o u n c i l
(SRC).
H
o
w it's all run
Each function i s run by a seperate
body. In the case of the clubs and
s o c i e t i e s it is a committee comprising
representatives from each individual
c l u b / s o c i e t y ; In the c a s e of the S R C
it is a committee of delegates from a l l
the c o l l e g e s within the University, the
number of delegates being roughly
proportional to the number of students at
that c o l l e g e . T h e s e three bodies, the
Sports C o u n c i l , Societies C o u n c i l and
S R C are co-ordinated by the General
Purposes Committee, consisting of
representatives from each committee,
together with the President and Deputy
President. The latter two are sabbatical
officers elected annually by a joint
meeting of the C l u b s and Societies
committees and the S R C . The G P C also
has overall responsibility for Sennet and
overlooks the U n i o n ' s financial expendi-
ture. T h e Union is financed directly by
the University and this y e a r ' s budget
is of the order of £120,000.
Orange Mole on SRC Exec
The S R C i s the only student body
recognised by London University a s a
negotiating body and consequently
represents students on matters of
University wide Interest such a s Inter-
collegiate H a l l s . It a l s o sends elected
representatives to the Joint Committee of
Senate/Students Representative C o u n c i l .
IC usually sends three or four delegates
to S R C meetings usually the President,
External A f f a i r s Officer and U L U R e p ,
who this year is -D H a r r i s s o n . We a l s o
have Derrick Everett who last year w a s
e Iected as a member of the S R C E x e c — qu i ie
a surprise s i n c e the S R C i s dominated bv
the Broad Left, and they usually carve up
the elections between themselves. In fact
both this year's President and Deputy
President, Richard Silver and L y n
Millington-Wallace are Broad Left members
Structure report expected
At present a working party i s invest-
igating the structure of U L U and i s
supposed to report back soon with
proposals to change the basis of member-
ship from individual members to a
structure more akin to N U S that is a
confederation of c o l l e g e U n i o n s . U L U
membership cards are necessary when
you w i s h to use the f a c i l i t i e s offered at
Malet S t , and are a v a i l a b l e from your
Constituant C o l l e g e Union offices not
from the ICU office.

F o l l o w i n g the large amount of interest
shown at the Freshers F a i r , the Debating
Society is organising a varied series of
meetings for this year. We have two awards
to be won — a n i n t e r - C C U trophy and a
freshers pot.
There are a l s o plans for a debate
between two prominent outside speakers,
p o s s i b l y Members of Parliament. Later on
this year, the C o l l e g e may enter a team
for a national students debating competition
organised b y the 'Observer' newspaper.
However, the first debate to be held this
year w i l l be a part of the series of the
i n t e r - C C U debates. F u l l details w i l l be
advertised throughout C o l l e g e and i n
the near future.
The C C U trophy i s to be contested on
a league b a s i s ; each union entering one
or more teams of three people. T h e
freshers pot may be awarded to the first
year student w h o performs the best in
these debates, or, if there i s sufficient
interest, by a ' b a l l o o n debate' later on i n
the year. A l l those interested in taking
part in these debates should contact
their C C U office.
