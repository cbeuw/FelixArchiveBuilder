F E L I X , O C T O B E R 29th 1976 - 5
F i r s t l y confirmation that the well-known Comedian Ralph
McTell i s definitely booked for November 20th; Split Enz for tne
following Saturday (27th) and Flamin' Groovies w i l l be giging here
on December 11th. T h e s e , together with the Horslips concert o n
13th November look like the full list of Great H a l l concerts s e t
for this term. A s soon a s I'm given details of support a c t s , prices
etc I'll let youknow.
There are plenty of interesting gigs happening this w e e k e n d .
On F r i d a y , the best i s likely to be at the O l d T o w n H a l l , F u l h a m
where Roogalator are headlining with a couple of punks, the
Clash and Vibrators. P r i c e i s £ 1 .
Gardens las yet to succeed
If y o u c a n afford to drink until 2am, then the Suprise Sisters
play the R o c k Garden F r i d a y and Saturday, S o far, this C l u b ,
which was intended to be a n alternative t o the expensive D i n g w a l l s
and Speakeasy, hasn't really got off the ground. T h e trouble i s
its too small and has little or no atmosphere to make prospective
c l i e n t e l flock to the place i n great numbers. P r i c e s though,
compared to Dingwalls and the other late night g i g at the Speak-
easy are much cheaper. Lager i s 40p a s opposed to the 52p at
Dingwalls or the (gulp!) 60p at the Speakeasy. Shorts are about
lOp cheaper at the Garden than the other two haunts. A d m i s s i o n
too, i s generally lower. If you've any of your grant left, you might
want to check it out.
The Four Tops make a rare London appearence at Hammersmith
Odeon on Saturady, so too do those ex-patriots Climax Chicago,
who play a hastily arranged concert at the V i c t o r i a P a l a c e . L S E
put on Hinkley's Heroes, featuring a host of name musicians that
include Boz Burell and Simon Kirke of Bad Company, ex-Hendrix
drummer Mitch Mitchell, Henry McCullough, and Kohomo's Mel
Collins. £1.20 at the door. F o r me though, a l l roads lead to the
N a s h v i l l e , where Stranglers take the stage. Surely the best band
around who have yet to sign a recording contract. T h e place w i l l
be packed, s o those of you interested should get ther w e l l before
the doors open at £1 at the door.
On Sunday, Eric Bur don p l a y s h i s first London date for a few
years at the Roundhouse C h a l k F a r m . Burlesque provide great
entertainment at the N a s h v i l l e for 50p.
