Sterling Silver meets Pirate Brown
Left to right: Leo Martini-Brown, Mike Williams, Richard Silver.
Veteran F e l i x m a n Mike
Williams w a s c a l l e d out of
retirement to referee the
battle of the giants on T u e s d a y ,
and the giants on this o c c a s i o n
were L e o Martini-Brown,
general secretary of the new
B r i t i s h Students A s s o c i a t i o n
and Richard Silver, P r e s i d e n t
of U L U .
In a half-hour S T O I C
d i s c u s s i o n broadcast to I C
students, live (at 1pm) a n d
recorded (at 6pm), the main
issue w a s whether the short-
comings of N U S finances
justified the formation of a n
alternative union that would
break student solidarity i n the
face of government c u t - b a c k s .
"The student movement needs
to be united," said Mr Silver,
w h i l s t Mr Martini-Brown d e s -
cribed N U S a s a n "inefficient
business machine."
Mr Martini-Brown c l a i m e d
that the N U S executive w a s
quite unrepresentative of the
v i e w s of the student majority,
and a c c u s e d it of supporting
the I R A a n d o f being more
r a d i c a l than the T U C i n i t s
opposition to wage-restraint
p o l i c y . "Students should have
a perfect right of choice of
their national u n i o n , " he s a i d ,
and emphasised that B S A aims
at individual response before
corporate a f f i l i a t i o n . "The
BSA has no political position
at all," he s a i d .
A practical i s s u e w a s
r a i s e d about the p o s s i b l e
effects of a genuinely demo-
cratic election of N U S officers.
"Professional student
politicians" would be the
result, according to Mr S i l v e r ,
and this to him was undesirable.
When a s k e d about the city
business s u b s i d i s e r s of the
pirate. union, M r Martini-
Brown assured that there were
no strings attacked, a n d that
B S A would be internally
funded w i t h i n three years.
