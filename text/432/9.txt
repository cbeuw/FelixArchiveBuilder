Ittfan to
Name a
lane
Dear Sir, — With the increasing
complexity of one-way systems
in London, it i s now not only
difficult to get where one
wants,but it i s a l s o i n c r e a s i n g l y
difficult to be directed over a
new route by someone who
knows the w a y . T o overcome
this, a new technique has been
devised It c o n s i s t s of naming
the lane required by an
appropriate p o l i t i c a n . E . g . A
four lane one w a y street may
be divided into the M i c h a e l
F o o t , Shirly W i l l i a m s , Edward
Heath« and E n o c h P o w e l l
lanes. " S i m i l a r l y , turnings
might be referred to a s ' A
quick Looney B e n n ' .
There i s obviously room for
expansion of terminolgy. A n
olf lady who drives down the
middle of a two w a y street
might be a C y r i l Smith. 1 leave
the developements to your
readers, pausing only to note,
that i n I C a U-turn might be
refered to a s a Sonia Hochfelder.

Discount
fallacies
Dear s i r , - Monday's F E L I X
carried a much needed
a n a l y s i s of the p l a c e s around
South K e n that give discounts
to holders of the new N U S
discount c a r d . Unfortunately
the article d i d not include a
c r i t i c a l appraisal of the true
worth of the scheme.
For example y o u might
have to spend £20 to recoup
your initial £2 outlay. D i d
you know that a l l the theatres
give student discount to
holders of any v a l i d student
ID card? A s for the hotels
and restaurants, I have to
laugh at discounts there. O n
a grant it i s difficult enough
to afford a c l e a n weekend, let
alone a dirty one!
Moreover most of the
publications listed give the
same discounts to a l l bonefide
students.
That covers 7 5 % of the
local places l i s t e d . T h e only
shops where the card would
be useful are ' W . H . Smith,
Clothes shops, hairdressers
and record shops. I realise
that this letter g i v e s the
NSDS card a harsh treatment,
this i s because I have borne
in mind that the card i s
supposed to help stretch the
grant further. In fact the
card w i l l oniy make living
cheaper for students w h o
can afford to buy more expen-
s i v e a r t i c l e s than those
students on a grant.
F i n a l l y , if N U S really
want to make student life
financially e a s i e r , then they
ought to campaign harder for
higher grants. Or i s it because
Charles C l a r k e and C o want
to get into Parliament that
they kept last year's grants
campaign on a very low key?
Yours sincerely

P h y s i c s 2 .
Dear S i r , — H o w kind of the
NUS to arrange the discounts
listed i n today's F p L I X . T h e
implication of your article i s
that y o u -need- a National
Student D i s c o u n t C a r d to
obtain a l l t h e goods or
services .described; but this
is far frQm the truth.
I have been a Times reader
for the past nine years at the
cheap rate and even my most
recent cheque from them didn't
mention an N U S C a r d .
Furthermore student discounts
are a v a i l a b l e , certainly at
The National, at The Royal
Shakespeare Company
( A l d w y c h ) ' to members of a
recognised student body and
there i s no need to offer
NUS card.
B y the way, why does NUS
suddenly feel it has to charge
for a service it h a s provided
free for s o long? Another
example of infinite inflation?
Yours sincerely

reply
Dear S i r , — L a s t week Mr
Williams attacked Soc S o c and
raised some points that I
would like to go over, namely
(i) are we competant to, a n d
should w e , debate p o l i t i c a l
issues?
(ii) Individual action versus
individuals acting c o l l e c t i v e l y ,
and
(iii) What is the function of an
U G M and the union?
F i r s t l y , the argument that
the government knows best
may be e a s i l y shown to be
f a l s e . If the people are not
competant to think about
p o l i t i c a l i s s u e s , by what
argument c a n they meaningfully
elect people to do this for
them?
N e v e r t h e l e s s , we do have
p o l i t i c i a n s ; but are they really
more informed than the rest of
us? After a l l , they have a lot
to d e a l w i t h . T h e fact that
people want to think about
world i s s u e s i s made c l e a r by
the quantities of news and
comment put out d a i l y .
Secondly, it i s doubtful
that the • democracy that Mr
Williams holds so dear would

action of people over the
