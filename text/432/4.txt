IfltcttfaM,
Not very much i n this w e e k ' s article.
R e a s o n — I'm s t i l l reading last w e e k ' s
F E L I X which graced the stands on
Monday and I have to write this w e e k s
article at the same time. However I have
managed to cobble together a couple of
items w h i c h may (or may not) be of
interest or relevance:-
•
N
U
S Travel
F o l l o w i n g last weeks broadsidev
of
NUS T r a v e l and their apparent l a c k o f
a c t i v i t y , I managed to a w a k e n , a n d
receive a letter from, Dave Aaronovitch
( V P S e r v i c e s , N U S E x e c u t i v e ) saying,
.that the office w i l l be open from 11.00 to
2.00 on Thursdays only and the rest of the
time we w i l l have to go to V i c t o r i a , w h i c h
is the next nearest office.
PRES
CUTTINGS
by IC Union President
Nick Brayshaw
T o quote h i s letter: 'We would
apologise for this lack of service and
should also be grateful if you would
apologise on our behalf to your students
for this rather regrettable sequence of
communication breakdowns'.
So, not only do they say we can have
a. travel office for only 3 hours p e r
week (which works out at a rental for the
room of £8.88 per hour o f opening time),
they a l s o want me to do their apologising
for <hem. Well, I f a i l to s e e how the
office can make a profit if it i s only
open ott Thurs lunchtimes, s o — K E E P
