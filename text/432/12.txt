Maths students are less w e l l
prepared for university courses
than they used to be, concludes
the v i c e - c h a n c e l l o r s ' committee
( C . V . C . P . ) . T h e trouble i s that
the wider range of the
cirriculum at school results i n

knowledge. (Report from the
Times Higher Education
Supplement).

NUS Nursery Report
Only 59 out of 821 institutions
of higher education provide
nursery f a c i l i t i e s , according to
a new N U S report — i n other

5,000 parent students. Out of
84 universities only 31 provide
any form of d a y care, a n d
fees are not standardised. Kent

and a new nursery i s l i k e l y to

Astronomical Cut-backs
P u b l i c expenditure cuts and
the rise i n subscriptions to

Science R e s e a r c h C o u n c i l ' s
budget to one sixth less in real
terms i n 1980 than i n 1973,
according to the c o u n c i l ' s
annual report. C u t - b a c k s b y the
S R C w i l l affect i t s nuclear
p h y s i c s programmes (from £41
m i l l i o n to £29.5 million pa) and
its space research (from £26
m i l l i o n to £20 million) and
university education and
research may ultimately be h i t ,
despite i n i t i a l plans to increase
expenditure i n these f i e l d s . A
saving of nearly £Vi m i l l i o n
c o u l d be made by a suggested
c l o s i n g of the two particle
accelerators, N i n a (at the
Daresbury Laboratories) and
Nimrod (at the Rutherford
Laboratories). Although N i n a ' s
closure had already been
planned, the closure of Nimrod
would harm research on the new
particle for the discovery of

this week awarded the Nobel

F E A R S
A s some of you w i l l already
know the government plans to
raise the fees for home and
overseas undergraduates from
£182 and £416 p a respectively
to £650, and to raise post-
grad fees from £250 to £750.
T h i s staggering rise i s
unlikely t o affect the home
student, living o n a l e a grant,
but w i l l hit overseas students
and the estimated 10,000
postgraduates (chiefly s c i e n t i s t s )
dependent on industrial
s u b s i d i e s , a n d i s l i k e l y to
result i n a decline in their
numbers.
The plans have provoked
opposition from the Committee
of V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r s a n d
P r i n c i p a l s , the C o u n c i l of
L o c a l E d u c a t i o n Authorities
and the A s s o c i a t i o n of Univer-
sity T e a c h e r s . A proposed
increase i n hall fees for
overseas students at the
P o l y t e c h n i c of Central London
has been attacked i n a strongly-
worded article i n " M c G a r e l " ,
the P o l y ' s student paper, o n
the grounds of i t s r a c i a l
discrimination.

years. History has shown that
individuals have only been
effective when acting a s groups.
I do not s e e this changing i n
the near future, and to suppose
that things are otherwise, runs
the risk of putting a l l your eggs
in one basket. In order to
act a s a group, the first thing
is to decide what needs to be
done. T h i s implies reasoned
debate. Most people, after a l l ,
are undecided over i s s u e s
until they have talked them over
with several other people with
with different-view points. T h e
U G M is the place to do this.
The second thing we must do
and the most important of a l l ,
having decided on our position
is a c t i n ways to forward our
c a s e .
Mr Williams has said that
we (Soc, Soc) are cut off from
the majoritory of students at
IC. So we are: they don't come
to U G M ' s . F o r Gods sake,
everyone come. S a y what y o u
want perhaps then something
can be done.

Energv Secretary, T o n y

Sunday to give a talk on
' D e m o c r a c y ' . He outlined the
historic development of the

economy.

Mr Benn went o n to describe
his thoughts o n C a p i t a l i s m ,
unfair to workers a n d , he
reckoned, a failure — and
Industrial Democracy, i n
which he believes workers must
participate in management.
H i s principle i s that no one
group or c l a s s should dominate
the people at large. Furthermore
Jhe individual must be guided
by h i s c o n s c i e n c e , says Mr
B e n n , even if this leads h i m

be a very good system, he s a i d ,

and at least it allows workers
to change the Government
without a revolution.
