Money problems at Sennet
Guilds smash
up Harrods

outside Harrods
G u i l d s Union did an estimated
£200\s worth of damage to
Harrods, last Saturday, when
one of their competitors in
the annual ' S i l l y Sports' com-
petition accidently fell into a
small plate g l a s s window.
The girl concerned was not
seriously hurt, although she
was cut around her posterior.
T h e reason for the high cost
of damage l i e s in the fact that
a l l Harrods windows are fitted
with 'trembler' sensing d e v i s e s
to thwart thieves and bomb
outrages. It i s romoured that
the G u i l d s action started the
evacuation of two floors of
the store.
C & G Union w i l l not have to
pay for the damage, although
a store representative warned
G u i l d s not to ask Harrods for
a Rag donation.
The S i l l y Sports proved
very s u c c e s s f u l and £341.40
was c o l l e c t e d for charity. R C S
U n i o n , c o l l e c t i n g outside the
Motor Show at E a r l s Court
netted £188 in ninety minutes.

The long-terrr. future of Sennet. London's Student Paper,
seems uncertain following its non-publication on Wednesday.
The paper is self-financing and has to meet its printing bills
with advertising revenue to ensure publication. On this
week's issue there was insufficient advertising to cover
even a four page issue.
a d e c i s i o n by the Sennet
editorial board is expected
by C h r i s t m a s . T w o ideas
seriously being considered
are a reducation in circulation
and a fortnightly Sennet,
It was Mr S i l v e r ' s d e c i s i o n ,
a s Chairman of U L U ' s General
Purposes Committee ( G P C ) ,
to cancel this w e e k ' s Sennet.
T h e G P C acts as a financial
watchdog over the paper in
view of l o s s e s incurred by
the paper in the last few
years. Any loss by Sennet has
to be made up from funds
otherwise destined for U L U
sports and s o c i a l c l u b s .
However Sennet's Advert-
i s i n g Manager, Anne Tudor,
assured F E L I X that the paper
already had enough advertising
to produce issues for the
next two w e e k s . T h i s was
confirmed by R i c h a r d Silver,
University of London Union
( U L U ) President.
Up t i l l this year Sennet had
received a grant from G P C ,
equivalent to a Science
Research C o u n c i l P o s t
Graduate grant. T h i s was to
sustain a sabbatical editor.
Arrangements are now
different and the paper gets
a loan from G P C , a proportion
of which has to be repaid
each week. Sennet s t i l l gets
its offices within the U L U
B u i l d i n g free of charge, but
Sennet executives have to
report each week to Mr Silver
on the paper's financial
health.
In the short-term neither
Richard Silver nor Anne
Tudor see the paper's non-
appearance affecting its
affecting b u s i n e s s confidence
in it.
However, Anne Tudor does
see problems in the future,
'After Christmas London
could be without its own
student paper.' She feels that
'certain other student pub-
lications that have come on
the advertising scene' c a u s i n g
Sennet's revenue to drop. On
the other hand Richard Silver
sees problems ahead should
National Student come out
more regularly.
A c t i o n t o counter decreasing
revenue is already being
drawn up by Sennet staff and
Mascot wrangles
Allegations are flying
between the RCS and C&G
Union offices following an
abortive attempt by Guilds to
steal RCS's mascot, Theta, at
the Mathematics Fresher's
dinner on Tuesday.
The mascot raid came just
before the start of the dinner,
as Theta was being driven to
level one Sherfield Building in
a JR van. As the van approached
the building two Guildsmen
blocked the entrance into the
dinner. Guilds then claim that
when the ,14 doors were opened
they were more people in the
van than expected, so the raid
was called off.
RCS tell a different tale.
They say that the Guildsmen
were caught between two
factions of scientists and a
fracas developed. C&GU
refute that their members
were involved in this fight,
but admit that Guildsheet
editor John Elkin thought that
his buddies were- in trouble.
Mr Elkin drove his car at
the gathering mob at the
entrance to the Sherfield
Building. Here he was surround-
ed by the mob and his ignition
keys removed. Although the
fracas continued, say RCS,
Theta was successfully passed
over the bonnet of Mr Elkins
car into the dinner.
No-one was seriously hurt,
although two RCS freshers
received cuts to their legs'
during the incident. One
Theta bearer was pinned
to the wall of the Sherfield
Building by the car, thus
sustaining bruises to his legs.
Mr Elkin drove off using a
spare set of keys.

Keogh death
It i s with deep regret that
the Union has to announce
the death of Mr Mohammed
Haliar Rahman.
Mr Rahman was a P o s t -
graduate . in the Chemistry
department and intending to
return home to Bangladesh at
the beginning of next year.
He was found dead in his room
in Keogh last weekend by a
friend, a post mortem has
since shown that he died
peacefully of natural c a u s e s .
We would like to take this
opportunity to pass on con-
dolences to his friends and
r e l a t i v e s .
