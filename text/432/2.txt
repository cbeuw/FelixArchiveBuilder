Flower arranging & all that
A l s o on the s o c i a l s i d e , w e hope to
encourage s o c i a l intercourse between
P G s at department l e v e l . We c a n offer
small s u b s i d i e s and large amounts of
advice to anybody interested in organising
them. '
Our Work during the summer with the
a s s o c i a t e d studies department to s u e if
the A s s o c i a t e d and General studies
could be better advertised for P G s is now
bearing fruit. Many P G s have already
signed up to broaden the frontiers of
their c o n s c i o u s minds and many more
are attending the lunch hour programmes.
There are several courses which do not
start until the spring, and the general
studies are open to anybody, any
Tuesday or Thursday lunchtime. For more
d e t a i l s , contact your department office
or else the A s s o c i a t e d Studies office.
Subsidies
The beginning of term rush i s finally
dying down, and most of the people who
came here to take flower arranging have
finally found the error of their ways —
although the first few weeks of a physics
degree can be misleading.
The Postgraduate group i s beginning
to awaken to the new blood in our
membership. A very promising number of
P G s contacted the group at the freshers
fair and showed a n active interest in the
group's a c t i v i t i e s . B y the time C l i v e ' s .
cosmic word shuffling equipment has
finished with this article, the first P G
committee of the term w i l l be over.
Hopefully, this austere body w i l l have
deliberated on the course and content of
the group's a c t i v i t i e s for the next few
months.
A s far a s the s o c i a l side of the
groups a c t i v i t i e s g o , I hope soon to be
able to announce the first P G extravaganza
of the term. In the meanwhile, bright
ideas for future events are always
welcome, providing they are reasonably
decent and legal.
Back to Politics
Meanwhile, in the big bad outside
world, the fee situation for 1977—78 i s
s t i l l simmering. A s new proposals come
in, it begins to sound more like an
auction than a debate. T h e U L U P o s t -
graduate Committee is at the moment
trying to c o l l e c t i t s views on this matter.
In the meantime, it w i l l help us to
a s s e s s the effect on IC P G s if those who
contemplate hardship or financial
difficulties in the event of a large rise
in fees, could get in touch with me.
I should have more to tell y o u in my
next article, after the committee meeting,
Don't forget to look out for the greatest
s o c i a l event s i n c e the s i n k i n g of the
T i t a n i c . Well—back to my flower arranging.

WELFARE
by IC Union Welfare
Officer John Morgan
Welcome to the Welfare Column; a s
you might have gathered from the Freshers
edition of F E L I X the elected Welfare
Officer managed to fail h i s exams, along
with other illustrious individuals, hence
leaving the position vacant. Sue K a l i c i n s k i ,
last year's Welfare Officer, nobly held
the fort in a temporary nature but now I
have taken over and the Union has a
fully fledged Welfare Officer, elected
and actually in s i t u .
Enough of the internal problems. It is
the actual a c t i v i t i e s of the Welfare
Centre that are of most concern to y o u .
The Welfare Centre i s on the third floor
of the Union B u i l d i n g and is open
daily between 12.30 and 13.30. You're
always welcome to drop in or phone
(Internal 2898).
The centre is manned by Don A d i n g t o n ,
the Student Counsellor, on Tuesdays
and Thursdays, and by myself or some
other student during the rest of the week.
It is hoped that there w i l l be a legal
advice service on Wednesdays later on in
the term.This w i l l be provided by students
from the London School of economics.
Well, what does the Centre provide?
What follows is a brief resume of some
of the sectors in which welfare is
involved.
Accommodation
We have some info on flat agencies
that are hopefully s t i l l in existence and
not too crooked. T h e centre c a n a l s o
help if you run into difficulties with flat
a g e n c i e s . F o r instance when you go to
an agency they have no right to charge
you for providing addresses.

Btfepiinfog
The centre i s not offering to take
over the IC Nursery's r o l e , but if you
would like to earn some money baby-
sitting or require a sitter please inform
the Welfare Centre and we w i l l operate
as a referal agencv.
Canrfttess
A s Welfare Officer i automatically
serve on a variety of C o l l e g e committees
and am hence in a position to put forward
your views in places where they w i l l
be heard. So if y o u have any queries or
complaints please feel able to put
them to me.
Defective Goods
If y o u buy goods from a consumer
outlet, n o e x c l u s i o n c l a u s e s , however
worded, are binding in L a w . So whatever
the guarantee s a y s , you are s t i l l protected
under consumer L a w s . If y o u have any
queries please contact us.
Family Planning
A subject we a l l know about. Or do
we? If you would like any information or
addresses of local c l i n i c s please drop
into the centre. Confidentiality is a s s u r e d ,
as always in these matters.
Law
If you have a legal problem I c a n
contact the college s o l i c i t o r on your
behalf and obtain the requisite information.
The above guide is nowhere near an
exhaustive list of our a c t i v i t i e s . If you
have any queries or want a free c u p of
coffee just c a l l in at the Centre. If w e
don't know the answer we w i l l try our
upmost to find someone who does.
I hope y o u w i l l follow this Welfare
weekly in future. I intend to write a n
article (difficult for a Miner!) about various
subjects of importance. Next week the Ins
and Outs of the Rent A c t .

ICWA
Treasure hunts,
frivolity
discos & general
Now that the novelty of lecture going
has worn off, ICWA has decided to run
a Treasure Hunt Competition. Next week
the first c l u e w i l l appear in F E L I X and
(for the benefit of those w h o only read
F E L I X fortnightly) the first clue w i l l be
repeated the week after. Thereafter a
further three c l u e s w i l l appear, one each
week for three w e e k s .
The cost of entering w i l l be 20p ( a l l
entry fees to R a g ) and each answer
must be sent to Room 98 Beit H a l l , to
arrive not later than the following Thurs-
day lunchtime. T h e final winner w i l l be
presented with £10 at the ICWA d i s c o
on Sat 11th December. Hopefully every-
thing w i l l be made clearer next week
with the appearance of the first c l u e .
P l e a s e take part — its a l l in a good
c a u s e .
Elections
A s I said nomination papers went up
today. There are v a c a n c i e s for the
posts of H o n S e c , Treasurer, Mines
Rep, L i f e Sciences Rep, Ents Officer,
P u b l i c i t y Officer, Freshers R e p and
vlr ICWA.
Freshers' Voice
The poor freshers get inundated with
committees offering the post of Freshers
R e p . However in this c a s e it i s a very
important post a s it w i l l be our only
contact with Freshers opinion and
their only chance to comment, a s a l l
d e c i s i o n s are taken at committee.

In line with last y e a r ' s d e c i s i o n Mr
ICWA w i l l not be the man with the
'nobbliest knees' but the man most
w i l l i n g to help ICWA. If he happens to
have nobbly knees a s well that's fine —
maybe h i s father is a millionaire and
w i l l i n g to make some generous donations,
perhaps he c a n print posters, type (the
candidate not h i s father). Whatever your
motive is) please stand for one of the
above posts we need a l l the enthusiastic
helpers we can find.
Discos.
F i n a l l y I would like to mention the
ICWA d i s c o tomorrow night. Entry is free
and it should brighten up what could be
another boring Saturday evening. Don't
forget i t ' s in the Union from 8pm till
midnight.
