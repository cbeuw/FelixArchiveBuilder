CHANGE OF STYLE WORKS WONDERS FOR RORY
Rory Gallagher - ' C a l l i n g Card* -
Chrysalis
Many reviewers have in the past put
Rory's music down as 'predictable and
'holding few surprises' — yet the crowds
that flock to see him tell a different tale
of this down-to-earth rythm "iC guitarist.
They can't say the same about this
L P 'cause although the Irishman has
put his distinct stamp on al I the cuts, the
album is so unlike G a l l a g h e r ' s previous
efforts. Rory has come out of the confines
of down-the-line rock ' n ' roll and produced
a diverse L P that is versatile and
unconsciously commercial. ' P r o d u c e d ' is
strictly speaking the wrong word since
ex-Deep Purple b a s s i s t Roger Glover is
the accredited producer; he's done an
excellent job and without him the new
styles could have come out a lot worse.
I f i
n d the L P difficult to review in
detail it's just so good, but so unexpect-
edly varied. From the start the music has
a greater feel to it than on previous
Gallagher L P s . The guitar/keyboard
interplay between Rory and Lou Martin
has been greatly enchanced so that there
is more texture to the songs without the
usual accompanying loss of f e e l .
On the heavier 'adrenalin builder'
numbers, such as 'Secret Agent' and
'Country Mile', Roger G l o v e r has preserved
an awful lot of c l i n t y , bringing out the
'new' background intricacies. On the more
peaceful numbers both Rory and Roger
have e x c e r c i s e d expert control, which
may well be why the L P appears s o
uncharacteristic of Gallagher. 'Calling
Card', 'Edged in Blue' and ' / ' / / Admit
You've Gone' are a l l prime examples of
this. 'Edged' is probably the album's best
song. It's a beautiful number that has a
vast amount of cheerful melodies in it,
which is unusual for a blues player.
One thing I ought to mention is that
Rory's gone in for a fair amount of
overdubbing on this L P , something
which he's refrained from trying before.
L i k e the album, his efforts here are
s u c c e s s f u l .
To conclude, 'Calling Card' is a
progressive L P in the truest sense.
Rory devotees may scorn the jumps he's
made but I think they'll grow to love his
new direction. A l l in a l l a great album,
but one that's bedeviled me as a reviewer.
I dare say it has done the same to a few
other self-appointed music ' o f f i c i a n a d o e s ' .

Lost over Hammersmith fly-over
Commander Cody and hjs Lost Planet
Airmen 'We've Got A L i v e One Here' -
Warner Bros
To many a would be truck driver,
Commander C and the L P A were just
about the best thing to come out of the
Southern States s i n c e Comfort. Sadly,
they're no longer with us, but have left
the world with the best kind of epitaph
any band could w i s h for.
The Airmen were perhaps the arche-
typal good-time band, that's why listening
to this live double set, its difficult
actually trying to write about it, instead
all I want to do is just sit back, tap my
feet and get blind drunk.
Recorded at Hammersmith, Aylsbury
and Oxford on their last B r i t i s h tour, the
album contains all the songs that made
the L P A a band that were a bit s p e c i a l ;
ranging from the late forties jazz tinged
country of 'Smoke, Smoke, Smoke,' with
the sort of c l o s e smooth harmonies
that accompanied most of Roy Rodgers'
great songs, the traditional country of
'San Antonio Rose', 'Milkcow Blues' and
'My Window Faces the South', the rock-
abilly feel of 'Hot Rod Lincoln', Too
Much Fun' and 'Lost in the Ozone', and of
course, the truck drivin' songs. No one
could play this stuff quite like the Airmen.
Be it tongue in cheek weepies Jike
'Mama Hated D e i s e l s , to the d r i v i n '
18 Wheels' or Lookin' Through the World
Through a Windscreen'.
Everything that those stoned T e x a s
croonies stood for is recorded for
prosperity on this album. The last thing
the Commander and his men would want
anybody to do is write paragraphs
a n y l y s i n g their m u s i c . They were a l l
about having a good time, which is
exactly what this album g i v e s y o u .

L A C K O F C O H E S I O N D O G S R E V A M P E D STRAWBS
The Strawbs - 'Deep C u t s ' - Polydor
Super
I used to be a great Strawbs fan back
in 1972 when they were on A & M Records
and turning out delights such as 'Grave
New World'. That was before the
Hudson-Ford split and just before Dave
Lambert joined the band.
The pernennial Dave C o u s i n s and Mr
Lambert are the only two remnants of
that .era on ' C u t s ' . The album features
their* lovely bouncy hit single •'/ Only
want My Love To Grow In You', and to
my knowledge is their first effort for
Oyster Records (distributed by Polydor).
The rest of the album is generally
disappointing except for two numbers
'Simple Visions', which opens side two,
and 'Turn Me Round'. The other numbers
are either unispired acoustic copies of
old 'Strawb-type' music or rather cluttered
heavier tracks.
Take 'Charmer', for instance; it opens
with a headstrong a'nd heavy p a s s a g e
ffiat goes into a rather bland bubblegum
ditty that won't endear them to many
a customer. Half the album is l i k e w i s e
second-rate.
The main trouble seems to be an
absence of cohesion between the band
members, who individually are capable
Thumbs down here too
The Average White Band - Soul Search-
ing (Atlantic)
...And speaking of the A W B , their
latest offering does leave a few doubts,
in it's w a k e . It starts off just dandy, with
a nifty little intorduction by the name of
'overture', and then in are led the Average
White patented w a i l i n g brass backbeat
disco-musics of ' L o v e you- life' and
'I'm the one'. A l l very good tried and
tested mannerisms- (they must have
shares in the patentit office). James
Brown has trodden the path of repetition
and even he, the minister of new super-
heavy funi, has suffered for it. How
can deese me rely-mortal honkies hope
to survive?-
T h i s album has received a fairly
widespread thumbs-down from the music
papers but, in a l l fairness, it's not as
bad as-they make out. Anything the A W B
release w i l l be compared with the White
album that broke them into the big boys
league. That was an inspired piece af
music-making on A t l a n t i c - p l a s t i c and it's
not fair to constantly compare their
product with it's e x c e l l e n c e . 'Soul
searching' _y normal standards is a good
album. A s with the 'Moon' L P no effort
or expense has been spared in it's
production and recocding, Hamish
Stuart's voice is back in form, the brass-
work is tight with the rhythm-section
apparently recovered from the loss of
Robbie Mcintosh, and .again Arif Mardin
produces. So it's a l l really down to the
strength of the s o n g s . They're not bad,
simply not as good as those that have
gone before.
A multitude of s e s s i o n e r s have joined
the Scottish sextet (apologies to Steve
Ferrone) for the venture. The BrecKers
and Marvin Stamm add their metronomic
sax/trumpet muscle to the already
formidable powers of Roger B a l l and
of great things, but don't pull together
most of the time. The group seem to be
pecveying too many musical s t y l e s .
Despite this the harmonies are generally
very good and some of the Dave Lambert's
guitar breaks deserve better material.
H e ' s particularly good on 'SimpleVisions',
where Dave C o u s i n s manages, at long
last, to get some Duckhams to his
croaky v o c a l s . The track pounds along
quite w e l l , and with a bit of editing could
make a good s i n g l e . A general thumbs
down although some of the lyrics are
really quite good.

" M o l l i e " Duncan, while ex-kokomoid J i m
Mul lenapplies his axework on 'Sunny Days'
etc, e t c , etc.
It's around the second half of side T w o
that the proceedings start to sound a
little lame. 'Everybody's darling' just
stands around filling in space and on
'Would you stay' the band out-do the
countless US soul combos who churn out
this boring old dirge in their s l e e p . It's
bluesy soul arriving about ten years too
late for the interview, and asking for the
job. They can do much better.
When the A W B write a good song or
riff they normally extend it into a long
rhythmic or vocal spree. Now, although
they're currently only w r i t i n g ordinary
songs, they s t i l l try the same gambit,
resulting in a long, ordinary song with
vocal or rhythmic e x c e s s e s ad nausea.
Result: boredom.
What the three-pound-plus paying
punter is left with then is one good
side, well up to scratch, and a couple of
so-so tracks on side two. The rest does
the average White's hard-earned reputation
no good at a l l . Shame, that.
