Rachel Gillespie discusses the potential applications of psychedelic drugs for treating anxiety
and depression

t was like a space shuttle

to the weightlessness
and majesty of space…”
These are the words
of Patrick Mettes, a
participant in a recent clinical
trial looking into the effects
of psilocybin – the active
component of aptly named
‘magic’ mushrooms – on
depression and anxiety in
cancer.
The findings of this
study, conducted at New
York University, are
published in the Journal of
Psychopharmacology, side-
by-side with those of a similar
trial from John Hopkins
University. The results from the
two groups were remarkably
similar, and showed that a
single high dose of psilocybin
was successful in lifting anxiety
and depression in patients
with advanced cancer for six
months or longer.
Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic
compound that, similar to
the related recreational
drug LSD, acts on serotonin
receptors in regions of the
brain responsible for non-
verbal imagery and emotion.
Overall, this produces a
dream-like state lasting up to
eight hours, which users often
describe as allowing them to
break free from negativity and
intransigence.
The majority of participants
in the high-dose group
reported having “profoundly
meaningful and spiritual
experiences” during the
treatment session, which
relieved their despair and
caused them to re-evaluate life
and death, ultimately leading
to a lasting improvement in the
quality of their lives.
Research on the medical
utility of hallucinogens like
psilocybin actually began in
patients develop some form
of depression or anxiety,
which can in turn lead to
reduced treatment adherence,
prolonged hospitalization
and early death. Currently,
such syndromes are treated
with anti-depressants and/or
psychological approaches,
with limited efficacy.
Both US studies involved
the 1950s and by 1965, over
2000 papers had recorded
positive results for treating
patients with a range of
psychiatric disorders from
depression to addiction, with
no serious adverse effects.
However, as recreational
misuse increased among
hipster youths of the sixties
counter-culture, governments
across the globe issued a
moratorium on research,
eventually banning psilocybin
use altogether. Whilst in the
UK, psilocybin remains a
Class A illegal drug, the recent
waiving of prohibition laws for
medical studies has led to a
resurgence of scientific interest
over the past decade.
An estimated 40% of cancer
larger patient groups than
previous psilocybin trials (29
and 51 participants at NYU
and JHU respectively) and
used a randomized double-
blind placebo-controlled
approach – the “Gold
Standard” of intervention-
based studies. And the
findings are pretty conclusive
– the single psilocybin dose
led to an immediate reduction
in clinician-scored depression
and anxiety, with long-term
improvements in life meaning
andoptimismreportedby80%
of patients. The therapeutic
effect was closely tied with
the transcendent nature of
patients’ experiences.
Yet these results are not
dissimilar to those of earlier

studies by Professor Roland
Griffiths (who led the JHU
team) using healthy volunteers,
in which psilocybin induced
enduring positive changes
in life outlook and even
personality, suggesting that
psychedelic treatment could
be applicable to a variety of
disorders. Ongoing research
by Griffiths is analysing the
efficacy of psilocybin for
alleviating nicotine addiction,
whilst the therapeutic potential
of other psychedelics,
including MDMA and LSD, is
also under investigation.
The results from the two
groups were published with
no less than ten commentaries
from lead scientists in the fields
of psychiatry and palliative
care, who all heavily back
further research. “These
findings, the most profound
to date in the medical use
of psilocybin, indicate it
could be more effective at
treating serious psychiatric
diseases than traditional
pharmaceutical approaches,
and without having to take a
medication every day”, said
George Greer, director of
the Heffer Research Institute,
which funded the trials.
So might our archaic drug
policies finally undergo
an overhaul in the name

of scientific progress? It’s
unlikely. Despite the ever-
growing phenomenon of drug
misuse in modern society, both
the public and governments
remain suspicious of
psychedelic research. The
popular image of psychedelics
is tarnished not only by their
association with today’s ‘rave’
scene, but by a nefarious
past; classical hallucinogens
were studied historically by
the US military for use as
incapacitating agents, and
by the CIA as interrogation
devices. Furthermore, any
research exploring alternative
states of consciousness
faces opposition from within
psychiatry itself, with such
experiments often branded as
‘mysticism’.
Hence in order to move
forward, psychedelic research
must tread carefully. Although
hallucinogens are considered
non-addictive and relatively
safe physiologically, their
administration does involve
certain psychological
risks, and requires a highly
controlled clinical setting,
supervised by professional
observers. Whether the
significant time and cost of this
support is an investment that
our already strained NHS can
afford remains questionable.
But as the nation faces an
unprecedented epidemic
of mental illness and dire
shortcomings in available
treatments options, a
thorough and dispassionate
consideration of medical
psychedelics, uninfluenced by
social and political pressures,
may just be a public health
imperative.
