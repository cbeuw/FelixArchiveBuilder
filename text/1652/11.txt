20th Century Women – Released 10th Feburary
Elle – Released 10th March
From receiving a seven minute standing ovation at
Cannes and making the top films of 2016 list of a numer-
ous critics and film magazines, Elle is a film that caused
a huge impact in the festival circuit and is predicted to
do the same when released later this March. Following
a successful career orientated woman who after being
raped begins to suspect all the men in her life, who both
adore and resent her. Isabelle Huppert praised for her
role, being called ‘the best living actor’, plays a woman
who refuses to be the victim and instead uses her situation
to her advantage. Elle explores the mindset of a modern
independent woman and those that surround her – is
she someone to be hated and pitied, or someone to be
feared?
Following his late breakout film Beginners, a semi-auto-
biographical film that dealt with his father coming out as
gay in his mid-70s, Mike Mills returns for his long-awaited
follow-up, 20th
Century Women. Again, Mills turns to his
own life for inspiration, looking towards the strength of
his mother and sisters when he was growing up. The film
centres on Jamie (Lucas Jade Zimmerman), who is being
raised in 1970s California by single-mother Dorothea
(Annette Bening). Dorothea seeks out the help of Abbie
(Greta Gerwig), a young punk, and Julie (Elle Fanning),
one of Jamie’s peers, to help raise him right. 20th
Century
Women bills itself as ‘a collective portrait of the women
who became our mothers,’ and while some might balk at
such an epithet, Mills manages to remain on the right side
of sentimentality.

T2 Trainspotting – Released 27th January
Christine – Released 27th January
If you’ve seen Danny Boyle’s masterpiece Trainspotting
(1996), this is a no-brainer. If you haven’t then go watch
it. Trainspotting (1996) followed the lives of Mark (Ewan
McGregor) and his circle of drug addicts amidst the urban
poverty in Edinburgh. It showcased the life, culture and
the morals of the people living in that subculture. A highly
stylised film receiving widespread critical acclaim, it could
be said it was this film that catapulted Danny Boyle into
the main circles. T2 Trainspotting is the sequel to that sen-
sation. T2 follows Mark and his gang 20 years down the
line from the 1996 classic. After being left with promises
of living a ‘stable, traditional life’ from the former heroin
addict, the film is a ticking time bomb and it explodes later
this January.
Christine tells the harrowing story of Christine Chubbuck,
a Florida news anchor who killed herself live on air in
1974. Rebecca Hall takes on the titular character in a pow-
erhouse performance that mines the depths of Chubbuck’s
self-destructive tendencies; due to its release date, Chris-
tine missed out on eligibility for BAFTAs, but I’m hoping
that Hall’s performance is recognised by the American
Academy come Oscars season. Watching her Chubbuck is
like watching a volcano that’s about to erupt, with all the
feelings bubbling beneath the surface. Director Antonio
Campos perfectly creates the environs of sunny Florida,
which contrasts with Chubbuck’s increasing downward
spiral; he handles the sensitive material delicately, without
ever tipping over into exploitation. Christine is a profound,
sensitive exploration of the depths some people are driven
to by their mental health problems, painting a picture that
is fair and just, but never shies away from darker issues.

Silence
F
ollowing on from
the messy hedonism
of The Wolf of Wall
Street – a three
hour orgy of casual
violence, over-
sexualisation, and easy
profanity – it is clear that
Martin Scorsese is searching
for a kind of ‘mea culpa’ with
Silence, a mix of asceticism,
endurance, and proselytism.
It’s a hard pill to swallow.
Based on a Shusaku Endo
novel, Silence follows the
plight of two Portuguese
priests – Father Rodrigues
(Andrew Garfield) and
Father Garupe (a little-used
Adam Driver) – who journey
to Japan in search of their
mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam
Neeson).
Ferreira, as we learn at
the beginning of the film,
was made to endure brutal
tortures at the hands of the
Japanese, and has since (it is
rumoured) renounced God.
He performs this apostasy – a
word that recurs throughout
the film – by stepping on a
small image of Jesus; it’s a
miniscule but meaningful act,
and the Japanese converts
who refuse to do so are put to
death.
Garupe and Rodrigues are
accompanied to Japan by
Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka
– a highlight of the film), who
has already suffered physical
and psychological torture at
the hands of the government.
What follows is a three-hour
slog through the mountain
villages of Western Japan,
which progresses at such a
slow pace, it’s like wading
through a biblical flood of
treacle. This isn’t helped by
the bizarre decision to get
Driver and Garfield to put on
unplaceable, quasi-European
accents, which veer all over
the place, and make their
acting seem strained. For
Driver, the accent he puts on
is like a thick lacquer that is
nevertheless unable to hide
the inflections of his idiosyn-
cratic voice. For Garfield,
meanwhile, the accent is more
sure, but still off-putting, and
not helped by the constant
voiceovers he provides – for
a film called Silence, there
sure is a lot of unnecessary
talking going on.
The film is at its most
dynamic towards the last
hour, when Rodrigues Fred Fyles
(Garupe has since left the
scene) encounters his spar-
ring partner, the Inquisitor
(played brilliantly by Issey
Ogata), and they debate on
the reasons for the Christian
mission to Japan. It is in these
lucid, enlightening moments,
shot through with literary
imagery – Japan is a swamp,
the potential colonisers are
foreign, intrusive concubines
– that the near-monologue
Garfield is forced to recite is
revealed for what it truly is: a
collection of religious-sound-
ing platitudes, that ultimately
belie any real meaning.
Throughout Silence,
Scorsese documents with
increasing brutality the tor-
ture used against Christians:
from slowly dribbling scalding
water down their bare torsos,
to hanging them upside-
down, a slit in their neck
bleeding them drop by drop.
It seems Scorsese wished to
inflict similar violences on
his audience: Silence is an
over-wrought, un-nuanced
work of film, which more than
wears out its welcome. Pure
(cinematic) torture.
A strained, off-putting work \\ Paramount
S
torytellers are
a threat,” wrote
Chinua Achebe,
“they threaten
all champions of
control, usurpers
of the right-to-freedom of
the human spirit”. It is this
power, that of a simple story
well-told, that director J. A.
Bayona is trying to tap with
his latest feature A Monster
Calls, an adaptation of
Patrick Ness’ fantasy novel.
But the simplest of stories are
the ones the most difficult
to tell, and unfortunately –
despite a strong cast and
proficient visuals – A Monster
Calls fails to deliver.
The film centres around
Conor O’Malley (Lewis
MacDougall), a bullied
schoolboy whose mother
(Felicity Jones) is dying of
terminal cancer. During her
deterioration, Conor needs to
deal with both his estranged
father (Toby Kebbell), and
his domineering grandmother
(Sigourney Weaver). Luckily,
he has the help of a giant
tree-monster, voiced with
gravelly gravitas by Liam
Neeson, who tells Conor
stories that are more twisted
and knotty than those in a
traditional story-book. The
Monster creates a visually
stunning world – aided by
the art team behind Pan’s
Labyrinth – where princes are
not always good, and wicked
grandmothers can be acting
with pure intentions.
However, unlike Pan’s
Labyrinth, which was unafraid
of handling mature topics
with grace, A Monster Calls
by and large avoids tackling
the more difficult themes
that are so sorely needed
in coming-of-age films. A
parent with cancer might
seem like a grown-up enough
proposition, but there is never
any sense of menace or
danger in the film, making it
seem emotionally blunted. A
Monster Calls plays the same
sentimental note throughout,
at times teetering over into
mawkishness.
A Monster Calls is also
marked by a number of incon-
gruities in its reference points
and unevenness in tone.
With its perennial gloomy
weather and suburban
drear, Bayona is trying to hit
thematic targets that range
from British coming-of-age Fred Fyles
Storytelling without bite \\ YouTube/Focus Features
flicks to kitchen-sink drama,
but it adds up to an uncanny
environment. Compared
to the intricate pop-culture
layers contained in, say, the
Duffer Brothers’ Stranger
Things, A Monster Calls is
constantly missing the mark
in its portrayal of suburban
English youth in revolt.
There are stand-out parts of
the film: Sigourney Weaver is
brilliant as the brittle, distant
grandmother, trying desper-
ately to contain the pain of
a parent watching their child
die before their eyes; and
Lewis MacDougall is certainly
one to watch out for – his
Conor is able to ricochet
effortlessly and naturally
from happiness to despair
to rage. The watercolour
sequences – which appear
too infrequently – mine a rich
heritage of British cultural ico-
nography, and are gorgeous
indications of what the film
could have been. Ultimately,
while A Monster Calls may
contain an emotional punch,
it misses its mark too often,
leaving us with only a sense
of missed opportunity.
