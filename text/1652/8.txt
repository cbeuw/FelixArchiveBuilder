A
high-fibre
diet protects
against bowel
infection,
thanks to
bacteria that
normally live in the human
gut.
Remember mum and dad
harking on at you to each
your fruit and veg? Although
perhaps nothing more than
well-intentioned nagging at
the time, new research has
shed light on a novel scientific
reason for shovelling in that
daily fibre.
In an article recently pub-
lished in Cell, an international
team of researchers used a
mouse model to investigate
the impact of dietary fibre
deprivation on resident gut
microbes and the conse-
quences for the health of the
digestive system.
Their findings were a little
disconcerting. As it turns out,
when starving, our suddenly
not-so-friendly gut bacteria
feed instead on the natural
mucus layer lining the gut
wall, eroding it to the point
that pathogenic bacteria can
invade and instigate disease.
The intestinal mucus layer
forms a critical first line of
defence against infection by
potentially harmful microbes.
Mucus also serves as an
alternative nutrient source for
resident bacterial communi-
ties, which rely primarily on
dietary carbohydrates, espe-
cially fibre, for energy.
The modern diet of western
nations is inherently lacking in
fibre, a deficit which has been
linked to increased incidence
of inflammatory diseases
including asthma, allergies
and irritable bowel disease
(IBD).
The team of scientists led by
Eric Martens at the University
of Michigan Medical School,
together with his former
post-doctoral fellow Mahesh
Desai, developed a novel
mouse model which lacked
any microbes of its own, but
contained a transplanted
microbiota comprising 14
selected species of human
gut bacteria. Between them,
these species were capable of
producing ~1700 carbohy-
drate-digesting enzymes,
similar to the number secreted
by the 500 – 1000 species
contained in a typical human
gut.
It was found that when the
mice were subjected to a diet
regime which was deficient
in complex plant fibre,
the composition of the gut
microbiota shifted from con-
taining largely fibre-digesting
bacteria, to one abundant
in mucus-degrading species
– a trend that has also been
observed in IBD patients.
Notably, fluctuations
occurred extremely rapidly,
mirroring the daily alterna-
tions between fibre-rich and
fibre-free diets.
“The lesson we’re learning
from studying the interaction
of fibre, gut microbes and the
intestinal barrier system is that
if you don’t feed them, they
can eat you,” said Martens.
And indeed, as the number of
mucus-digesting gut bacteria
increased, thinning of the
mucus layer was seen in the
colons of fibre-starved mice.
Interestingly, when mice
were fed prebiotics – puri-
fied, soluble carbohydrates
commercially purported
to stimulate the growth of
‘friendly’ gut bacteria – the
same changes in microbiota
profile and mucus thickness
were observed as in mice on
the fibre-free diet. Let’s hope
buyers kept their receipts.
Colonisation of the human
gut by pathogenic bacte-
ria – for instance, E. coli,
a common culprit of food
poisoning – causes severe
diarrhoeal disease, amount-
ing to substantial health-care
costs. In order to access the
gut wall and exert pathogenic
effects, these bacteria must
first get through the gut mucus
layer.
Hence unsurprisingly, when
infected with C. rodentium,
the rodent equivalent of
human E. coli, mice on the
low-fibre regime were ~10-
fold more susceptible to
colonisation than those fed a
fibre-rich diet. This higher col-
onisation was accompanied
by severe inflammation of the
colon, with over half of the
mice losing at least 20% of
their original body weight.
Whilst the health benefits of
dietary fibre have long been
recognised, the mechanisms
linking fibre deficiency to
disease risk have, until now,
remained elusive.
The findings of Martens and
his team have underscored
how even subtle changes in
the balance of our resident
microbial species can strongly
influence host-microbiota
interactions and our vulner-
ability to diverse diseases.
These include not only enteric
infections but also metabolic
syndromes, inflammatory
conditions, cancer, and even
Parkinson’s disease.
Perhaps most alarming
about these findings is the
speed at which, with exter-
nally applied forces (e.g. diet
or antibiotics) we can unknow-
ingly effect major behavioural
alterations in our microbial
control hubs. And not always
for the better.
However, on the upside of
this, the malleability of our
gut residents opens the door
to new methods by which we
can manipulate the microbi-
ota to improve human health
and even treat disease. So
far, experimental microbio-
ta-orientated therapies have
centred on faecal microbiota
transplant (FMT; yep, it’s
what it says on the tin) – a
technique which involves con-
siderable procedural burden.
Future experiments by Mar-
tens and Desai will explore
the prospect of using dietary
therapeutics as a simpler
alternative to FMT. Until then,
should we follow the example
set by Blue Zones and move
towards a more plant-based
diet?
F
act: There is a
jellyfish that can
live forever.
Turritopsis dohr-
nii, a small blob
floating in the sea
off Japan, has been clas-
sified as the world’s only
immortal organism, since it
can develop to adulthood,
reproduce and then go
backwards in time to an
earlier stage in its life cycle
and start the whole process
again.
The trick up its sleeve is a
process called transdiffer-
entiation. When a human
cell becomes highly special-
ised (or ‘differentiated’), it
acquires useful properties
but cannot go back, nor
become any other type of
cell. For example, a skin
cell can’t change its mind
and decide to become a
stem cell or a heart cell.
However, the immortal jel-
lyfish has cells that are not
bound by this restriction, so
cells in the body of an old,
injured or stressed adult
can revert back to stem
cells. These stem cells can
then develop to produce
entirely new adults, effec-
tively allowing the jellyfish
to cheat death.
Call it regeneration rather
than transdifferentiation
and suddenly the idea of
Dr Who doesn’t seem so
far fetched.

Lizzie Riach summarises a talk in the Royal Society’s series ‘Science Matters’ on the direction of
where artificial intelligence is heading, and why there’s no need to be scared of it taking over
the world...yet.
L
ast Wednesday
I attended a talk
comprised of five
leading experts in
the fields of machine
learning and artificial
intelligence (AI), mediated
by the calming voice of Brian
Cox. It was an enlightening
evening. I hadn’t really
thought too much about AI,
but what struck me was how
much of what I did know was
based on fiction films. What
soon became apparent was
that, obviously, we were no
where near the likes of the
humanoid robot seen in Ex
Machina, a film for which
one of the panellists, Murray
Shahanan, was the scientific
advisor. I mean, sure, a
machine had beaten the
number one Go player in the
world, the last strategy game
where humans, until now,
could not be beaten. But this
specific machine was built
specifically for playing Go. It
had no other functions outside
the realm of game-play – it
certainly wasn’t going to take
over the world.
The first question was: what
exactly is the difference
between machine learning
and AI? The general
consensus was that machine
learning has a narrow
function within the spectrum
of AI. Machine learning is
when an algorithm is given to
a computer, allowing it to use
data to learn its own solutions.
This is becoming extremely
widespread, it’s used by
Facebook to tag photos
using facial recognition –
the more photos you tag of
a person, the more data the
algorithm gains to what this
person looks like. Similarly,
Siri uses voice recognition to
understand commands. These
algorithms decide what you
may like on Netflix or Spotify,
and you also may notice that
adverts on facebook tend
to be customised to your
likes, searches, and events.
In my case, UV rave make
diagnoses than humans. So
this is machine learning, a
fairly narrow part of AI, but
one that has garnered the
most attention in the past
few years. AI uses machine
learning, integrating it into a
more general framework to
become ‘intelligent’ by doing
‘the right thing at the right
moment’ in an ever-changing
world.
But how do we keep track
of what exactly AI is learning
or doing? Even the experts
confessed that a lot of the
time, the most complex and
powerful computers used
for machine learning give
them next to no information
on how they are doing it.
This is because within their
‘black boxes’, inspired by the
neural networks of our own
brains, the algorithms get too
complex to process. However,
the scientists reiterated that
the very architecture of
these machines limit them to
undertake the tasks given to
them.
So what about the future?
Predictions all pointed to
machine learning becoming
extremely widespread, being
present behind the scenes,
especially in healthcare to
helping diagnose and treat
patients, as well as public
services – looking at houses
mostatriskoffireoryouthsmost
at risk from abuse. Self-driving
cars will be everywhere,
and buildings designed by
machines to utilise minimal
cost for maximum strength
will prove extremely helpful
to engineers and architects.
Crime patterns, financial
predictions, pharmaceutical
drug synthesis, and genetic
fingerprinting could all be
aided by AI. Speech interface
between humans and devices
will be more equipped for
handling complex speech
and questions. “So which
jobs are ‘tech-proof’?” a
up ads haunt my newsfeed –
perhaps a hint that I should
stop clicking ‘attending’ to RA
events, and actually get on
with my Masters. The point is,
machine learning is constantly
becoming an integrated
way to advertise, as well as
becoming a basic interface
for people and devices. The
Amazon Echo and Alexa
Voice service were among the
biggest Christmas bestsellers,
due to their voice recognition
technology.
This can also be employed
in healthcare. Identifying a
cancer cell is one example. A
machine, at first, could scan
an image of healthy cells and
cancer cells. With no data
on either, the machine would
simply guess which one is
cancerous. After a doctor
verifies which one is which,
this data will be logged.
Thousands of choices later,
the machine will have found
patterns based on why certain
cells look cancerous, and in
time may make more concise

concerned audience member
asked. Speakers stressed that
although some jobs may be
made redundant when AI
takes over, for others, it will
be there to do menial boring
jobs, giving us more time to
do the fun and creative ones.
Jobs that are the ‘most safe’
were apparently those that
retain the need for manual
dexterity, such as a plumber
or electrician, care-givers, as
well as those in the creative or
entertainment sectors.
Our very own Director of the
Aerial Robotics Laboratory,
Dr. Mirko Kovac, graced the
stage at this point to talk about
where drone technology
could be heading in the future.
He stated that using drones
for photography and delivery
were obvious applications,
and that we should be thinking
more creatively about their
wider uses. His bio-inspired
ideas centred around the
‘Build Drone’, which can attach

itself to pillars by building
‘webs’ when they’re running
out of power to fly. Once
attached, they can recharge
and sense its surrounding
environment, similar to spiders
waiting for prey in their webs.
By drawing inspiration from
animal behaviours, Dr. Kovac
and his laboratory have found
a way to allow their drones to
act autonomously.
This talk cleared up my
own unfounded prejudices
against AI, and opened up
the possibilities it may hold
in the future. Despite my
amazement though, I couldn’t
help but feel AI may begin
to know our habits and living
patterns better than we do.
Who will have access to this
information? The biggest
global tech companies are
only going to grow in power
with this technology, I just hope
it’s in a positive direction.
