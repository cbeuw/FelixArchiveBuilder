ondon is rarely without a performance of Hamlet on
one its stages. Almeida’s staging features Andrew
Scott (of Moriarty fame) in his first performance
in the role. Director Robert Icke is known for his
startling updates on classic works. His last work at
the Almeida was Chekov’s Uncle Vanya whose star,
Jessica Findlay Brown, returns in his Hamlet as Ophelia. Icke’s plays skewer audience perceptions
and expectations and challenge them to consider seminal works of literature as starkly modern and
relevant commentaries. When he staged 1984 at the Almeida in 2014 in our modern world of constant
surveillance a few years ago, a couple of audience members fainted during the torture scenes,
though the stage was dark and nothing was shown. In an interview with The Financial Times earlier
last year, he spoke of what compels him to reinvent classics to inject them with such vital and present
energy, in Hamlet Icke wants to ask “to sit there in 1599 and watch this play that speaks directly to
your anxiety: what does that feel like?”

t’s safe to say that 2016 wasn’t kind to the world of culture. In a year of blow after blow to the pantheon of
iconic cultural stars, the passing of two more bright lights – Carrie Fisher and her mother Debbie Reynolds
– left the arts world reeling once more. 2017 brings with it a new hope that we’ve left the curse of the past
year behind us – at least in the world of art, dance, and theatre (the political climate of course is quite
another matter). A brand new year means brand new shows and exhibitions to look forward to; in less than
a week the first tickets for Hamilton will be put on sale, just as the cast of Lin Manuel Miranda’s other great
musical In the Heights take their final bows in the West End. Hamilton will land in London in October, but before
that there’s lots, lots more to get excited about, here are our 3 top picks for this term...

here’s no shortage of the female form
in art, from medieval Maddonas to
Renaissance goddesses, to Anish
Kapoor's Queen’s vagina on the
ground of the Versailles, but in these
works womanhood is filtered through
the lens of the male gaze. In the art world,
women are often portrayed as no more than
male fantasies, as Margaret Atwood writes in
The Robber Bride, the experience of navigating
this world can be a discombobulating
experience: “you are a woman with a man
inside watching a woman. You are your own
voyeur.” In their haunting collage piece Do
Women Have to Be Naked to Get into the Met.
Museum the Guerrilla Girls state that whilst
85% of the nudes in the modern art section in
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
are female, only 5% are by female artists. This
new exhibition staged by the Whitechapel
Gallery and The National Museum of Women
in the Arts in Washington is an all-female show
exploring womanhood through the mediums of
video and photography. The 17 contemporary
artists featured include Marina Abhramovic,
Anna Gaskell, and Rineke Dijkstra. Their work
will present the 'female body as a vital medium
for storytelling, expressing identity and
reflecting individual and collective experience'.

single trip to any of the ballet productions being staged in London every day can
make it abundantly clear how great the lack of diversity is in the ballet world. Why
this should be so has its roots in economic inequality, lack of representation and the
ever-present spectre of entrenched racism. In March, the Barbican will be hosting
Ballet Black, a small company for international dancers of black and Asian descent for
the second time. Since its founding in 2001, the troupe has been critically acclaimed,
winning the 2012 Critics' Circle National Dance Award for Best Independent Company. Led by artistic
director Cassa Pancho, the classically trained troupe have been roundly lauded for their virtuoso
performances of original choreography. Their second Barbican show will once again be a triple bill
of original performances each with a different choreographer. Martin Lawrance and Michael Corder
will create edgy, abstract performances to sumptuous orchestral music, while in the third, South
Bank Sky Arts Award-winner Annabelle Lopez Ochoa adapts Little Red Riding Hood as a surprising,
chilling, feminist ballet.
