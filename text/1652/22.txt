CANCER
VIRGO
This week you’re
back once again.
You’re the renegade
master.
LEO
PISCES
AQUARIUS
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO
LIBRA
GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week you
leant on a wall in the
Science Museum and
suddenly all these
sirens went off and
everyone left in a
hurry. How strange.
This week exams go
poorly. In the grand
scheme of things it
doesn’t matter though,
nothing does.
This week you’re
The Queen and you
weren’t seen in public
for two weeks over
Christmas. She’s not
dead, she’s just doing
January exams.
This week you
discover a new found
hobby, urinating on
Donald Trump. Not in
a sexual way though,
it’s purely out of
malice.
This week you’re
a new you, it being
a new year and all.
Unfortunately the
new you didn’t get a
new ID card so the
examiners throw you
out of the exam room
for cheating.
This week you go to
the reopening of fabric.
Unfortunately Citymapper
didn’t understand your
drunken commands and
you end up in a lovely little
upholstery shop in Zone 7.
You take some drugs and
have a fantastic time all
the same.
This week you join the
‘No Pants Tube Ride’
in London but you turn
up on the wrong day.
Nobody bats an eyelid
though. Probably
because you were clad
in ICURFC gear.
This year you’re
2017. You’re a prime
number. Hopefully that
means you’ll be less
divisive than 2016.
This week you realise
that writing news is
easy, the trick is to just
lie.
This week you’re late
to a tutorial because
of the tube strike. But
you weren’t were you.
You overslept. In Beit.
Naughty.
This week exams go
fantastically well. In
the grand scheme of
things it doesn’t matter
though, nothing does.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I need some help with my new year’s resolutions. See I
normally don’t make any – I don’t consider myself a sheep,
mindlessly adopting trends for no good reason. But this year I
thought I’d give resolving a shot. And boy did I.
I promised myself I’d workout every day, start eating more
fibre (that was a request from my colon) and study real hard
for my January exams. I said I’d walk my dog twice a day,
quit porn and do some recreational reading every night
before bed. I could go on for hours but what would be the
point? All resolutions have already been BROKEN! Well
with the exception of quitting porn, but that’s solely due to a
government ban on my favourite genres.
Chris help me. How do I make successful resolutions?
Yours,
AP Nouya
Dear Nouya
I’m really sorry that 2017 has already sucked
so hard for you, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t
see your complete and utter failure coming. I
mean you know it’s amateur hour when some-
one promises they’ll “work out every day”.
Lesson number one. When making a resolu-
tion, be as vague as possible and avoid at all
costs to specify time frame and magnitude. I
said I’d work out in 2017. On January 2nd
I did
a push up. Boom. Success.
But you don’t even need to try to keep your
resolutions if you’re tactical. For example, this
year I promised myself I’d get sick less! But I
don’t really have an option because I can’t
HOROSCOPES
afford private healthcare and the NHS is in
shambles! So it’s either that or probably death
in a corridor in a Worcestershire Hospital.
Finally, for a 100% success rate just keep your
resolutions to yourself. Because no one can
call you out on the mess you call a life if they
don’t know you tried to change. And let’s be
honest, no one wants to know your lame-ass
resolutions unless it’s something like achieving
world peace or cloning Hitler.
Hope that helps!
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
