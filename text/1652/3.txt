t’s that time of year again
when final year students
across the country
are invited to fill in the
National Student Survey
(NSS), also known as
Imperial’s bane of existence.
Last year’s remarkably low
student satisfaction scores saw
Imperial dropping in ranking
from number ten to 21 out of
24 Russell Group universities.
Whereas in the past this
hasn’t been a priority issue
for Imperial, the NSS has
now become a fundamental
part of the newly introduced
Teaching Excellence
Framework (TEF) and could
affect tuition fee rates and the
number of overseas students
allowed. The introduction of

and using it to dramatically
reshape the university
landscape across England,
with unknown economic and
social impacts,” she writes.
The NUS will be
coordinating a nationwide
boycott of the NSS. Vieru’s
appeal encourages students
to stay strong and resist
selling out. “Don’t allow your
feedback to be used against
you, don’t fill in the NSS. Not
for a free coffee, not for an
Amazon voucher, not even
for a crack at a free iPad.
“By boycotting, students
will use the NSS for its true
purpose – to show that we
are incredibly dissatisfied.
Not necessarily with our
courses or the university,
but with the government and
its attempts to dishonestly
suggest it cares about the
quality of our teaching, when
really it’s just trying to raise
fees again.”
the framework is supposed
to “ensure all students
receive an excellent teaching
experience that encourages
original thinking” according
to Minister for Universities
and Science Jo Johnson.
However it has been widely
criticised and even despite
amendments last November,
concernsremain.AsProfessor
Stephen Curry told felix
earlier last year “ [TEF] still
risks becoming burdensome
and too heavily driven by
metrics which (as we all
know) do a very poor job of
capturing or characterising
educational quality, which is
the thing that students, staff
and government all ought to
be working together on.”
TEF also remains unpopular
with the National Union of
Students (NUS). Earlier last
year a national education
demo took place demanding
“no ifs, not buts, no education
cuts”. In a recent article
for the Guardian, Sorana
Vieru, vice-president higher
education for the NUS denied
any value to the NSS when
it comes down to improving
quality of teaching.
“TEF is a tool by which
to raise tuition fees, taking
a poorly thought through
approximation of teaching

Firefighters swarm the Science Museum
Lef Apostolakis
J
ust before noon
last Wedensday,
hundreds of visitors
were evacuated
from the Science
Museum. As the
visitors collected outside the
museum on Exhibition Road,
three firefighter squads arrived
and created a perimeter
around the historical building,
amounting to a total of seven
fire engines with aerial support
from a helicopter.
The firefighters were
responding to an automatic
fire alarm that had somehow
been triggered.
While the firefighters
entered the museum looking
for the source of the sus-
pected fire, Museum staff
entertained children with
games, to prevent the young
explorers’ investigative day
from losing momentum.
Some children were led to
the neighbouring Latter Day
Saints Church to keep them
warm.
Imperial College students
appeared mesmerised by the
red shiny fire engines.
When it was verified that
there was no fire, only an
alarm malfunction, Imperial
College security opened the
Falmouth Gate onto Queen’s
Gate to help the firefighter
squads get out. The gate is
only supposed to be opened
for the Queen.
This is already the second
time in 2017 that Exhibi-
tion Road gets packed
with swarms of evacuated
museum-goers. About a week
earlier, visitors had to be
evacuated due to a bomb
threat directed at the neigh-
bouring Victoria and Albert
museum. The threat turned
out to be a hoax.
That awkward moment something exciting happens at Imperial \\ felix
