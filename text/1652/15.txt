Sherlock

Sherlock’s always hotly
anticipated new years debut
proved disapointing this year.
A lukewarm mytery made
for boring watching. So why
couldn’t TV’s darling detective
find his footing this year?
A
fter last year’s
somewhat
disappointing
bait and switch,
Sherlock has
finally returned
with a full season this holiday
period. The Six Thatchers
picks up immediately where
we left off at the end of
the previous episode, with
the government leaping
into action over Moriarty’s
seeming return. The episode,
however, quickly distances
itself from this plot line, as if
the writers had realised that
they’d backed themselves
into a corner by needing to
constantly raise the stakes.
We start with a helpful mon-
tage showing the passage of
time that quickly establishes
one of the recurring themes of
this episode; padding. John
and Mary become parents,
and Sherlock continues
solving cases while waiting
for Moriarty to play his hand.
Thankfully, this parade of
banality is brought to an end
relatively quickly, as the main
case of the episode quickly
catches our protagonist’s
attention.
Now, credit where credit is
due, all the performances are
excellent as ever, and Cum-
berbatch and Freeman fall
into familiar grooves comfort-
ably. However, this introduces
some issues of its own. Per-
haps I’m just fatigued, but the
charm of Sherlock’s quirks is
fading, and seeing the same
gags rinsed repeatedly grates
slightly. It seems as if the
characters have reached the
peak of their development,
and the only way the writers
seem to have of shaking
things up is resorting to cheap
tricks and the reset button. It’s
a real shame, since there was
potential for really introduc-
ing a new dynamic by making
Watson a father. However, it
seems to go nowhere in this
episode.
The episode is overly action
heavy, and feels like an
attempt at a made-for-TV
Jason Bourne movie. The
action sequences are egre-
gious and, again, frequently
feel like padding. The worst
offender here is the frustrat-
ingly long sequence of Mary
hopping around the world.
Not much actually happens,
plot-wise, through the course
of the episode.
Fortunately, the humour
is largely well executed
in this episode. There’s a
dearth of jokes that got
a laugh out of me, and
the occasional extended
moments of self-awareness
and lamp-shading are much
appreciated bouts of levity.
The dialogue, however, is not
always at its best and drags
down the episode at points.
And what of the central
mystery? Unfortunately, the
mystery itself isn’t that inter-
esting, and major event that it
sets up is just poorly thought
out. Firstly, the amount of con-
trivances and coincidences
stretches suspension of disbe-
lief, even for an episode of
Sherlock.
The misunderstanding at
the core of the plot is obvious
to see through, and it seems
suspect that someone as close
to Mary as the episode sug-
gests would think she was the
traitor based on a throwaway
sentence. Additionally, while
the final solution to the mys-
tery is satisfactory, the lack
of time spent developing
the perpetrator’s
character
means
that
it is
\\ Credit where
credit is due, all the
performances are
excellent as ever \\
Black is everyone’s colour \\ BBC
nowhere near as cathartic as
it should be.
Finally, Mary’s death comes
completely out of nowhere,
and does not feel at all
earned. It makes for a poor
surprise, since there is no fore-
shadowing or build-up, and
squanders perfectly good
storytelling opportunities.

have allowed the creators to
explore a lot of territory that

At the very least, it was
smart of creators Moffat and
Gatiss to avoid blowing the
Moriarty load straight away
on this episode. It would have
left little room for the stories
to heat up as the series went
on, and would have neces-
sitated increasingly absurd
plots to keep audiences
interested. This episode, while
not a complete disaster, was
quite disappointing. While it
leaves a bad taste in the view-
ers mouth, I am hopeful that it
won’t be representative of the
whole series.
