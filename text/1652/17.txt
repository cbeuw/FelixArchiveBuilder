Breakfast, Hong Kong style
felix takes a brief trip to Hong Kong
for an artery-clogging breakfast -
best scrambled eggs, creamy white
bread and gip milk tea
some specks of ‘black truffle’
garnished on top. I was so
hungry by then, I grabbed
my dripping wet knife and
fork off the damp napkin and
dug in. Yes, I paid the extra
£2 for the non-existent black
truffle (the black specks were
just burnt carbon bits), but
the scrambled eggs were the
best I’ve ever had. Creamy,
velvety-smooth yet light – the
cheap, spongy white bread
soaking up the golden river of
deliciousness. I washed down
each and every mouthful with
milk tea – smooth and just the
right amount of gip (a Can-
tonese word for bitterness).
As I headed towards the
forever pissed-off-looking
lady at the till by the door, my
P
lonk.
It was the sound
of a quarter-inch
thick china cup
hitting the glass-
topped wooden
table, as my milk tea lands
before me just three seconds
after the waiter took my
order.
My mind snapped out from
my fuzzy morning daydream
of fluffy bunnies jumping
over lush green grass back
into full awareness of the
reality. It was brunch time on
a muggy Tuesday morning,
but with a slight change of
scene from the usual relaxed
cafes in Shoreditch – I was
sitting alone, next to strangers
in a small, cramped room
lit by bright, yellow lights.
An oversized, gold piece
of calligraphy, a gift from
a celebrity, was proudly
displayed on one retro-look-
ing, black-and-white tiled
wall. Customers slurped their
noodles, gulped down their
tea, occasionally glancing up
from their phones. Two wait-
ers rushed around the tables,
wiping down the tables after
each customer, replacing
the used cutlery with freshly
washed ones, shouting
orders to the sweating chefs
in the open kitchen behind,
dumping plates of breakfast
food on tables and chatting in
full-blown Cantonese. I was in
Capital Café, a local café on
a busy street in Hong Kong.
To be more specific, this
café is a typical Cha-Chaan-
Teng – a Hong Kong-style
café. With that said, you
can now ditch the stereotyp-
ical ideas of what a ‘café’
should be. Here, there is no
overpriced coffee served in
branded paper cups. Here,
there is no good-looking
baristas with suspected
dyslexia. Here, there is no
free Wi-Fi and no comforta-
ble sofas with music blasting
in the background. A Cha-
Chaan-Teng is the place to
fill your stomach with quick,
affordable, truly Hong Kong-
ese food. It is the place you’d
go to when you finish work
late at night, for an early
morning breakfast or an
afternoon tea at 15:15. It is
the place where you eat sur-
rounded by noise, and expect
to be kicked out as soon as
you’ve finished your meal. It is
the place where you witness a
food culture that has formed
through many years under
British rule, a tradition that
has survived through many
generations, a well-loved
cuisine that answers the true
needs, tastes and lifestyle of
working class Hong Kong-ese
people.
Let’s be frank. As a Hong
Kong-ese raised by (slightly)
of laminated sheets of paper
tucked underneath the glass
table-tops, was no excep-
tion. Breakfast: macaroni
in soup with artificial ham,
toast with peanut butter and
condensed milk. No dim sum,
by the way. Lunch: spam
sandwich, spaghetti with
barbeque pork. Afternoon
tea: Deep fried French toast
(a must-have Hong Kong-ese
classic) drenched in golden
syrup topped with a big
slab of butter, finished off
with a good cup of milk tea
(extra-strong black tea with
evaporated milk, an all-time
favourite). No one cares
about five-a-day, arteries or
heart disease when you can
get a filling meal for under 40
HKD (£4).
Plonk.
The black truffle scrambled
eggs on toast on a flowery
plate was dumped in front of
me just like the others. This
was what I came here for –
an old-school café keeping
up with the latest black-truf-
fle-in-everything trend. The
mountain of bright yellow
scrambled eggs wobbled
and shook on the inch-thick
piece of white toast, with
Christy Lam
health-conscious parents,
I’ve ever only entered a
Cha-Chaan-Teng three times
in 21 years. Why? Because
the menu would be shock
horror to any nutritionist.
Fruit and vegetables do not
make an appearance, except
for a slice of tomato or a
cabbage leaf in a sandwich.
The menu here, in the form
mind came clear of a truth. I
needn’t the best sourdough,
fancy French butter with a
Clarence Court egg; it was
the cheap bread, the most
horrible service you could
ever imagine in a rowdy
environment for a taste of
the authentic, delicious local
breakfast, and reunited my
taste buds with my roots.

Basic food for basic students (you’re basic)
F
or many of us, it’s
revision week time!
Yay!! Can you feel
the enthusiasm? I
can feel it all around
campus – especially
in the library late at night or
when I see some girl crying
in the bathroom; I’m not
saying that men do not cry in
the bathroom, but I for one
cannot see them – the perks
of using the ‘ladies room’.
But enough about
depressing subjects! Or
happy ones assuming
you’ve been waiting for
this time of year to show
everyone just how smart
you are (Good for you). As
you might know by now,
this is a food article and,
hence, I am going to talk
about food (duh!). Mostly
about easy to make recipes
that will allow you to spend
a lot of time revising – and
we all know that by this I
mean learning stuff for the
first time.
French cuisine at its finest
Pancakes! Maybe not
the healthiest food in the
world or the easiest to
cook, but they give me the
boost of happiness I need
to continue my day; espe-
cially if they are Nutella
and banana pancakes. Just
don’t think about Ameri-
can pancakes. Here we’ll
talk about the French kind
– crepes.
Beat the eggs in a bowl,
big enough to be able to
hold all the ingredients.
Add the sugar and a touch
of salt. If you feel like
experimenting, get rid of
the sugar and add a bit
opposite might happen and
the pancakes might be too
runny. In this case, they will
take forever to cook – you
might not even be able to
flip them. If this is the case,
just add a bit more flour.
The final step has come,
now that you have the
perfect batter. Just pour
some of the mixture in a
preheated pan with a bit of
oil in it if you’re not using a
non-stick pan. You can try
and flip them in the air – I
mean, what loss is a crepe
or two!
When you are done,
stuff them with anything
you want. You might try
my favourite combination
– and by my I mean, every-
one’s favourite combination
– of Nutella, banana,
strawberries and cream.
When I am really desper-
ate for some sugar I even
add some maple syrup.
(Yes, you can judge me and
yes, probably I’ll discover
that I have diabetes in a
couple of years). Or you
can just come up with your
own combination.
Congratulations, you are
a French chef now that you
know how to make crepes!
Healthy mind in a healthy
body – keep lying to
yourself!
This is just a simple salad,
for those of you who just
want to feel healthy from
time to time... Or all the
time. It will work if you are
on a diet, too – but really
now, who can be dieting
and revising at the same
time? For me, this is the
best 15 minute recipe that
can work for either lunch or
dinner or both, depending
on how much I make.
I really believe that you
have enough imagination
to know what to do with all
these ingredients in order
to get a salad – unless you
have a howtobasic Youtube
channel and you think you
can eat the same things you
upload. If this is indeed the
more salt. This way, you
will bring out the contrast-
ing flavours, assuming
their pairing with excessive
amounts of Nutella. Just be
careful not to add too much
– the seasoning of food is
an art I cannot teach you;
you must learn it yourself
through trial and error.
To the mixture, add half
of the milk and stir until
it becomes homogenous.
Slowly, start adding the
flour and continue stirring.
Add the rest of the milk
until you get a smooth
mixture, liquid enough to
be able to pour it easily.
Depending on the flour
you’ve picked, you might
need to add some more
milk. If you are not sure
about this, just try cooking
a small pancake and taste
it; you will know if it feels
right or not – hopefully,
it will! Be aware that the
case, you definitely need
my guidance. Or anyone’s
guidenace for that matter.
Hard-boil the eggs (8-10
minutes). While they are
boiling, cut the chicken
breast in stripes (or cubes,
or spheres or amino acids
– maybe this way you’ll
finally remember them) and
fry it in a preheated pan –
if it’s a non-stick pan, don’t
forget to add a tiny bit of
oil.
Cut the tomatoes and the
cucumber. Chop the spring
onion(s). You might also
want to chop your salad
leaves if they are of the
large variety. Add them in
a bowl with the corn. Add
the fried chicken breast.
Peel the eggs and cut
them into bite-size pieces.
Cut the cheese in 2x2x2 cm
cubes (if they are 2.01 cm,
you’ve ruined the whole
thing).
Add everything to the
bowl. Mix a bit – you can
feel civilised and use a fork
or you can go wild and use
your hands. Add salt and
pepper to taste. My secret
ingredient in a salad is a
bit of sugar – just a tiny
tiny bit. Don’t tell anyone!
You can use it.
In the end, add some
Greek yoghurt. As
much as you like – or
don’t. I honestly cannot
congratulate you for man-
aging not to ruin a salad,
but I will once you share
your very own recipe with
me.
Go nuts for the nuts (with
chocolate)
I might have a problem
with sweets. And when
it’s revision week, it gets
worse. I can eat a whole
chocolate bar in one go.
I mean it! I am a choco-
late monster when I have
to learn something. Or, if
I don’t have chocolate, any-
thing with enough sugar.
And I am not even 100%
sure that it’s scientifically
proven that sugar helps
learning – but my mom told
me that when I was a little
girl and I, as a good girl,
must listen to my mom’s
advice. And you should
listen to mine and eat as
much chocolate as you can
– at least you won’t feel
bad about it now. Just tell
yourself that it helps you
go through those boring
soil lectures (I’m assuming
that’s all you geologists
learn about).
But if you plan to increase
your chocolate intake, at
least do it in style! Or be
like me, and just wolf it
down, you decide.
