Animal rights group protest Imperial’s
receipt of animal research award
Cruelty Free International aren’t buying it
Abigail de Bruin
not 24-hour checks, there
seems to be no particular
fault in this area for College
beyond a poorly worded
report in 2014.
Certainly, though there’s
a strong sentiment that
24 hour care would be
the kindest way to treat
the animals vital to our
research, we don’t seem
to have an actual legal
requirement to do so.
Perhaps then it would be
more effective for efforts of
animal rights groups such as
Cruelty Free International,
to focus on lobbying the
Home Office to update its
legislation so all Animal
Research Institutes have to
follow better guidelines.
J
ust before the end
of last term we ran
an article about the
fact that Imperial
College had been
awarded for Public
Engagement Activity in the
annual ‘Openness on Animal
Research Awards’. In response
we were contacted by Cruelty
Free International and given a
press release from the animal
rights group.
It’s worth noting here that
the British Union for the
Abolition of Vivisection that
published the controversial
undercover investigation in
April 2013 merged with its
sister organization Cruelty
Free International in March
of last year, taking on their
name and branding.
Cruelty Free International
have responded to the news
of the report but stating that
“it is deeply ironic that the
College has been given an
award for openness – by
the main pro-vivisection
lobby group – when it
recently fought Cruelty Free
International tooth and nail
not to disclose how many
hours care staff are on
duty.”
This comes back to the
Imperial Animal Research
Annual Report from
2014, which Cruelty Free
International challenged
for the reference to ‘round
the clock’ or ‘24/7’ care.
The actual quote from the
Report states “In addition to
world-class facilities, we are
also committed to providing
round the clock care for all
our animals, with at least
one veterinarian and five
senior animal care staff on
call 24/7”, says Mandy
Thorpe, Director of Central
Biomedical Services (CBS).
“We also monitor the
animals’ environment night
and day, and if conditions
fall outside of the Home
Office Code of Practice, we
will be notified by text and
email alerts.”
The Cruelty Free
International response to the
award continues “We now
know – after the College lost
our case at the Information
Tribunal – that care staff
are on duty only from 8am
to 5pm, considerably less
on weekends and public
holidays. This is despite
the highly invasive surgical
procedures routinely
carried out by researchers,
such as induced heart
attacks and double kidney
transplants”. It should be
noted that the challenged
report states that research
staff at Imperial “also have
a long-standing practice
not to carry out surgery on
Fridays, weekends, bank
holidays or College closure
days.”
So, whilst the Cruelty Free
International has indeed
established that there are

The issues included a dirty

“This was a huge
achievement for the two of us

problems and liaises with
College to get things done”
However, whether the
refurbishment will be long
lasting is uncertain as there are
plans to move the Chaplaincy

Whether this move will include

remains unknown.

Cox and Rachel Blythe after
they were approached by

struggling to get issues with

over seven years.
Finally, towards the end
of last term plans for the
refurbishment were finalised
and the works were set to take
place over the holidays.
“We worked with College
