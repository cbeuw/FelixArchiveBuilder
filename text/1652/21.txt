fter such an
amazing 2016 full
of brown people
being sent back
home, borders
being closed,
and righteous leaders with good
business sense being elected, I
can’t really imagine a situation
where things could get any
better. I am as much of a stickler
for traditions like new year’s
resolutions as I am for marriage
to be between a man and a
woman, and just like marriage as
God intended it to be, none of my
resolutions have anything to do
with homosexuals.
As it is a new year, I have
decided that I will take up a
new hobby; however, I am
indecisive as to which hobby I
should take up. First of all there
is hunting. While On the one
hand I love the idea of killing
creatures that are weaker than
me, on the other hand having
to pay a licence and letting the
government known what kind
of weapons I possess doesn’t sit
well with me. Another hobby I
have been considering is one
that I‘d taken up in my youth
and I’m sure I must still have the
outfit in my attic somewhere. I
just don’t know, if I still have the
energy for all that cross burning
and lynching. The fact that there
will be a much larger intake of
members soon due to the fact
that being openly racist is now
a presidential characteristic is
also discouraging – I bet that
some of them won’t even remem-
ber Rosa Parks and how she
ruined buses for everyone.
Another resolution I made was
to become a more respectable
and likeable person in that
new-age holistic way. I guess if
I start to model myself more on
President Trump then perhaps I
can start to feel more in touch
with the youth of today. First
step will be to make a disa-
bled friend who I can make fun
of – my guess is if people see
me making fun of tards they
will accept me into the fold. I
think in regards to my attitude
towards women I am perhaps
a little too soft – if I can train
my one to stop answering back
then that will hopefully elevate
people’s opinions of me. All in
all, we have no idea as to what
this new year holds for all of
us, but as long as it involves the
imprisonment of transexuals and
liberal crooks, it’s gonna be a
good one.
I
hope you all had a relaxing,
environmentally friendly
christmas, filled with as many
carbon neutral gifts as there
are genders. 2016 was, as
many of you known, the death
of progressive politics and free
thought, so as a result of entering
the new year I have decided to
indulge in the ancient tradition of
declaring “new year, new me!”.
Of course I am a vegan (just in
case you didn’t already know)
and hence I am already morally
pure and perfect; however,
even perfection has room for
improvement. My new year’s
resolutions are threefold: 1) To get
more in touch with my common
man/woman/gender neutral thing
2) To become far closer to nature
and 3) To be more patient with
other people.
Many writers into this weekly
column have told me that many
of my views are ‘elitist’ and
‘privileged’ although frankly
that sounds like something a
poor person would say. With
that said, however, I am not
afraid to change (unlike the
numerous gender normative
toilets across the campuses of
Imperial), and indeed I have
decided that I will indulge in
the activities of the lower, less
eco-friendly members of our
society. At least once a week I
will attempt to drink a lager that
is not made from organic hops;
I shall attend one organised
sports parade a month although
I feel as though I shall have to
call in advance to ask what their
vegan meal choices provided
for the intermission are.
In order to become even closer
to nature and life than I already
am, I have decided to start
sleeping with a pig. Of course it
will be completely platonic, but
if things start to happen… well
the heart wants what the heart
wants. Furthermore, how much
closer to nature can you get
than literally inside an animal?
Pigs have been found to be
able to experience pleasure as
well and of course it would be
consensual.
Thirdly I must of course be
more patient with those not on
an exclusively dairy-free-quinoa
only diet. When people try to
tell me that there are only two
genders, I will take a deep
breath and then try to find a
constructive way to tell their
cis-pig selves that they have
obviously missed out at least six
others. When people try to tell
me that fat people are endan-
gering themselves and are a
burden on the health service, I
will tell them to shut their skin-
ny-bitch-over-privileged mouth
and that they should recognise
that all shapes are beautiful.
Even the ones that cause coro-
nary heart disease. 2017 looks
to be an awful year but who
knows? Perhaps Hillary did get
more votes than Trump and will
actually get to be president.
New year’s resolutions
are hard to come
up with when you’re
perfect

your ignorant , fat-shaming ass
even though you don’t deserve it
2017 seems full of
promise after the
great year that
2016 was
