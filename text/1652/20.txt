How Memebridge reignited the
university meme scene
T
his strange world
of memes which
we currently find
ourselves in – one
where a president
can be catapulted
to the White House with the
help of online fascists and
Pepe the Frog – is terrifying.
There was an undercurrent of
darkness in the memes that
defined 2016: we celebrated
Harambe’s death as if he
were a messiah, exposed our
inner self through evil Kermit,
and philosophised over the
trolley problem. It wouldn’t be
until the end of the year that
the dankness would finally
return.
What started as a simple
meme page in Cambridge
(Memebridge) has quickly
exploded into a national
ecosystem of university meme
pages each with thousands of
followers. University memes
are by no means a new
phenomenon (the original
Imperial Memes page has
nearly 5000 likes) but this
new crop of pages has
succeeded in a different way,
thriving on interuniversity
rivalry and collaboration.
This rivalry was the catalyst
for the growth of the univer-
sity meme scene. Soon after
Memebridge was created
a group of Oxford students
started their own page,
Oxmeme. The long-term
success of memes has always
come down to the way in
which they are reused and
replicated. So naturally it
wasn’t long before Oxmeme
decided to steal Meme-
bridge’s memes, a deadly sin
in the online community. The
war had begun.
As if one page wasn’t
enough, a second page was
born from the English-speak-
ing world’s oldest university:
The Memeing Spires of
Oxford. As more and more
rival pages appeared, the
variety of Memebridge’s
memes grew. Durhameme
proved the perfect target with
their attempt at introducing
“Doxbridge” to the national
lexicon, resulting in a number
of humiliating ‘roasts.’ Thou-
sands were liking and tagging
their friends in the varsity
meme wars but nothing had
prepared them for what
would come next.
On the 14th
of December,
Memebridge (“Sent by
Alfred”) shared a video
which would shake the
university meme world to its
core. Poking fun at Memeing
Spires, Oxmeme and Dur-
hameme, “the bane video”
set the bar for what a meme
page could do and is essen-
tial viewing for any university
meme connoisseur.
In the same week, a whole
new frontier of the university
the
Likes
UCL is no where to be seen \\ Cale Tilford
That can only meme one thing \\ Sent by James
meme conflict emerged. At
least half a dozen new pages
were created: Memeches-
ter, Birmemeham, Memes
College London (King’s),
Exememe, Royal Memeoway,
and of course, our favourite,
Memeperial. While each of
these pages has their own
set of admins and running
jokes, they all share a dislike
of Oxmeme for no particular
reason.
Memeperial currently has
over 4000 likes, nearly 300
more than felix’s own Face-
book page, and it’s gained
that in a much shorter time.
Writing for Cambridge’s
Varsity, Elizabeth Howcroft
discussed whether Meme-
bridge had become the new
student voice of Cambridge,
a place where students
could freely share their
feelings of existential dread
that reappear during every
exam period. Memeperial is
similar to other pages in that
it focuses on what makes life
at Imperial bad; the dreaded
‘Imperial ratio’ is one of many
recurring themes. The page
is good at poking fun of the
more trivial things that make
our life at Imperial miserable
and maybe that’s enough
to qualify as the voice of
Imperial students. felix, which
so many of us hold in high
esteem, could certainly do
more to make students feel
like they are part of a com-
munity of students who share
the same struggles. Despite
Memeperial’s success, it is
unlikely to sustain itself in the
long-term. You only have to
look at Imperial Memes and
Imperial College Secrets, two
pages which now lie dormant,
to see that meme pages can
be short lived. We can only
hope that Memeperial and
the rest of the new pages on
the meme scene don’t suffer
the same fate.

Wars
A
s a year,
2016 really
pissed me off.
I remember
when 2008
ended. I
remember people saying
that it would be consigned
to history as the year of the
Great Recession. My call is
that 2016 will be seen as the
year of the fuck-up. The future
looks uncertain and shaky.
No one planned for political
tragedy and who knows
when deaths of refugees on
the Mediterranean, of Syrians
in their homes and terrorist
bombings will end. Last year
the world saw a profound
change.
This was accompanied
by a generational shift
that has seen the concept
of the Millennial placed
centre stage. But do most
of us fully grasp what
this involves? I don’t think
so, so I’m going to make
a stab at describing the
fundamental differences
between the lives of a
60’s kid and a 90’s kid.
Why is this important?
2017 needs to be spent
fixing this bloody mess,
and if we make use of
the character traits that
set us apart from past
generations, we can get
somewhere better. Also,
we need to understand the
broader picture of societal
change. Answering the
question ‘What makes
young people in general
pro-EU?’ is important in
understanding how to
clean up the turd 2016 left
behind on the living room
floor.
We need to acknowl-
edge the fact that our
life attitude, drive and
aims are distinctly dif-
ferent from those of our
parents. Many of us were
brought up in an envi-
ronment where we were
told that we could do
whatever we wanted with
our lives, where avenues
of opportunity opened
up to us. How different
that is from my Italian
grandparents, who stayed
near the villages they
were born in, used to visit
the same beach nearly
every Summer on holiday.
Nowadays, we are taught
to take advantage of our
individual freedom in such
a way that all of these
things become a personal
choice. The world is your
oyster, and you can travel
and find jobs wherever
you fancy. Also, you are
not compelled to stick
with the religion of your
heritage.
Young Millennials
will therefore make life
choices in a new way,
motivated by a different
combination of factors
than their predecessors.
In 2010, Pew Research
Centre found that of eights
choices presented to US
18-29 year-olds, the third
most important priority
in their lives was to help
others in need. Having a
high-paying career only
came sixth. So there does
appear to be a consen-
sus that young people
strive towards a life with
purpose, in which self-ful-
filment is achieved by
making a positive impact
rather than by pecuniary
reward.
In my opinion, the
growth of secularism in
society has forced us to
reassess our place in the
universe. Faith prescribes
meaning to people’s lives.
It tells you how to be good
in the eyes of something
higher. Without it, we
must decide our role in the
world for ourselves. There
is less emphasis in our
lives in working towards
pleasing God and more on
living either for ourselves
or for the good of our
community, whether it is
local or global.
The job market has
responded to our chang-
ing view of the world.
Many of our parents will
have worked for the same
company for as many as
40 years. When they were
applying for jobs, it was
seen as risky to employ
someone who had done
many different things for
short amounts of time
because they were more
likely to leave and move
elsewhere. Now we care
less for the stability of a
long-term job. It is now
normal to spend several
years in different jobs,
then leave to follow a pas-
sion. The modern thinking
sees this favourably since
you have accumulated
a variety of experience
and have seen things from
more than one perspec-
tive. In fact, it is harder
to gain a promotion
within your own company
because recruiters will
search outside for the best
talent, and it becomes
more appealing to go else-
where to work.
It is apparent that we
see our own personal
development as more val-
uable than loyalty to an
organisation. This gives us
the drive to do something
that can selflessly take the
world forward – perhaps
contributing to renewable
energies or organisational
transparency. As nations
have become more pros-
perous, new technologies,
in particular the internet,
have been developed
and put at the disposal of
Millennials who want to
do great things with them.
However, there are times
when personal gain is pri-
oritised above the greater
good, as can be seen
by Buzzfeed’s reports of
teenagers from the Former
Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia making money
by creating fake news
supporting Trump.
My hope is that our lot
will one day repair the
mess left by the year of
the fuck-up. This cohort
is more well-educated,
tolerant and open to dif-
ferent perspectives – even
though Brexit might seem
like a vote for change,
it was actually led by
nostalgia and a resistance
to modernity. As we grow
older and Millennials
become more dominant, I
see a future where post-
truth politics will wilt.
