The NHS is in a
humanitarian
crisis
Stephen Naulles discusses the
government’s inability to recognise
the current crisis at the NHS.
could raise an additional £5bn
in revenue; reversing the cut in
corporation tax could raise an
additional £1.5bn. Neither of
these are particularly radical
suggestions if they result in a
health service that is properly
staffed and resourced.
The bulk of this funding should
be used to increase in-patient
capacity, address staffing
shortages, and bolster the
social care system to reduce
unnecessary or avoidable
admissions. The Conservatives
are wrong to use spin about
weekend mortality rates – we
should seek to improve out-
comes over the entire week,
acknowledging the concerns of
junior doctors earlier this year.
We have a Prime Minister
and Health Secretary going on
national television to debate
the semantics of whether the
NHS is in a ‘humanitarian
crisis’, or just your regular run-
of-the-mill crisis. Instead of
focussing on their image they
should sack the spin-doctors,
and work with the real doctors
to make sure there is no crisis to
debate in the first place.
T
he Society of Acute Medicine
has revealed that the NHS
currently has “third world levels
of staffing and third world levels
of beds”. For the Red Cross,
our NHS is in the midst of a
‘humanitarian crisis’. This language may
sound vitriolic, but a crisis of this magnitude
is something medical professionals have
been warning politicians about for years.
Over the weekend, 42 A&Es had to
divert patients to other hospitals due to
their inability to deal with the number of
patients coming in. Many of those that
actually made it into the hospitals were left
on beds in corridors, a damning indictment
of the sheer lack of capacity in our NHS at
the moment.
Indeed, there has been a 212% increase
in the number of patients waiting more
than 4 hours to be treated, and A&E
attendances over the last ten years have
increased from 16.5M to 21.8M. We con-
stantly hear about the mounting challenge
posed by an ageing population. Surely
then it follows that we will have boosted
our ability to cope with these additional
pressures? Evidently not. Acute in-patient
capacity is being reduced in many trusts
as part of the government’s sustainability
and transformation plans; an elaborate
cost-cutting exercise which places meeting
financial targets in the name of ‘efficiency
savings’ over patient safety. The Kings Fund
estimates that NHS providers and commis-
sioners ended 2015/16 with a £1.85 billion
financial deficit. All of this coming from a
government claiming to have learned from
the mistakes of Mid-Staffs and vowing to
never put financial obligations before
patient safety.
The answer to the crisis lies in progres-
sive taxation reform, not budgetary cuts.
Despite us now being the world’s 6th
biggest
economy (thanks Brexit), we spend just over
8% of GDP on healthcare. The IFS estimates
that a 1% increase in the rate of income tax

ne of my 2017 felix-
related resolutions was
to diversify my activist
feelings away from
the environment. Not
that I’m bored about
talking about it – not at all. Every week
there seems to be some lab somewhere
making breakthroughs on green energies,
new legislation about restricting urban
transport, or an international agreement to
reduce our carbon emissions. And if that’s
not the case, there’s always Trump sharing
his insightful thoughts about how we’re all
making this greenhouse gas stuff up after
all. Anyway the point was that there’s a
thousand other causes that are also worth
protesting weekly about, but Lef asked me
to write about climate change, so blame
him.
This week in climate change news we
have a giant iceberg, the size of Trinidad
and Tobago, threatening to break off from
the Antarctic ice shelf, which could lead to
a global ocean rise of 10 cm. Big iceberg
or not, temperature and sea level rises have
been reported for the past few decades,
with human activity being deemed directly
responsible (sorry Trump, there’s evidence).
If you’re reading this, you’re proba-
bly thinking either (a) “I know this, and
I don’t care- some UN people will make
sure everything is alright and Venice won’t
become Atlantis any time soon” or (b) “I
know this, and I do things in my power to
fight it (recycle/buy one of those reusa-
ble coffee cups/am vegetarian, etc...)”. I
personally proudly sat in the library this
afternoon researching decarbonisation of
UK electricity sources for my coursework
and thinking to myself how nice it feels to
be in category (b).
And then for a second, the paradox struck
me that while we’re all here happily dream-
ing about a fossil-free world, Imperial, with
its world leading leaders in renewable
energies, cutting edge clean technology
labs and environmentally
mindful individuals, is invest-
ing over 4 million pounds of its
endowment directly in oil, coal
and gas. Indeed, while leading
universities worldwide, from
Stanford to Glasgow, have
managed to almost entirely
divest from fossil fuels, Impe-
rial is currently ranked 96th
on
the People and Planet 2016
University League, reflecting
its lack of involvement in envi-
ronmental issues. UCL is 29th,
just saying.
I’ve tried to understand the
logic behind this, but even after
talking to Imperial’s Energy
Manager about the issue, I
am convinced that nobody
cares how much coal we burn
to power our green technol-
ogy research labs – such is
the currency of a degree from
Imperial. I feel like not only
should we care, but demand
an ethical investment policy
from our institution and thank-
fully, there’s a great bunch
of people called Fossil Free
Imperial who do just that. So
spare a few seconds of busy
student life to check out their
Facebook page and sign their
petition. Island-sized icebergs
are breaking off after all.
Decolonising
philosophy?
SOAS, get real!

decolonisation,philosophy, and special

S
o The Telegraph
reported that the
SOAS’s Student
Union wants
the university to
decolonise its
philosophy to remove Plato,
Descartes and Kant. I read
it just after having a pint
of ale at Eastside to forget
the tragedy that was my

face redder than the time I
confessed my feelings to that
girl two years ago – (She
very politely rejected me). You
may ask me, “But didn’t you
decolonise your life and go to
China to be a farmer?” Let’s
just say that my mum found out
and beat some sense into me.

So back on topic: SOAS
SU said that the majority
of philosophers they learn
about should be African and
Asian, and the university
should address the “legacy
of colonialism”. Now I was
about to go on that whole
rigmarole of decolonising
my life all over again, but it
just made me angry. Angry
about the state of our gen-
eration and how our culture
had gone so horribly wrong.
To clarify my views on
colonialism, it was indeed
horrid, fuelled by greed
and patronising ideas of
ethnic superiority, leading
to massive death and suf-
fering; however, history has
always been about death
and suffering, with Euro-
pean colonialism merely
the latest and most indus-
trialised form of it. I don’t
see these people lament-
ing the massive destruction
following the Mongol inva-
sions, the Mughal invasion
of India, and the fact that
African slavery was carried
out by indigenous Afri-
can tribes decimating their
enemies. Colonialism was
also not a zero-sum game
of the white man oppress-
ing the natives. It was an
interchange between the
rich and powerful elites on
both sides collaborating to
benefit themselves, while
the vast majority of people
were simply trying to sur-
vive. Colonialism also led
to massive benefits for the
colonised in some cases.
In my case, schools set up
by Christian missionar-
ies in Malaysia educated
my parents (and an entire
impoverished Chinese and
Indians fleeing poverty, war,
and discrimination.
On the point of knowledge
and education, people have
always learnt from each
other. Witness how the
muslim Arabs preserved the
valuable knowledge and
teachings of the Greeks,
how Southeast Asian cul-
tures developed under
the Indian Hindu/Buddhist
cultural sphere and how
Europe learnt from the
Ancient Romans, Greeks,
Chinese and Arabs to kick
start the Renaissance. SOAS
students may have a point
about under-representa-
tion of African and Asian
philosophy, but Plato, Des-
cartes, and Kant are part
and parcel of humanity’s
intellectual heritage and to
demand their removal from
the syllabus is stupid and
beside the point.

tant and valuable. The fact

remains that European
civilisation has had and
continues to have an outsize
impact on modern society,
and to understand the world
we live in, we have to learn
about it. Education is about
creating a well-rounded,
open-minded individual
who can think critically. This
arrangement is not going
to create that. Instead the
SOAS Student Union simply
wants to create racist, nar-
row-minded, brainwashed,

Unfortunately this feeds
into a wider ‘snowflake’ soci-
ety where freedom of speech
and now even freedom to
learn are being curtailed in
order not to ‘offend’ people,
and where the boundary of
what is ‘offensive’ grows
day after day.We are also
seeing how censorship is
being pushed in under our
noses in the guise of political
correctness, to control what
we can see, read, and think.
No. I shan’t and won’t let
these stupid people define
me and my generation, the
most educated, tolerant,
and well-off in history.
To summarise, even if
their claims of African and
Asian philosophy being
under-represented is valid,
banning white philosophers
is a stupid and ignorant
thing to do, especially in a
university in the UK, which
incidentally is part of Europe
and has developed under its
cultural sphere. The SOAS
Student Union is belabour-
ing a moot point and making
fools of themselves and our
generation, because even if
they are snowflakes, most
young people aren’t. These
people epitomise the hate,
bigotry, ignorance, and
racism which they claim to
fight. You may say that we
have to tolerate or accept
those views, but tolerance
of intolerance is cowardice,
and will ultimately erode
the freedoms and rights we
cherish. The SOAS Student
Union should focus their
energies on relevant issues,
not this load of rubbish.
