I
t turns out Ryan Gosling
is as roguishly charming
and wonderful in person
as we all hoped he would
be. I was lucky enough
to see La La Land for
the first time at a London
Film Festival screening,
after which he appeared to
a hurricane of cheers and
thrown roses/knickers for a
Q&A. When asked about
dance number, and several
extended analyses of the
joys of jazz, for Christ’s sake,
releasing a movie like this
in 2016 certainly must have
taken some guts – or, rather
more likely, a hell of a lot of
heart.
It tells the story of Mia
(Emma Stone), Sebastian
(Gosling) and – well, actu-
ally, nobody else. Minor
players from the two Los
Angeles-based dreamers’
separate lives may flicker into
appearance for a brief spell,
but La La Land is very much
The Stone & Gosling Show.
Thank god then, that what we
have here is a pair of the best
performances either of these
actors have ever given, and
that their chemistry has never
been stronger than it is in this
film – it appears their crush-
ingly lifeless work in 2013’s
Gangster Squad was only a
fluke. When they are working
in tandem, whether in conver-
sation, song, or movement,
they click so tightly that you
wonder if you’re watching
two real humans or two
beautiful clockwork con-
traptions. They’re strikingly
reminiscent of some of the
great old-time silver screen
couples like Ginger Rogers
& Fred Astaire. And yet they
excel individually too: Ryan
Gosling brings every Ryan
Gosling-ism in the book to his
performance, and yet you
always believe that the man
you are watching is indeed
jazz enthusiast Seb Wilder
when a song is not necessary,
it does not appear; some of
the story’s most crucial points
take place in a spoken scene,
not in song, but are certainly
no less powerful for it. There
is a scene in which a quiet
dinner descends into an argu-
ment which, as well as being
a frontrunner for the film’s
best moment, is in all honesty
one of the best-written and
best-acted scenes I have ever
watched in a musical, onstage
or onscreen; Chazelle proves
that he has not let his razor-
sharp skill for dialogue that
he displayed in Whiplash be
blunted by the grander aims
of this project.
The immense, upbeat dance
number that opens the film
is something of a fake-out;
while I suppose it’s very
much necessary to prepare
the audience for the fact that
what they’re about to watch is
a musical, the film that follows
is so much more layered and
intelligent than you expect
following such a full-throttled
show-tune (the song’s lyrics
perfectly fit the themes of the
film, but we only learn that
after we have seen it play
out). La La Land is not just
for lovers of musicals, but for
lovers of movies. It tackles
with elegance, eloquence,
and bold honesty the act of
chasing a dream, whether
that dream be acting or
opening a jazz club, and the
sacrifices that must be made
to achieve it. After watch-
ing it, I left the theatre both
heartbroken and blissfully
happy. Chazelle reportedly
says that it took six years of
people saying “no” to him to
get La La Land into produc-
tion. Seeing the completed
version of his film, the fruit of
his perseverance, must have
been worth every second of
the wait.

The highly aticipated modern day
musical which draws inspiration
from the old classics is as amazing
as the hype has made it out to be.
(not least thanks to a strong
grasp of jazz piano stylings
and a startling baritone-bass
singing voice, both of which
he appears to have pulled
out of thin air). But of the two
stars, Stone shines the bright-
est. As we watch her struggle
through failed audition after
failed audition, and make
coffee after coffee just to get
by, her every action, every
facial expression, every note
carried by her beautiful ear-
nest voice is an utter charm to
behold, and she is deserving
of every award that will
undoubtedly be flung her way
this year.
While Stone and Gosling
prove proficient as musical
theatre performers, their
strength as actors is what is
relied on most in La La Land.
This feels very much inten-
tional. One of the strongest
aspects of this film is that
director Chazelle understands
what made classic Hollywood
musicals so great; not an
endless barraged of forced
show-tunes (there are only 7
pieces that are sung by the
cast in the film, and one of
them is a reprise), but perfect-
ly-timed transitions into that
heightened version of reality
that only a musical can con-
jure, signifying those moments
in which, as Chazelle put
it, “everything just comes
together”. These are moments
like a playfully flirty conversa-
tion on a hilltop overlooking
Hollywood that becomes a
tap-danced duet, a poignant

the challenges he had faced
singing and dancing for the
film, he cracked that the real
challenge was having his
director Damien Chazelle
constantly walking around
the set in baggy old-timey
gangster trousers, clown
shoes, and an oversized
monocle that he insisted
on wearing. What. A.
Dreamboat.
At the same Q&A, Cha-
zelle (who also wrote the
film) recounted the time he
mentioned to his producer
– before beginning the
process of making his 2014
feature Whiplash – that he
had always had the dream
of filming a love letter to the
golden years of Hollywood
in the form of an original
romantic musical. It’s not hard
to believe that a vivid expres-
sion of alarm came over
the producer’s face, or that
the reply Chazelle received
was “that’s just about every
taboo word you can say to a
producer”; you can tell when
you watch La La Land that it’s
a miracle you’re watching it
at all. With lengthily played-
out fantasy sequences, a tap
