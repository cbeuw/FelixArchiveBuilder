O
ne of my friends recently pointed
out I’m going through a quarter-
life crisis, that we (our group of
friends) all are. And I can see
where he’s coming from. We’re all
in our mid-twenties and we seem
to permanently be at a crossroads. Transcending
from adolescence into adulthood (it’s… a process) –
changing, adapting, compromising.
The other day I had a moment. I was sat in my living
room, going over 2017 with my housemate Clive when
I brought up climate change. I started talking about
this thing I’d read in the news, the Larson C ice shelf.
A 5,000 sq km wide, 300 m thick piece of ice getting
ready to break off from Antarctica and become an
iceberg; an event that might raise global sea levels by
ten centimetres.
“Shit man, it’s happening” said Clive. To which I
nonchalantly spat back something along the lines of:
“I don’t even care anymore. We’ll be dead by the time
this planet becomes inhospitable”
There was a pause and I added: “I can’t believe I just
said that”.
I was gonna clean up the plastic from our oceans.
Holly would find a cure for cancer, Theo would
create a new anarcho-cryptocurrency, Mischa would
eradicate malaria and Josh would become a rockstar.
But now we’re all sat around a table, eating our
gourmet burgers, with sides of whatever the latest
vegetable trend is and we talk about how the world is
fucked. How we all feel the flight rather than the fight
instinct kicking in.
And maybe it’s understandable to feel this way right
now. The past year has been one bitch of a year.
And maybe you’re muttering “Wake up hun – you’re
not a unique snowflake. You can’t change the world”.
But fuck that. Cause the world doesn’t need me to
change. The world changes regardless of what I will
or will not think and do. Just look at 2016.
Yes, there was a lot of death and destruction. But if
you look up, you’ll see a second moon now orbiting
the Earth, a newly discovered prime number, and
gravitational waves. You’ll see that tiger numbers
rose for the first time in over a century. You’ll see that
Austria didn’t allow rightwing populism to take hold
quite yet.
So what if we’re not unique snowflakes capable
of changing the world? Some will be lucky and
determined enough to do so. The least the rest of us
can do is keep our head up, and root for them.
