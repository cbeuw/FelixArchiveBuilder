N
ews flash; Jeremy Corbyn
emerged from his ferret
hole in North London and
made a speech! He must
have read my article about
how he needed to get his
act together and talk positively about
immigration. As if I were felix’s de facto
Labour immigration policy correspondent,
I have returned to give a judgement on
JC’s words.
The summary is that despite wanting to
remain in the single market, Corbyn is not
opposed to ending freedom of movement,
which he has claimed Labour “is not
wedded to”. Somehow he has taken on
lack of enthusiasm as a political stance.
He has compromised on his positivity
towards immigrants in order to appeal
to working class voters who showed their
dissatisfaction with the status quo at the
ballot box last year. The result is a point
of view that is not particularly exciting –
much like his arguments for remaining in
the EU last June – but he seems to think
that the anti-establishment overtones will
invigorate the people. This remains to be
seen.
He also pointed out the things about
the EU that he hopes Brexit will consign
to the past – for example, state aid laws
that stop us helping the steel sector – but
we always knew he was not keen on the
European project. It is good he is still
talking about making changes in Labour
laws, in particular taking action against
undercutting of pay and conditions, as
that is a more constructive approach to
eliminating immigration problems than
closing borders.
It’s rather novel for immigration to be hot
on the lips of Labour politicians. MPs Emma
Reynolds and Stephen Kinnock were in
the news suggesting the introduction of
a two-tier immigration system, in which
highly skilled workers would be treated
differently to low-skilled workers. This

n recent months, the ‘Rhodes Must
Fall’ campaign has gained significant
traction not only at Oriel college,
Oxford but at several institutions in
the UK and abroad. The campaign
has attempted to have the statue of
Cecil Rhodes removed due to his strong
support for the apartheid movement in
South Africa.
The campaign has had already had
an impact at universities, with Queen
Mary’s University, London having recently
removed a foundation stone laid down by
King Leopold II, a Belgian king associated
with colonialism and the forced labour
and death of many people in what is now
the modern day Democratic Republic
of the Congo. Many of those who have
joined the campaign have not only riled
against the statue of Cecil Rhodes as an
individual who supported apartheid but
against colonialism, imperialism and their
historical influences on British education.
The views of Cecil Rhodes are of course
abhorrent and would find no home in a
modern civilized country but the issue of
whether it is right to remove his statue is
a very different prospect altogether. The
removal of his statue would be an attempt
to re-write history and ameliorate those
parts that make us uncomfortable.
But this is not what we should learn
from history and the mistakes we have
made; we should be able to look on the

past honestly and learn its
lessons whether these reflect
negatively on us or not.
We wouldn’t dare con-
sider removing statues of
Gandhi for all the great
work he did in liberating
India and bringing about
her freedom because of
his views on sexual assault
and women’s rights. Many
historical figures have had
views which run counter
to modern day values and
these statues stand as a
testament of how far we
have come as a society
and how far we must go
further to live in a truly just
and equal society. It does
these figures an injustice
to judge them by 21st
cen-
tury ideals and disregard
the context in which their
views were formed. Impe-
rial College has a long
and rich history, some of
which is based in Imperial-
ism. Our motto “Scientific
knowledge, the crowning
glory and the safeguard
of the empire” and one of
our aims “exploring and
developing the raw materi-
als of the Empire countries”
highlight these links but it
would be wholly inappro-
priate to attempt to change
our motto as it is a part of
Imperial’s history and is
crucial to the story of how
our university became what
it is today.

in the Evening Standard, which
sounded quite off the wall,

Jeremy Corbyn has been
leader of the party for over
a year, and only now has he
come up with a strategy. Well,
better late than never. It seems
like a reaction to the threat
posed to him by Paul Nuttall,
new leader of UKIP, who has
his eyes on Labour’s Northern
and Midlands heartlands. If
his tenure kicks Corbyn into
action, maybe it will be a
good thing for all of us.

T
here were train
strikes this week,
you might have
heard. No, not the
tube strikes, they
happen like once a
year; you can take a bus for
a day, get over yourself, no
one cares. I’m talking about
Southern Rail, whose staff are
on strike for three days this
week, causing a genuine total
shutdown of all services. strike since December, and
the conductors have been
striking periodically, meaning
that even when the trains are
running, they’re subject to
huge delays, cancellations,
and general unreliability.
Although the strikes can
hardly take all the blame for
this: Southern were failing to
provide the trains that they
promised long before the staff
stopped showing up to work.
Due to my general state of
poverty as a past-the-end-
of-funding PhD student, I’m
currently living in Croydon.
It should take me an hour
to get to college, not much
worse than living in Wood-
ward, so not a problem.
But of course, this assumes
that Southern do their jobs.
Last week, when there were
no strikes, I spent a total of
eighteen hours commuting
over four days. Five hours
a day travelling – and by
that I mean largely waiting
at freezing cold stations for
a train that won’t be can-
celled at the last minute – is
exhausting, and a waste of
my time.
There are alternatives,
sure. It should still be
possible to get into London,
it might take a little longer.
Which is fine, in principle,
but in practice the additional
pressure on alternative ser-
vices such as trams and
tubes is so great that the
stations offering these shut
down completely as a safety
precaution. I could take five
buses, taking around four
hours if it goes smoothly,
then have to immediately
turn around and start back
home as soon as I get into
college. These aren’t sustain-
able options.
I understand why the staff
are striking. I don’t really
blame them, it’s shit for them
too. I’ve read enough think-
pieces in the Guardian, I
know that they’re miserable,
and it’s all for our safety, and
they’re being forced to work
outside their contracts and
aren’t being compensated.

300,000 people, including

runs to the south of London,

only travel links into central

management structure, who
couldn’t organise a piss up
in a brewery, let alone the
timely passage of hundreds
of thousands of people, or,
if that’s too much to expect,
at the very least update the
expected arrival times at
the stations. They say that
they’re losing money, and
can’t afford to employ the
number of staff that they
need to maintain their time-
table. They say that being a
train company means run-
ning at a loss. Well tell that
to every other rail company
operating on National Rail
tracks, coming in and out of
National Rail managed sta-
tions. They’re all managing
to keep trains running and
turn a profit – maybe ask
them for advice.
Or if you’re really running
at that much of an unsus-
tainable loss, give it up
and hand back over to the
government so then at least
someone accountable is in
charge.
But enough is enough. This
is not public sector. South-
ern is a private company
and there comes a point
where it is not acceptable
to inconvenience such a vast
number of people because
they do not like the condi-
tions of their job. Of course,
Southern, in releasing a
timetable and taking gov-
ernment transport grants,
has a responsibility to its
passengers, particularly the
ones who spend a fortune
on season tickets. As much

needs to get its act together

to provide the service it
promises, or else hand over
the reins to Sadiq Khan or
someone who’ll do the job
properly. Or me, even. I’m
certainly more competent
and my main experience is
playing Railroad Tycoon.
I hate Southern Rail as a
company much more than I
resent the staff that work for
them on the ground. They’re
taking so much abuse from
angry delayed passen-
gers every single day, and
they’re taking it with better
humour than they could pos-
sibly be asked to. Certainly
these strikes have brought
out a sense of community
amongst fellow sufferers,
and we all like the excuse to
write sassy tweets. But we’re
bored now. The torture that
commuters are facing is
completely disproportionate
to the point that the unions
are trying to make, and the
damage that this mess is
causing to the economy is
obscene.
