T h i s year the student p o p u l a t i o n
of I . C . is expected to be 3,650 ac-
c o r d i n g to the p r o v i s i o n a l figures
given to F E L I X b y the D e p u t y R e -
gistrar, M r . E . H o l l i n g s . O f these,
2,150 w i l l be undergraduates a n d
1,500 postgraduate students.
T h i s year's undergraduate fresheT
intake is slightly higher t h a n last
year, w i t h 801 places filled a n d
about 17 u n f i l l e d places this year, as
opposed to 800 available last year
w i t h about 22 of these unfilled. T h i s
y e a r there w e r e also 594 postgraduate
freshmen.
It is surprising that a great m a n y of
the unfilled places represented a p -
plicants w h o d i d not appear to have
b o t h e r e d to reply to the Registrar's
letters a n d confirm their acceptance
of the place offered t h e m .
T h i s figure are, o n l y approximate
as this is a very busy time of year
for the R e g i s t r y a n d some students
were still b e i n g chased for registrat-
ion forms w h e n these figures were
given.
