Southside
A g a i n
Residents of Southside are re-
quested to complete forms issued
by Mr. P . J . Hills, sub-warden of
Falmouth Hall. These forms re
late to the car-parking facilities
available to residents. The park-
ing in this are has been under
control of the ^.S. Car Parking
Committee since last year.
In the S p r i n g .session, p a r k i n g i n
the road outside the Southside H a l l s
h a d got out of control. C a r s p a r k i n g
on both sides of the road h a d m a d e
it impossible for vans d e l i v e r i n g to
S.S. to turn. S o m e (British R a i l w a y s
a n d British R o a d Services) refused to
deliver. A p a r t f r o m this, i n the event
of a Are, the F i r e D e p a r t m e n t , fully
w i t h i n their rights, w o u l d have h a d
to " s h u n t " the cars on the side near-
est the H a l l s .
T h e Rectorial or C o l l e g e P a r k i n g
C o m m i t t e e decided that p a r k i n g
should be restricted to the N o r t h
side of the road. T o this e n d they
erected rather unsightly scaffolding
o n the South side to discourage
w o u l d - b e offenders. T h i s was fine for
F i r e E n g i n e s , but a taxi hit the scaf-
f o l d i n g and was a c o m p l e t e w r i t e -
off. T h e scaffolding, although u g l y
was very effective.
T h e S.S. C a r P a r k i n g C o m m i t t e e
was revived to face the f o l l o w i n g
problems :
(a) H o w c o u l d S.S. residents retain
exclusive use of the c a r - p a r k .
(b) H o w c o u l d p a r k i n g be restrict-
ed to one side of the road only.
T h e committee, consisting of a
representative f r o m each of the
H a l l s , d e c i d e d that the p a r k i n g on
the N o r t h side of the road s h o u l d be
d i a g o n a l l y i n c l i n e d , a n d that p a r k i n g
on d i e S o u t h side be restricted b y
means of d o u b l e w h i t e lines. T h e
car-park w o u l d be for the use of
residents or registered guests only.
B y Easter v e h i c l e registration was
complete, a n d the painters were c a l -
l e d i n .
T h e resulting markings discouraged
any dangerous p a r k i n g . A car c o u l d
not be p a r k e d w h e r e other vehicles
m i g h t bit it. Provisions w e r e also
m a d e tor motor-cycles.
Traffic wardens
T h e n e w committee has not yet
been f o r m e d this year, a n d so M r .
P . J . H i l l s sent out the registration
forms. 25 p a r k i n g places have been
lost to the builders d u r i n g the c o n -
struction of N e w H a l l , leaving 40
places. T h e reason no m o r e w e r e
lost was that S . S . P . C . stepped in a n d
the contractors decided to use the
East Side c u l - d e sac to deliver
materials.
15 vehicles, either a b a n d o n e d or
b e l o n g i n g to non-residents, were re-
m o v e d f r o m the car-park d u r i n g the
S u m m e r . T h e whereabouts of the
derelicts are not k n o w n .
It is to be n o f k d that the road a n d
car-park are b o t h C o l l e g e property,
a n d at any time the C o l l e g e c o u l d
w i t h d r a w facilities. T h e committee
p r o b a b l y p r e v e n t e d this. T h e W a r d -
ens c o m e r o u n d to ensure that only
cars w i t h I . C . stickers use the park,
a n d the C o m m i t t e e see that only
S.S. residents use the places, ( w h i c h
are on a fre-for-all basis, w i t h no
reserved places)
