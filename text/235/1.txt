Apologises
A sell-out but a failure'. That
was the verdict on this year's Fresh-
ers' H o p , h e l d o n the first Saturday
of the year.
T h e H o p h a d seemed a certain
winner, w i t h three g o o d groups a p -

one i n the L o w e r L o u n g e a n d o n e

of u p to £1500). F o r this lavish p r o -
duction t h e I . C . E n t e r t a i n m e n t s C o m -
mittee received permission f r o m
U n i o n C o u n c i l to raise the ticket p r i c e

too sold out. E n t r y to the H o p was

to p l a y i n t h e U p p e r Refectory. T h u s ,
instead of over eight h u n d r e d people

they c r a m m e d themselves into t w o ,
a n d the notorious 'sweaty cattldinark-

H o p s soon reappeared. A l t h o u g h later

the absent group ( ' M r . H i p ' ) w a s t o

antly relieve t h e pressure. ,
E n t s . C o m m i t t e e later issued t h e
f o l l o w i n g statement to F E L I X : —
" I . C . Entertainments Committee
apologises that n o group was playing
in the Upper Refectory and for the
resulting overcrowding of the other
two rooms. One of the booked groups
failed to.turn up and this was beyond
the Committee's control"

Sennet a g e n t s

" T h e y told me nothing," said pert
blonde Barbara Hedge, I . C . U L U
agent. The University newspaper
S E N N E T , which failed t o appear
around I . C . on Tuesday of last week
had been delivered to the Messeng-
ers' Office in Beit Q u a d at 4.30 a.m.
that day, without any arrangements
having been made for its reception.
It remained untouched until noon on
Wednesday, when F E L I X enquired of
Miss Hedge why S E N N E T was not
available.
M i s s H e d g e explained that she h a d
b e e n t o l d last year that she w o u l d b e
i n f o r m e d of t h e S E N N E T p u b l i c a t i o n
date, i n advance, a n d h e r duties ex-
p l a i n e d to h e r , so that she c o u l d
organise a team for its distribution.
H o w e v e r , u n t i l the a p p r o a c h f r o m
F E L I X , she h a d not been contacted,
a n d so this issue c a m e out late, w i t h
the advertising leaflets not inserted,
but l a i d beside the forlorn piles.
T h i s year S E N N E T is distributed
free. T h i s w a s not m a d e clear Ly
the piles, b u t o n l y b y s m a l l h a n d -
bills attached to noticeboards i n t h e
vicinity. A s a result, some m o n e y was
p l a c e d i n t h e nearby F E L I X sales

O n e of t h e m a n y difficulties that
beset S E N N E T last year w a s that
m a n y of their agents f a i l e d to return
the cash collected f r o m sales (3d. p e r
enpy) to U L U . O n e issue w a s c a n -
celled d u e t o lack of cash, a n d only
after threats of lagal action was some
of t h e m o n e y b r o u g h t i n . A courage-
ous decision was m a d e to distribute
S E N N E T free this year i n the h o p e
that extra advertising revenue w o u l d
make u p t h e cash difference. T h i s
means that t h e distributors are n o
longer p a i d I d . p e r c o p y b u t g i v e
their services free—as do a l l F E L I X
staff. It also means that no auditor
can check claims of c i r c u l a t i o n of
S E N N E T , w h i c h finished last year
selling three thousand copies through
the then forty one colleges of U L U
(less than d o u b l e the sales of F E L I X ,
a n d also less than the sales of P I at
U n i v e r s i t y College). S E N N E T claims
to p r i n t a n d distribute t e n diousand
copies this year.
