FELIX 9
GONE WEST
YOUNG MEN
A P A R T Y O F twelve cricketers, led by L . C. Williams, left the
Union on the 28th of June, bound for the West Country. T h e first
game, theoretically, against Southampton University, was unfortun-
ately cancelled, and so we arrived at Bridport, and our first hotel,
rather earlier than expected.
T h a t evening, w e h a d o u r first
taste of the W e s t C o u n t r y brews a n d
were also introduced t o the local
forms of ten-pin b o w l i n g .
N e x t d a y w e m o v e d t o T o r q u a y
a n d o u r first game, w h i c h p r o v e d
very enjoyable. T h o result w a s a
draw. A t the close of p l a y I . C . need-
ed fourteen runs t o w i n , w i t h o n e
wicket i n h a n d . A f t e r the game w e
p i l e d into the coach a n d drove d o w n
to P l y m o u t h , w h e r e w e spent three
nights. H e r e w e p l a y e d t w o games,
the first against I I . M . S . ' D r a k e ' w e
lost b y 2 8 runs. A n early batting c o l -
lapse being the m a i n cause of the
disaster. T h e second game against
' P l y m o u t h C o l l e g e Staff' w a s d r a w n ,
a creditable performance since the
P l y m o u t h team i n c l u d e d t w o D e v o n
M i n o r C o u n t y spin bowlers.
O n Saturday w e returned to
T o r q u a y a n d o u r last hotel, a n d then
drove along the coast to B a b b a c o m b e .
H e r e w e overcame the home side b y
79 runs, i n spite of the rather u n -
usual ground. T h a t evening, o u r bests
entertained us at a local c l u b , w h e r e
we enjoyed ourselves until t h e early
hours of the m o r n i n g .
O n S u n d a y afternoon w e p l a y e d
' W h i m p l e a n d W h i t e w a y s ' , w i t h

A Good Start
T H E S O C C E R C L U B has m a d e
an extremely successful start to t h e
season. O n Saturday the l s t . I I beat
S o u t h a m p t o n for the first time i n
five years, a n d a l l the other teams
are d o i n g e q u a l l y w e l l , except for the1
seconds T h e record shows that the
only team to loose a game is the
seconds,—in fact a l l other games
have been w o n , the fifths h o l d i n g t h e
record for the highest score, i f this
earlv promise bears fruit the Soccer
C l u b is i n f o r one of its' most suc-
cessful seasons for a l o n g w h i l e .
So the total record w a s t w o w o n ,
t w o lost a n d four d r a w n . E v e n i f the
results do not appear t o o impressive,
the tour p r o v e d v e r y enjoyable f o r
all concerned a n d w a s certainly a
good m e t h o d of recovering f r o m
hours spent i n examination rooms.

THE SEASON BEGINS
A T T H E BEGINNING of each academic year the College sports'
clubs hope, above all, for success—naturally enough. For this to
become areality, and not just a castle in the sky dream, hard work
is required from both player and official alike. A lack of first class
talent is no excuse for despondency. A n average team, well organiz-
ed, is as good as a team of individualy good players, without
organization.
F r o m the c l u b officials, keenness a n d interest must pass to t h e players,
a n d v i c e versa. T o the players tine n t h . t e a m is as i m p o r t a n t as t h e l s t . a n d
for c l u b spirit, a n i m p o r t a n t k e y to success, must b e treated as such. T h e r e
must, also, be room for merit to make headway. Selection t h r o u g h ' i n
g r o u p ' friendship w i l l o n l y h a r m a c l u b a n d i t s ' record.
W e a l l k n o w that it gets c o l d a n d w e t i n w i n t e r ; some games w i l l i n -
v o l v e a lot of travel; grounds' a r e t r i c k y t o find a n d matches get c a n c e l l e d ; —
but this is not unexpected. If you've 'signed o n ' t o p l a y for the C o l l e g e
than all this s h o u l d have been taken into consideration. A 'fine d a y ' p l a y e r
is no asset t o a n y c l u b , a n d w i l l soo find this is so. I f a g a m e is w o r t h
p l a y i n g the it's w o r t h a little effort, a n d h a r d s h i p .
O f t h e league, c u p a n d f r i e n d l y games the c u p competitions carry the
most glory. I n these games, support is n e e d e d f r o m the C o l l e g e . T h e
R u g b y C l u b appear to have this w e l l organized, b u t this is not the rule,
more t h e exception. L a s t year the Soccer C l u b w a s i n v o l v e d i n t w o finals,
yet n o m o r e t h a n a d o z e n supporters a p p e a r e d — t h e r e this definitely r o o m
for improvement.
L e t ' s hope then, that dreams c a n c o m e true, a n d there are sufficient people
w i l l i n g to w o r k f o r them. T h e C o l l e g e c o u l d do w i t h a f e w more cups
i n t h e c u p b o a r d .

I.C. 9 pts.
Sandhurst 3 pts.
ON A FINE day at Blenheim
Park the I.C. lst. X V defeated a
fit, well drilled Sandhurst side by
three tries to one. The early stages
of the play went to I.C., mainly
due to the domination of the
College pack. Sandhurst opened
the scoring, completely against
the run of play, when their
centres seized on a mistake by
their opposite numbers. This
spurred I.C. to greater afforts and
a brilliant movement, followed
by a quick heel saw Mills send-
ing Riley in at the corner—
Molan failed to convert.
