Debateable
M o r a l i t y
T h e first debate of t h e n e w session,
w h i c h brought a confrontation
between M r . B l a c k h a m of the
B r i t i s h H u m a n i s t Society a n d A r c h -
bishop Roberts, S . J . , w a s poorly a t -
tended.
M r . B l a c k h a m , i n proposing t h e
m o t i o n that " m o r a l s s h o u l d b e seper-
ated from r e l i g i o n " asserted that
morals c o m m o n l y h a d been i n d e p e n d -
ent of religion as borne out b y t h e
evidence of anthropologists. M o r a l s
w e r e a function of society w h i c h d i d
not require external sanctions, a n d
h e c i t e d the H i g h w a y C o d e as a
simple example.
C h r i s Y e w l e t t of I . C . H u x l e y
Society a d d e d that since morals w e r e
often t i e d to religion, t h e obvious
decline i n the latter w o u l d l e a d to
a regrettable decline i n the former,
unless morals c o u l d b e s h o w n to b e
independent of religion.
T h e motion w a s so b a d l y w o r d e d
that A r c h b i s h o p Roberts w a s able to
agree w i t h m u c h o f w h a t t h e propos-
ers said. H e seized u p o n the w o r d
" s h o u l d " i n the m o t i o n , however, a n d
vigorously denied that those whose
morals were inspired b y religion
should b e so persecuted that their
religion w a s forcibly set aside.
M i k e H o p k i n s reinforced this point.
Others might make m o r a l judgments
however they w i s h e d , b u t for w h a t
v a l i d reason should the morals of a
Christian, f o r example, b e separated
from his religious belief?
