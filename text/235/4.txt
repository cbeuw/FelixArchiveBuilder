Getting into our stride
Y o u w i l l n o doubt h a v e n o t i c e d
the mistakes a n d b l a n k spaces i n t h e
last issue of F E L I X . N o one regrets
this m o r e t h a n w e , as i t is o u r a i m t o
produce a newspaper that t h e U n i o n
can be p r o u d of. A s the staff, n o t least
the E d i t o r , b e c o m e more e x p e r i e n c -
e d w e i n t e n d to take n e w steps for-
w a r d . A g o o d newspaper attracts a t -
tention to the C o l l e g e , especially t h e
attention of potential advertisers.
B u t w h i l e w e c a n i m p r o v e t h e
paper f r o m o u r e n d , i t is t h e u n i o n
members w h o p r o v i d e us w i t h , n e w s
directly or indirectly. I t is n o t pos-
sible for F E L I X to b e e v e r y w h e r e
a l l t h e t i m e ; i f y o u r society o r c l u b
has a m e e t i n g w h i c h is. i n t e r e s t i n g —
a n d most a r e — l e t us h a v e a report.
W e cannot guarantee that i t w i l l g o
in b u t w e w i l l d o o u r best. A n o t h e r
w a y i n w h i c h F E L I X c a n h e l p clubs
is b y means of the W h a t ' s O n
c o l u m n . A l l that is necessary is that
y o u send us f u l l details of meetings,
either fortnightly or for t h e w h o l e
t e r m at once.
O l d readers w i l l notice t h e return
of C o l c u t t to this paper. C o l c u t t is
a p s e u d o n y m : t h e n a m e b e i n g that
of the architect of Queen's T o w e r .
T r i e C o l c u t t c o l u m n a p p e a r e d first In
October 1 9 6 1 , some f e w months
after the President was finally a n d
permanently ous.ed f r o m h i s c o l u m n .

L a s t year there were, for a t i m e ,
t w o anonymous columnists. Because
these t w o took f u l l advantage of
their positions as critics, respecting
neither m a n n o r E x e c u t i v e , t h e
F E L I X B o a r d forced the E d i t o r t o
reveal t h e i r names. T h e n e w C o l c u t t
begins the year w i t h a n assurance of
his anonymity a n d m y wishes for
more p o w e r t o h i s p e n .

T h e first edition of F E L I X this
year set a record i n that i t s o l d o u t
i n thirty-six hours; i n previous years
sales have risen steadily throughout
the t e r m u n t i l they reached sell-nut
figures. It is, however,, regrettable
that not a l l t h e sales m o n e y w a s r e -
ceived. T h e most notable e x a m p l e of
this w a s i n t h e H u x l e y b u i l d i n g
w h e r e some 30s.0d. w a s missing.
O n c e again restored t o m y rightful state of a n o n y m i t y , I sit, vitriol-tip-
p e d p e n i n h a n d , ready to pour scorn a n d derision o n a l l a n d sundry.
A n x i o u s l y , e v e r y b o d y opens his F E L I X at C o l c u t t to see whose t u r n it is
to c o m e under the chopper. T h e E x e c , or the D o m e s t i c Bursar? T h e
R u g b y C l u b or t h e C l e r k to the H a l l s ? A b r i e f w o r d of explanation h e r e
for t h e benefit of freshers. I a m one o l t h e oldest gentelr. a n a l l . C .
h a v i n g t o m y credit countless threatened l i b e l suits a n d t h e h o n o u r of
h a v i n g designed I.C.'s c o n t r i b u t i o n t o t h e Space A g e , t h e Queen's T o w e r .
I have v e r y f e w friends.
T h i s year got oft t o its usual roaring start, w i t h t h e U n i o n i n a state
of utter chaos. T h e first E v e n t , t h e Freshers' H o p , w a s a n u n q u a l i f i e d
success w h e n one of t h e groups f a i l e d t o appear a n d nine h u n d r e d large,
hot, sweaty p e o p l e tried to p a i r themselves off i n t w o s m a l l , hot, sweatv
rooms. T h e n e w C r u s h H a l l b a r w a s v e r y m u c h a p p r e c i a t e d b y t h e s m a l l
g r o u p of stalwarts w h o m a n a g e d t o force their w a y t h r o u g h t o i t . It
c o u l d not have been more a p t l y n a m e d . I t appears that the H o p was
a r r a n g e d b y last year's C h a i r m a n o f E n t s a n d this year's C a r n i v a l O r g a n -
izer, J i m M u r r a y . U n f o r t u n a t e l y h e d i d not see e y e t o eye w i t h his
examiners. T h e organisation s h o u l d h a v e been taken over b y this year's
C h a i r m a n o f E n t s , B r i a n C o m p t o n . U n f o r t u n a t e l y h e d i d n o t see e y e t o
eye w i t h his examiners. A s a n emergency measure last year's unsuccessful
presidential c a n d i d a t e K e i t h G u y took over a n d spent t h e w e e k prior t o
the H o p i n hospital. I t seems a m i r a c l e t o m e that t h e H o p ever o c c u r -
red. I t ' is t y p i c a l of a malaise that runs t h r o u g h m u c h of t h e U n i o n ,
that both M u r r a y a n d C o m p t o n s h o u l d lose interest a n d let everybody
else sink or s w i m as best t h e y c o u l d , o n finding o u t that t h e y weren't c o m -
ing back. M u r r a y , i n fact, w a s g i v e n the U n i o n G e n e r a l A w a r d last t e r m
for his "outstanding services t o t h e U n i o n " . L e t us s a y a quiet p r a y e r
for the n e w Ents C o m m i t t e e , i f there is o n e y e t .
O n e of m y favourite targets for c r i t i c i s m is that section of t h e U n i o n
often to be f o u n d d i s t u r b i n g the peace i n t h e n e i g h b o u r h o o d of the b a r .
I regret that I h a v e been p i p p e d a t t h e post b y P h i l P o y s e r this year, w h o s
letter i n t h e last issue of F e l i x described, a c c u r a t e l y — e v e n moderately,
the events at a p a r t y at t h e e n d of last term. H e d i d n o t directly attribute
the damage t o a n y specific groups, b u t w e l l - k n o w n p e o p l e certainly w e r e
w e l l to the fore o n that unpleasant occasion. A l l t o o often i n t h e past,
this irresponsible g a n g of thugs ( a n d here I don't refer t o t h e w h o l e b a r
c r o w d , only that s m a l l , nasty section w h i c h insists .on m a k i n g its presence
felt b y b e i n g a nuisance) w h o have been a l l o w e d t o get a w a y w i t h m u r d e r
because no-one has been b i g e n o u g h to stop t h e m , a n d m a n y of t h e m h a v e
been senior U n i o n officers themselves a n y w a y . T h i s year b o t h t h e P r e s i d -
ent a n d D e p u t y - P r e s i d e n t , D u k e a n d M c B a i n , are l e a d i n g m e m b e r s of
the B a r . T h e y a r e , as w e have n o reason to doubt, y e t , b o t h v e r y respons-
i b l e people. L e t us h o p e that this year they c a n exercise some c a l m i n g
influence over their more h e a v y - d r i n k i n g confreres, a n d prevent a repet-
ition o f last year's record of behaviour. If the President can't d o i t , it
w o n ' t be long before some-one else, l i k e a n e w R e c t o r or t h e Senior
W a r d e n , decide t o take matters into their o w n hands.

Inaccuracy
Sir
I w o u l d l i k e t o correct a state-
m e n t m a d e i n t h e last issue of
F E L I X about failures i n D r a m s o c .
T h e r e w e r e o n l y four active m e m b e r s
w h o f a i l e d t o return. A s t h e Society
h a d a n active m e m b e r s h i p of 42 last
year, a n d over 6 0 members, this r e -
presents a failure rate w h i c h is about
the C o l l e g e average. W h i l e i t is true
w e lost some of o u r most needed
m e m b e r s , t h e figure is surely r e m a r k -
a b l y l o w , especially w h e n one c o n -
oid ers h o w active t h e Society w a s
last year; as a m i n o r example over
1000 m a n hours o f w o r k w e r e d o n e
b y the Society for C a r n i v a l W e e k .
It c a n be s a i d q u i t e fairly that
the organised activities of t h e
D r a m a t i c Society d i d n o t interfere
w i t h t h e m e m b e r s a c a d e m i c w o r k .
Social l i f e is a n essential part of t h e
D r a m a t i c Society b u t people c o n -
t i n u e d t o use t h e storeroom as a
social m e e t i n g place after C a r n i v a l
W e e k despite attempt t o discourage
this.
I f e e l that i n a c c u r a t e reports i n
F E L I X , especially i n its first issue,
m a y g i v e b a d impression b o t h i n t h e
U n i o n a n d i n t h e C o l l e g e , t h e latter
b e i n g a v e r y serious matter. I t m a y
also discourage other p e o p l e f r o m
j o i n i n g t h e Society thus l i m i t i n g t h e
assistance t h e Society gives to various
U n i o n activities.

That A d !
Sir,
A p r o p o s of the 'Support R h o d e s i a '
advertisement i n t h e last edition of
f k L I X , I a m at a loss t o understand
h o w F E L I X c o u l d sell itself t o s u c h
a l o w a n d debased t h e m e that violat-
es a l l canons of h u m a n , m o r a l a n d
e t h i c a l decency.
ssuming that y o u disassociated
yourself f r o m the advertisement
(judging b y a footnote) a n d also that
y o u d i d get a fat c h e q u e (judging b y
the space)—it is h a r d l y conceivable
that F E L I X c o u l d prostitute its c o d e
of c o n d u c t i n b e c o m i n g a n outlet t o
racist a n d near-fascist p r o p a g a n d a .
Surely, the virtues of F E L I X are*
above this.
