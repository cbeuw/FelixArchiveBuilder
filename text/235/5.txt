Some might call him a zebra. To me he's Socrates. Matches the scarf, too. Difficult in the digs. But not at
Martins. They understand. They're so friendly at Martins—especially to students.
Marlins have an especial knowledge of a student's need to budget grants and allowances carefully which is why so
many students find it worthwhile to open an account atMarlins.
Martins go to extremes to be helpful
