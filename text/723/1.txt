Ash Agrees To
Burgess Plan
Union President Carl Burgess
has reached an agreement with
the Rector, Professor Eric Ash,
that will prevent the Union
losing control of the Lower
Lounge. Mr Burgess met with
Professor Ash and College
Secretary John Smith on
Tuesday to discuss the Union
Building issue. It was agreed at
this meeting that the Union
Dining Hall and Senior
Common Room would be
available to the Department of
Biology for use as seminar
rooms. The Lower Lounge will
not be converted into a lecture
theatre, as College
administration had initially
intended (see FELIX No 721).
The conversion of the
Botany/Zoology common room
into a lecture theatre for
Biology is to go ahead as
planned, however.
The original decision to
transfer control of the rooms
was taken at a meeting of the
Rector's policy committee. The
Union was not consulted.
Professor Ash agreed to discuss
the matter following
representations from Mr
Burgess over how the decision
was made. IC Union Executive
met on Monday and approved
alternative proposals suggested
by Mr Burgess.
Mr Burgess told FELIX that
Professor Ash and Mr Smith
expressed complete agreement
with his proposals at the
meeting on Tuesday. He had
said that for Biology to take
over the Lounge would be an
inefficient use of the room. The
UDH and the SCR could be
made available for Biology to
use as morning seminar rooms,
and it was undesirable to
duplicate existing facilities.
Professor Ash and Mr Smith
both acknowledged that the
Lounge was the only room
suitable for parties and discos.
It was accepted that the Union
should retain control of the
Lounge, and should let the UDH
and SCR to Biology for a
minimal fee. These plans will be
put forward for approval of the
Governing Body.
Mr Burgess also presented
Professor Ash with a document
expressing 'the feelings of the
student body'. He was
particularly concerned over the
general lack of communication
between College administration
Twenty Flight Rockers playing in the Lower Lounge
and the Union. Professor Ash
apparently agreed with much of
what Mr Burgess said, but
added that there were other
factors to take into account. He
also described Biology as one
of the 'up and coming'
departments. He thought that
the research projects were too
spread out and that it was
necessary to bring operations at
Silwood back to South
Kensington.
On Wednesday Mr Burgess
and Deputy President Dave
Kingston had a meeting with
Keith Garwood, a senior
Administrator at Queen Mary
College, to discuss the takeover
of the Union bar. Mr Garwood
told them that the turnover of
the Q M C bar is £130,000, and
its net surplus £20,000. IC
Union bar has a turnover of
£135,000 and, according to the
figures available, a surplus of
only £6,500 before overheads.
Mr Garwood said that the bar
must be run as a separate
trading enterprise, and that the
revenue from it could not be
used to subsidise the Union
subvention directly. He added
that refurbishment costs would
normally be met by the brewery.
Mr Burgess and Mr Kingston
are still investigating the
licensing arrangements for a
student run Union Bar. If a Club
License or a Justice's License is
obtained it will not be necessary
for the Union to obtain a legal
identity. The Union lawyer has
advised Mr Burgess that a
corporate legal identity could
be set up for the Bar alone, not
affecting the Union as a whole.
This course of action would go
against the wishes of the
College Secretary. Mr Smith
told FELIX last week that he
would prefer the Union to have
its own legal identity in order to
achieve some independence
from College administration. He
added that the Union wil be
provided with all the available
information on the finances of
the Bar. He was not, however,
prepared to use staff resources
to produce more detailed
accounts.
The Union bar floor was
inspected recently by the
Estates section It was decided
that the floor could undergo a
further two sandings before it
would have to be replaced. This
represents an additional
lifespan of 6 to 8 years. The
cost of replacement was
estimated at approximately
£2,500, an amount which
contrasts sharply with the figure
of £20,000 which had been
widely reported.
