IC 1st XV 0 UCL 1st XV 8
IC slumped to a shock
defeat in this vital UAU
qualifier at Harlington last
Wednesday.
Weakened yet again by the
uncompromisng requisition
orders of ULU and seeming
never quite to warm up in the
arctic conditions, the IC
pack lost too much set-piece
possession to the more
urgent UCL eight.
Starved of any decent
ball, the IC backline found
itself having to defend
more often than not and
was pressurised into
squandering much of the
possession that was
gained.
So came to an end the
glowing start to the season
which saw eight wins in
nine outings— however, an
encouraging game against
a strong Saracens team on
Saturday suggested that IC
will be difficult to beat in
the Gutteridge Cup.
Ladies Rugby
The IC Virgins played a
brilliant match on Sunday,
November 17 against
Charing Cross at
Harlington. IC drew against
them, although IC should
have won. IC kept the ball
down their end of th'e field
in both the first and second
halves. Vicki Williams was
within about 2 feet of a try
when sadly, she was
tackled. And Captain Anne
scored a try which
everyone saw, except the
referee who did not count
as he wasn't wearing his
glasses. But being fair—the
Ref was a good lad and
showed no bias.
There were only a few
near fatalities. These
included poor Nathalie
Laidler getting booted in
the ribs (which resulted in
her being made to sit on
the sidelines for a few
minutes).
Anne Parsons got bitten
in the ruck (painful!-Ed).
Afterwards the Charing
Cross girls said they had
never played so violent a
game before.
Water Polo
On Friday IC recorded its
third win of the season by
beating an impressive
Royal Navy side 15-11
This win was obtained by
an understrength team
missing two of its strongest
players, Andy Longman
and Steve Davis. Many of
IC's substitute players,

though, put up spirited
performances against
'experienced' opposition.
Although IC expected
this to be a physical
contest, the only serious
sufferer was Paul
Richardson who, despite
some heavy tackling,
managed to score a
beautiful goal from his own
half early in the third
quarter to turn the tide
against the Navy team.
Other scorers were Nigel
Williams, Rob Easterman,
the highest scorer so far,
and Nick Ireland, who
scored with a spectacular
shot from the opposition's
half in the final quarter of
the game.
Boat
At the Allam Cup, an event
for University of London
crews, Imperial lad the way
and swept aside the
opposition.
In the Allam Cup event
itself which is for men's
Open VIM's IC beat crews
from Q M C and London
Hospital. This was the first
time the new eight Eric Ash
was raced.

pairs IC again won, this
time beating crews from
QMC, Royal Free, Charing
Cross, London Hospital,
UCH, St Mary's and Kings.
The men's scullers
competed in all three
events namely Open,
Senior C and Novice Sculls
and won all three, the latter
of these nearly catching the
race ahead. The IC Senior
C men's coxed four beat
UCH and London Hospital
in their semi-final before
annihilating St Georges in
the final. This left the
Novice men's VIM to see
how they would fare in
their first race ever. In the
quarter-final round they
rowed through Kings and
St Thomas' to win by two
lengths. In the semi-finals
they lost by a length in a
spirited performance but
were disadvantaged rowing
in a much older boat than
their opposition.
The women entered three
events, Womens Open
VIM's Open IV's and Novice
IV's. They saw off
oppositions from Barts,
UCH , Guys, St Mary and
Kings in the Open Vlll's.
They also beat Royal Free
in a hard race in the Open
IV's final. The women's
squad completed their hat-
trick of wins by winning the
womens Novice IV's.

UAU Individual
Championships
In the mens singles, Andy
McAleer was unlucky to
have a hard draw, and was
knocked out rapidly. Gary
Chapman fared better,
beating his first-round
opponent 15-4, 15-4, but he
encountered difficulties in
the second round, losing
15-7, 15-4. SL Tan put up a
fantastic performance
against the no.4 seed and
was unlucky to lose in a
very close match.
Sarah Threadgold had an
unlucky draw against the
no.4 seed in the ladies
singles and lost in the first
round. Susan Yates did
better winning her first
round match 11-4, 11-7.
However she was then
beaten by the no.3 seed.
In the mixed doubles, the
newly formed partnership
of Dave Heaps and Julie
Goodeve were unlucky to
lose a close match, as were
Bharat Popat and Sarah
Threadgold. The best
performance came from
Sean Mulshaw and Susan
Yates, who beat pairs from
Southampton and Hull,
before losing 15-10, 15-11
to the no.4 seeds from
Loughborough.
Bharat Popat and SL Tan
produced IC's best result in
the competition. In the first
round they beat a pair from
Swansea, in the second
they beat a Kent pair (one
of whom won the mens
singles), in the third round
they beat Exeter, in the
fourth round they beat
Bristol but they lost to
Loughborough in the
quarter-finals. Andy
McAleer and Gary
Chapman lost in the first
round as did Sean Mulshaw
and Dave Heaps.
Ski
Unprecedented in IC Ski
history, the dry-slope Ski
team consisting of
Katherine Milrow, Martin
Steber, Mark Schmidt,
Matthew Norris and Mike
Johnston surged to a
fabulous victory in
Saturday's ski competiton.
This impressive
performance at Welwyn
Garden City puts IC in 2nd
place in a league of 14
University of London
Teams.
Skiing is taking on so
fast at Imperial that we
were even able to send a
2nd team (coming 9th) to
the event.
FELIX Friday 29 November 13
