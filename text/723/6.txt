0 IC And The
Environment
Public awareness of
environmental issues has
grown considerably over
the last decade, and this
has been partly due to the
work of Greenpeace and
the other pressure groups.
The result is a growing
public concern, which is
reflected in an increase in
the amount of scientific
research aimed at
investigating the impact
technological developments
have on the environment
with radioactive releases.
Yet, at present there is a
great deal we don't
understand about the ways
that radioactive pollutants
become dispersed in the
environment, and the
detrimental effects on
health that may result from
exposure to very small
doses of radiation. It is
important that governments
and the public have access
to high quality information,
so that balanced
judgements can be made
on the basis of both social
and scientific factors.
Here at Imperial Colege
there are a growing number
of research teams
concerned with the
interaction between
scientific developments and
the environment. One such
team is the Environmental
Safety group in the
Mechanical Engineering
Department, headed by
Professor A Goddard. Their
work focuses on the
: relationship between
engineering plants and the
environment, in particular,
the risks associated with
radioactive releases. Much
of their work is theoretical
and based in the
Mechanical Engineering
Department but they are
also involved in a great
deal of interdisciplinary
I work, which has involved
moving across the
interdepartmental
boundaries at Imperial. The
setting up of the
Environmental Technology
Centre in 1976 paved the
way for this type of work
but it is still a formidable
task to coordinate projects
between departments.
However, the breadth of
experience gained makes
up for this.
A great deal of data on
the effects of exposure to
high levels of radiation has
been collected from studies
on the victims of
Hiroshima, and on people
who have suffered
industrial exposure. The
link between human
exposure to relatively high
levels of radiation, and the
incidence of cancer and
genetic effects is now
widely accepted. However,
much less is known about
the effects of exposure to
smaller doses from artificial
sources because they are
generally swamped by
variations in the natural
background level. So most
people work on the basis
that even the lowest doses
of radiation may cause
adverse effects. Then the
decison has to be made as
to whether man-made
radiation exposure is only
acceptable if it produces
direct beneficial effects, or
as long as it remains
insignificant in relation to
the natural background
level. In the case of medical
exposure people accept
that the benefits outweigh
the dangers. But, the case
of nuclear power plants is
far more contentious and
people have a right to know"
the full facts before
decisions are made.
Professor Goddard's
team have developed
expertise in many aspects
of the way radioactive
releases, accidental or
otherwise, are dispersed in
the environment. In the
past their work has covered
theoretical modelling of
dispersal around buildings,
near shorelines (where
nuclear power stations tend
to be built) and over longer
ranges. Working for the
European Community, they
have been looking into the
transfrontier implications in
the event of an accident.
Emergency procedures at
nuclear power stations are
clearly of importance and
Dr Apsimon of the group is
currently involved in
developing improved
methods for predicting
consequences in the event
of a major incident. In
these difficult
circumstances, decisions
would have to be made to
protect people, while
detailed information would
be lacking.
Pathway analysis for
radioactive pollutants is
particularly complex as
cloud exposure, inhalation,
and ingestion of
.contaminated foodstuffs, all
have to be considered.
Computer models are used
for much of this work, but
the data has to be based on
a thorough understanding
of the transfer processes of
pollution in the
environment. As an aid to
studying how radioactivity
from the atmosphere
becomes incorporated into
crops, a new inter-
departmental wind tunnel
has been built at Silwood
Park. The tunnel, which
was designed by Dr Taylor-
Russel from Aeronautics,
was inaugurated by the
Rector on 25 October. Dr
Bell from Pure and Applied
Biology, and Miss Minski
frdm the Reactor Centre
are collaborating on this
project, which should
provide valuable
information for the
assessment of risk in the
event of accidental release
of radioactive pollutahts
The late 1984 there was
an exceptional release of
radioactive waste into the
Irish Sea, from Sellafield.
Following this event, the
Department of the
Environment asked the
College to make a study of
radioactivity levels in
domestic dust in Cumbria.
From this project the group
collaborated with the
Reactor Centre, who have
experience in working with
low levels of radioactivity,
and the Applied
Geochemistry Research
Group (AGRG) under Dr
Thornton. The A G R G have
been looking at lead levels
in the environment, and
their experience in
conducting surveys, and
dealing with local
authorities and the public
has proved to be
invaluable. The local soils
in Cumbria naturally
contain a low level of
radiation and the aim of the
project was to discover
whether any radioactivity
found in the buildling
resulted from this natural
soil radiation, or if it was
coming from the seaspray
as a consequence of the
waste release. The joint
paper is expected to,come
out in late December or
early January.
The group's work also
covers the implications of
pollution releases on a
European scale; more than
10 years ago they were one
of the first research teams
at Imperial College to gain
European Community
backing. Using
meteorological data
extending over the whole of
Europe, Dr Apsimon has
developed computer
models to predict the
trajectories of pollutants.
These methods, which were
originally developed to
study radioactive releases
and their transfrontier
effects, are now being used
in Germany to study the
acid rain problems. It is
believed that many of the
current problems affecting
German forests are caused
by pollution from other
European countries, in
particular, those Eastern
European countries that
burn high sulphur coals. It
is hoped the studies will
either provide evidence that
pollution is coming from
these countries, or show
that the problem results
from vehicle emissions and
is a much more widespread
problem.
As our understanding of
the interaction between
technological developments
and the environment
increases, it will allow
more balanced judgements
to be made. More
importantly, however, this
increased knowledge will
allow us to take steps to
protect the environment.
