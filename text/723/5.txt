•Payment of tuition fees by local
education authorities With the
abolition of the minumum
maintenance award some students
may be under the impression that
College tuition fees relating to their
course of study will be paid
automatically by their local
education authority without any
action by themselves. This is not the
case, and unless formal application
is made annually to an L E A
payments for tuition fees will not be
made by the L E A . It is essential,
therefore, that any students who
have not so far made formal
application to their L E A should do so
as a matter of urgency.
