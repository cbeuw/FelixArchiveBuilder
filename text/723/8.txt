For many students a grant is now a vague memory, either
spent or down to the last few pounds, time now to think of
claiming money over the Christmas vacation. This article
should give you an idea of what you can claim and how to
do it.
Undergraduate Students
The undergraduate student
grant contains an element
of £27.50pw to cover your
living expenses during the
Christmas and Easter
vacations. Unlike term-time,
there is no element
included in the grant for
rent over these periods. If
you have to pay rent during
these vactions, you are
entitled to claim the money
back.
Postgraduate Students
Postgraduate grants
contain living and rent
elements for 52 weeks of
the year and therefore
postgraduate students have
no extra eligibility for
benefits over the vacations.
How to claim and what to
claim:
Unemployment Benefit
The calculations behind
this benefit are long and
complicated particularly
over the Christmas vacation
as the conditions of
eligibility change on
January 1st.
Who is eligible: Anyone
who has paid or been
credited with National
Insurance contributions on
earnings of at least £1689
in the tax year 1983/84 will
be eligible for the entire
vacation period. Anyone
who has paid or been
credited with National
Insurance contributions on
earnings of at least £1767
in the tax year 1984/85 will
be eligible from the 1st
January. If you only
become eligible from
January 1st DO NOT
APPLY IN.DECEMBER, if
you do you will be ruled
ineligible and your claim
will remain invalid for the
entire vacation. This is
called the 8 week rule.
To claim: Go to your local
U n e m p l o y m e n t Benefit
Office on the first weekday of
the vacation and 'sign on' as
unemployed and available
for work. They will need
proof of your identity and
will need to know your
National Insurance number.
Read on to the section on
Standard Housing Benefit.
It is worth noting that
Unemployment Benefit can
be claimed from any
Unemployment Benefit
Office in the area you are
staying in when you
become eligible. If you are
claiming Unemployment
Benefit you should be able
to claim Standard Housing
Benefit.

payment of Certificated
Housing Benefit.
The Term 'householder' is
loose and ill-defined and
open to appeal but
obviously the DHSS will
seek to classify students as
non-householders if
possible.
Non-householders: Most
students living with a
landlady/landlord or
sharing a flat with friends
will be classed as non-
householders and as the
living element in the grant
is a slightly higher amount
than the non-householder
rate, you will not qualify for
Supplementary Benefit and
will not be eligible for
Certificated Housing
Benefit.
Housing Benefit
Supplement
If you do not qualify for
Supplementary Benefit, the
DHSS should still make an
assessment for Housing
fee;

Which method should you
use?
A) Staying in London:
There are two methods of
claiming rent money back,
the one to use depends
partly on whether you
intend to remain at your
term-time address over the
Christmas period. The
fastest and most efficient
way to get the maximum
amount, if you are eligible,
is to 'sign on' as
unemployed with the
Department of Health and
Social Security, the DHSS.
For payments from the
DHSS, Certificated Housing
Benefit, you need to be in
London throughout the
Christmas period, be
classed as a householder
and be available for work in
the area in which you live.
B) Going Home: However,
for those who do not want
to remain in London over
the Christmas break but
have to pay rent for a term-
time address you can still
claim the money back
through Standard Housing
Benefit.
If you have ever been
employed: In addition to
Housing Benefit those who
have been employed in the
relevant tax year, see next
section, may be entitled to
Unemployement Benefit.
Staying in London:
Certificated Housing
Benefit
This form of Housing
Benefit is only available to
those able to 'sign on' as
unemployed and available
for work in the area in
which they are paying rent.
It is also dependent on your
eligibility for Supplementary
Benefit
To Claim: Go to the local
Unemployment Benefit
Office on the first weekday
of the vacation and 'sign
on' as unemployed and
available for work. If you
are not eligible for
Unemployment Benefit
then your papers will
automatically be forwarded
to the local DHSS. The
Unemployment Benefit
Office will tell you if and
when they want you to
'sign on' again and will give
you form B1 to take or
send to your local DHSS
office. The DHSS may call
you for an interview and
will need proof of identity
and your financial situation
ie recent bank statements
etc. The DHSS pay a basic
living allowance and will
authorise the local Housing
Authority to pay
Certificated Housing
Benefit. The Housing
Authority will send out
forms to be completed t'o
be returned with proof of
rent and rates. Payments of
Benefit are considered a
priority and should be
processed within fourteen
days, though they rarely
are.
The main disadvantage of
the Certificated Housing
Benefit system is its
dependence on eligibility
for Supplmentary Benefit
which excludes a large
proportion of students.
Who will qualify: Students
not receiving grants should
qualify, other students will
have to rely on the
possibility of being
classified as a
'householder', by the DHSS.
There are two types of
Supplementary Benefit —
householder and non-
householder. A
householder is defined as
someone who is solely
responsible for meeting all
the costs of their
'household' and they
receive a slightly higher
rate of Supplementary
Benefit.
Householders: However,
some students living in
individual bedsits may be
classed as 'householders'
and as the student vacation
element is lower than the
'householder' rate you
should be eligible for a
small weekly sum from the
DHSS and in these cases
the DHSS will authorise
long
provide you with slightly
more benefit than if you
approached the Housing
Authority direct.
How to claim if you are
leaving London for the
vacation
Standard Housing Benefit
Some of you will hopefully
already have submitted
claims for Standard
Housing Benefit during
term-term although most of
you will still be awaiting the
result of your claim. During
the short vacation your
official weekly income
drops to £27.50 pw and
there is no rent element
included in this sum, so if
you claim standard
Housing Benefit over the
vacation you will receive
considerably more than
term-time. Students who
were not eligible in term-
time using this system
should be eligible for some
money back in the vacation
due to a drop in income.
This benefit doesn't involve
any 'signing on' and can be
paid even if you are not
resident in your term-time
address over the vacation.
To claim-if you have
already submitted a claim:
In theory if you have
already submitted a claim,
stating term dates you
should automatically be
re—assessed. In practice
this rarely happens. It is
wise to write to the
Housing Benefit Office and
state that it is now vacation
time and that as your
weekly income is only
£27.50 pw you wish to have
your Housing Benefit
reassessed for the period
14th December 1985-5th
January 1986. Also inform
them that you will not be
working over the vacation.
They will send you a
declaration to this effect,
for you to sign.
To claim-if you haven't
already submitted a claim:
You should submit claim
forms the week before term
ends. Student Services has
forms for 22 boroughs, if
we haven't got the one you
need then we can tell you
where to get hold of them.
When you submit your
form you will need to
include proof of your grant
from your Local Education
Authority, proof of rent is
rent book/rent receipt/letter
from your landlord/letter
from Student Services if we
are your landlord and a
note of your term dates.
Remember claims will not
be backdated so apply
before the vacation, not
after.
