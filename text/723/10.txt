£4.50 Love
There is a disturbing trend
among some contemporary
rock guitarists to compete
for what one might call Jim
Hendrix credibility. There is
also a disturbing trend
among modern audiences,
for turning concerts into
boxing marathons. Both
were in evidence at the
Hammersmith Palais last
Sunday where The Cult
wound up their UK tour.
Despite this they produced
an evening of searing sweat
and entertainment.
Hippies are back, no
quesiton about it. Ian
Astbury looks like a cross
between Jim Morrison and
Neil of the Young Ones,
although where Morrison
was the eloquence of a
generation Astbury's
vocabulary consists largely
of 'Ta'. From even before
they came on to a blaze of
projectors there was no
doubt that the evening was
laced with the trappings of
psychadelia. The
symbolism embellishing the
new album 'Love' is a
ringer for Led
Zeppelin/Blue Oyster Cult,
the titles echoes of the
peace generation. They
even played Doors and
New Faces over the PA
between bands. But this is
a new sort of love and
peace, threashing along to
reverberating guitar,
pierced by tribal rhythms.
And out on the floor almost
the whole area seethed
with flailing people. The
bare chested heavies were
'chicken dancing' almost
before the group came on,
but this wasn't about a
small crowd at the front,
this was total audience
reaction.This sort of gig is a
physical endurance test, I
was surprised no-one got
hurt -most of all me.
With gigs like this at tne
Palais one wonders why
the Hammersmith Odeon
bothers to stay in business.
Table Tennis
The table tennis club is still
looking for high standard
League players for its first
and second teams. Anyone
interested please contact
Andy Lenny on internal
5957 or come up to the
table tennis room which is
on the top floor of Beit
building east. The club
meets every Wednesday
afternoon and Tuesday and
Thursday lunchtimes. We
are now well into the
season with relatively
infrequent victories being
scored but alas, these have
been overshadowed by
more frequent losses.
Model Aircraft
'Ere, Arthur, what's this?'
Terence, my son, this is
the latest 35MHz, 4 channel
transmitter from those
clever little orientials. Just
give the propeller a spin
will you? There's a good
lad'
'Arthur, what's this all
about?'
'My latest enterprise, my
son. I recently purchased
these aforementioned items
from a reputable dealer,
and should be able to get a
ton on the radio, and a
pony on the 'plane'.
'Leave it out Arthur-the
battery (cockney rhyming
slang-battery—Battery
Pack—ICMAC) will never
buy that'
'Now that is where you are
wrong, Terence— you're
getting as bad as 'er
indoors. No, as long as Mr
Chisholm keeps his nose
out, we're well in. I might
go and see ICMAC above
Southside bar on
Thursday'.
Arthur Daley toyed with
the controls and the plane
looped and rolled in the
sky. The 'plane climbed
and plunged in a series of
uncontrolled stall turns.
Arthur smiled. 'I think I'm
onto a nice little turner' he
said.
A board of inquiry was set
up to investigate last
week's horrific incident in
the JCR. A masked man,
thought to be the Phantom
Soaker, carrying a bucket
was pursued into the J C R
by a patrol of QT vigilantes
In the confusion one ever
so slightly over zealous QT
Chairman thought the
Phantom was escaping
justice, and promptly blew
him away.
According to fellow
patrol members the
chairman followed correct
procedures before firing by
shouting 'Halt! Drop that
bucket and raise your
hands, or I shall be forced
to shoot'. However a
number of witnesses have
QT
claimed that he actually
said 'Eat lead S o a k e r -
make my day!'
The body was dragged
from its pool of blood by
the patrol over to the Union
building, where it was
unfortunately mislaid.
Therefore the identity of
the suspect remains
unknown: Was it the
Soaker or was it the
College window cleaner?
The Board retired to
consider their verdict after
being advised by the
Chairman of their future
prospects for advancement
within the QT. Their
verdict: the Chairman had
been slightly naughty and
shouldn't do it again—too
often
Many thanks to all those
who supported RCSU
events during Rag Week,
especially those who spent
last weekend playing '1
million and 1—down' darts.
Looking forward to this
weekend, and on Sunday
RCSU is having its
Freshers'(!) Barnight in the
Union Bar, starting 7pm.
Better late than never, this
is the one that was
RCS
postponed, from the first
week of term, by the bars'
boycott. There will be free
barrels on for boat racing
and for freshers to try a
yard or half yard. We'll also
be christening the new
'Song Sheet'.
Finally a reminder to all
RCSU officers and reps
that Gen Comm is on
Monday 6pm in the
Lounge, Union Building.
