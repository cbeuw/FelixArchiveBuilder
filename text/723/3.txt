returned to the Union just
after Dave had booked the
minibus; he showed
surprise at being told that
Budget had no van booked
for us, but on hearing that
Dave had booked another
van for us, was quite happy
to leave the matter at that,
with no thought of an
apology even crossing his
mind.
We, the badminton club,
don't know if any other
club has encountered 31
/2
hour delays, but be
warned!!

Where Goop?
Dear People,
Sometime between Sept
20th and now, a box of my
junk has been removed
(probably accidentedly)
from the Garden House
basement store-room in
house 12.
Would the unfortunate
guardian of my saucepan,
cookbooks (2 veggie),
assorted rag-mags,
ashtrays, signs etc please
give them to the people at
the RCSU Office, so that
they can look after it until
my next visit back
(Sometime in December).
Yours hopefully
C Crosskey
Dear Dean
Dear Professor Sayers,
As you are no doubt aware
there is much strong
feeling in the department
about the loss of a room
free for undergraduates.
We realise that the
department has been
forced into this by a
shortage of teaching space,
and that this problem will
worsen with the increase in
undergraduate numbers
next year.
With departments such
as ours expanding while
others stagnate or even
contract the time has now
come for central control of
lecture theatres and
teaching rooms. These are
a valuable resource. If the
only fault of the current
system was for rooms such
as LT145 to be
uncomfortably full when
other rooms are half empty
that would be bad enough.
However both the loss of
the undergaraduates' room
and the planned takeover
of the Lounge and Bot/Zoo
tearoom by the Biology
Dept. can be traced to the
same problem.
If rooms for teaching
were shared, with many
departments possibly using
one room throughout a
day, then all these
problems would be solved.
Initially only small changes
to currrent patterns would
be needed, so
administrative effort would
be small. However as
relative sizes of
departments change then
more changes would be
needed, increasing
administrative effort.
However the savings in
time and money would
increase too. To have two
departme'its short of space
for teaching when the U G C
has criticised Imperial for
having foo much of this
type of space is surely
evidence of infelixibility
leading to inefficency.
Three students from DoC
2 brought this matter up in
another context with the
College Secretary on
November 11th, and he
agreed that central control
would solve many
problems, that the idea has
been mooted before, and
that it had failed due to
resistance from
departments.
But surely now is the
time for action. We the
undersigned in Doc 2 call
on the college to prepare a
plan of change to be
presented at The 5th March
1986 House Committee and
implemented before the
beginning of the next
academic year.
We ask also that you
consider lending your
support to the idea, and
await your reply.

Copy sent to FELIX
Posters
Dear Hugh,
Sadly, last week some
rather small-minded
student(s) decided to tear
down and trample over our
CND posters entitled 'Can
Russia Cheat'. Obviously
someone thinks that the
defence of democracy and
our freedom of speech
must not be jeopardised by
anything—including those
freedoms themselves.
To quote Carl Burgess:
'Anyone caught damaging
any society's posters will
be sent to a disciplinary
Committee who have the
power to fine and/or ban
from the union'.
I often find posters
offensive, for example the
FCS efforts and some of
the more sexist offerings
that we've seen recently,
however if I were to do
something about any of
them, it would be to speak
to those concerned.
Indeed, if someone has a
genuine grievance over our
advertising literature I
would be happy to try to
make it more 'acceptable',
surely, though, people who
tear down anything they
don't agree with should
start asking themselves
some serious questions.
Yours sincerely
Mark Herman
ICCND Chairperson.
The End?
Dear Sir,
Last Friday's Guilds
Carnival has been widely
acclaimed as one of the
best events to have been
held in College for a long
time. All the different acts
were of a consistantly high
quality so that everyone
could make the most of all
that was going on. In good
faith we orgainsed the best
quality entertainment for a
grand finale to Rag week
with every expectation of
making a good profit for
charity. Professional
entertainemnt does not
come cheap, so we had to
raise the cost by 50p from
last year to £4.00. Was that
really too much to pay? Do
members of College want
Top-of-the-Pops style
entertainment for the price
of a cattle-market disco?
Sadly, there were not
enough people present and
a large loss has been made.
In Guilds we have been
asking ourselves what went
wong. Publicity in terms of
posters, handbills and
FELIX was well covered.
The ticket sellers were out
in most departments and
the groups, comedians and
discos were carefully
selected, so what did go
wrong? We would like to
know.
At the moment we will
have to assume that
members of College do not
want or are not prepared to
pay for good quality ents
and therefore we will be
recommending that similar
events do not take place
again.
We deeply regret the loss
of union money on this
venture.
Yours sincerely and
despondently on behalf of
City and Guilds Union
