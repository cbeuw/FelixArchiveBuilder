New College 1st 2 IC 1st 1
IC lost their 100% League
record in the ULU Premier
Division to a side who had
obviously thought hard
before the game on how
best to play against IC,
their tactics eventually
paying off.
It all started so well with
IC going one up after 10
minutes when Dave Lynne
met Martin Bradley's
curling free kick with a
header which went in off
the post. Despite several
more goalscoring
opportunities which IC
were later to rue, the score
remained 1-0 until half-
time.
The second half was
finely poised when New
College equalised with a
hotly disputed goal with the
referee 'I laugh when I'm
joking' judging 3 New
College players all offside
but not interfering with play
( one of them scored the
goal).
With Nick Tarn
performing acrobatics in
goal, the game appeared to
be heading for a draw
when IC, obviously
dreaming of the high
standard of football that the
ref had been in control of,
allowed New to take both
points from the game from
a corner followed by a goal
mouth scramble.
R S M 1sts 4 IC 2nds 1
In a thrilling display of
wildly dazzling stunningly
brilliant one touch football,
RSM 1st's, a team surely
unparalleled in the
brilliance and verve of their
attacking play since the
Brazilians of 1970, swept
aside the miserable
mumbling wretches of IC
2nds with an overwhelming
tide of four goals
marvellously created and
clinically finished by a
group of players whose
skill on the football field is
surely only matched by
their humility and
generosity off it. After
battering IC's goal the
deadlock was broken after
20 minutes by Pete 'Bullet'
Sedders, who added
another ten minutes later
past the cowering imbecile
who now guarded the
visitors goal. Second half
goals came from 'Curly'
Woodward and 'Chopper'
Wardle as the annihilation
was completed. IC actually
managed to score near the
end with their only shot on
goal.

Some of the articles have
been severely edited this
week. If you do fill your
articles with 'in jokes',
names without surnames
etc, then they are of no use
to anyone but the 11 or 15
people who played. The
small ads is the place for
'in-jokes'.

Hockey
IC 1 City 1 (4-1 on flicks)
IC 1st XI hockey team,
having gained maximum
points in their UAU group,
played the Southeast finals
against City University on
Wednesday.
A scrappy but hard-
fought first half saw
Imperial with a 1-0 lead at
the break. Nick Hope
slotted home a right wing
cross before impaling
himself on the goal post. In
the second half City piled
on the pressure but the
home defence held out
desperately and the
opposition forwards found
it difficult to get into the
'D'. Special mention must
go to Jim Garside's
defenders for their
excellent 'do or die' tactics.
Eventually the City centre-
forward scored a brilliant
individual goal so ensuring
extra time. This too was
goalless, meaning the
match was to be settled on
penalty flicks.
Ian Parker, Paul Colman,
Justin Brooking slotted
their flicks to make it 3-1
leaving Nick Collie to seal
the match with his highly
deceptive, 'snail like' daisy
cutting flick.
IC moved into the last 16
to play Leeds University on
Wed 4 December.
IC 1sts 1 Harrow 2
Imperial started the match
intelligently, moving the
ball around and marking
the opposition tightly, this
led to a well taken goal by
Ian Parker, now the team's
highest scorer. In the
second half the opposition
ran the ball around and
with a little help from the
umpires scored two quick
goals from short corners,
lan's Parker's polite
comments to the umpire
about going to the
opticians meant Imperial
were down to ten men, but
the oppositon failed to
capitalize on it. The final
score was probably a fair
result. Moral of the game:
All old people go blind!
St Georges 1 IC Mixed 3
This was another epic day
for IC Hockey, with the first
mixed victory in quite a
while.
Perhaps the most
remarkable achievement on
Sunday was getting all the
team members to turn up,
more or less bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed after a
late night in that hot bed of
sin more commonly known
as Ms Rofe's flat. Then
come our first major set-
back as we narrowly
missed the train at
Waterloo (by fifteen
minutes), and had to wait
45 minutes for another one.
The game eventually
started a mere one and
quarter hours late but we
got off to a very good start
as Ann lost her skirt
warming up.
Penny Ottway, still in a
hypnotised state after
Thursday night,was our
star player managing to
score twice-sorry we didn't
have any Moet et Chandon.
Umpire Jon Stonham then
took pity on St Georges
and awarded them a very
controversial penalty flick
which St Georges greedily
snapped up.
With the light fading in
the second half IC took a
stranglehold grip on the
match with plenty of
penetrating attacks.
However the game had to
be stopped to deal with a
streaker on the pitch as Jill
Thurlbeck's skirt fell off
during a short corner. (It
should be noted that the
male half of the team does
not necessarily approve of
the ladies new designer
skirts.)
In the throws of the game
new recruit Pete
Drummond Smith scored
his virgin goal for an IC
team. (Its not all its cracked
up to be Pete), to take the
final score to 3—1.
All in all a good day
rounded off nicely with a
quick game of hockey on
the station platform at
Cobham against Guy's
Hospital—score nil all.
Tennis
Totteridge 8 IC Mixed 1
It was cold. It was early in
the morning and IC didn't
have a full team as J
Macmanus (Met and Mat 2)
didn't get out of bed in
time. Otherwise IC had no
excuses for losing the first
match of the season to a
team who were much better
than us on the day. The
team was M Morcos (Aero
1), B Hunt (Civ Eng 1), S
Cosulich (Biochem 1), and
A Hill (Mech Eng 1).
