IC Symphony
Orchestra
Today's the day! At last, the
musical event for which
you've all been waiting—an
unparalleled and staggering
evening's entertainment the
like of which has yet to be
seen within College...well,
actually it's ICSO's Autumn
term concert (but some of
that pre-amble still applies!)
Since it's the first concert
of the new year, we
thought that we'd tell you a
the Orchestra each year.
Well, that's enough about
our activities, now for a
brief word about our
conductor, Mr Richard
Dickins. He has been with
ICSO for over five years, in
that time the Orchestra has
grown both in numbers and
confidence. Ever more
outrageously ambitious
programmes are being
tackled from The Planets'
(students) will enable you
to hear the Orchestra in its
most romantic vein.
Tchaikovsky's 'Romeo and
Juliet' opens the concert
(It's got a very well-known
tune.) This will be followed
by 'The Lark Ascending' by
Vaughan-Williams. It's an
enchanting work for solo
violin and small orchestra,
based on the poety of
George Meredity. Visions of
the English countryside are
conjured up; it's a very
pastoral and calm piece. In
this performance, we are
fortunate to have David
Juntz, from the English
Chamber Orchestra,
playing the solo part.
David Juntz was born in
Cape Town, South Africa in
1957 and had his first violin
lessons at the age of six
from Noel Travers. At
seventeen he was awarded 4fe
a scholarship to study at JJJ
the Royal College of Music, DI
with Hugh Bean and _&
Jaroslav Vanecet. Whilst
there, he won all the major ^5
prizes for violin and SS
chamber music including ji
the Tagore Gold Medal. * f e
On leaving College in
1981, he joined the English
Chamber Orchestra, and
has since appeared as a
soloist with them, the
English Philharmonic and
many others. In February
this year, he had his South
Bank debut. David plays on
a fine Italian violin made by
Nicolo Lagliano in Naples,
circa 1750.
After the interval (to give
you time to recover from
this wonderful English
music), your senses will be
stunned by Rachmaninov's
2nd Symphony. It's a large-
scale and exceedingly
romantic work that is
exciting, poignant, sensual
and defintely worth
hearing!
ICSO are looking forward
to seeing you tonight—it
should be a good concert,
it will whet your appetite
for Mahler's 2nd
Symphony — next term!
little about what the
Orchestra gets up to, with
whom and where, and try
to entice you to this
evening's concert.
Imperial College
Symphony Orchestra has,
at present, about eighty
members. A good
proportion of these meet
every Wednesday at 7.00pm
in the Great Hall for a three
hour session of blowing,
scraping, bashing and
generally driving our
conductor to despair. In
addition to these weekly
rehearsals, there are
occassional repertoire
mornings when the
Orchestra tackle a wider
variety of music than in the
year's concert programmes.
An annual event that
everyone looks forward to
is the residential weekend,
held in the first term. The
venue is Silwood Park,
Imperial's field research
station near Ascot. This
provides a wonderful
opportunity for new
members to meet older
ones, and to play a great
deal of music in beautiful
surroundings. In between
full rehersals and much-
needed trips to the local
pub, chamber music
groups find time to meet
and get together. It's a very
concentrated weekend, but
one which is enjoyed by
Suite' to last year's epic,
Stravinksy's 'The Rite of
Spring'. And just wait for
next year's monumental
presentation...anyway,
back to the Maestro.
Richard Dickins began
his musical training as a
chorister (but he soon grew
out of that). In 1975 he
entered the R C M as a
clarinetist, and the
following year he was
awarded an exhibition. It
was at this time that he
began his conducting
studies with Norman Del
Mar. He left the College in
1979 having won a number
(which?) of prizes for both
clarinet playing and
conducting.
Richard's debut was in
1980 in the Albert Hall,
since when he has kept a
busy schedule, rushing
between La Scala,
Edinburgh, Sadler's Wells
and darkest Exmoor. He is
currently music director of
the Minehead and Exmoor
Festival, and the Covent
Garden Chamber
Orchestra. (What the
written word cannot convey
is the dynamic nature of
this man's conducting—it
has to be seen to be fully
appreciated!)
