Sherfield Shuffle
Plans for the new Sherfield
refectory were placed
before the Refectory Users'
Committee on Thursday.
This refectory is to be set
up in what is now the J C R ,
while the present refectory
will be converted into a
new JCR. One main
change shown on the plans
is the inclusion of a fast-
food counter where the
JCR bar is at present. In
the main servery, which is
where the Buttery is at
present, food counters will
be arranged around a salad
and drinks section, instead
of the present layout in
which they are placed
along one wall. The
students' dining area
(seating 450 people) will
have movable furniture and
partitions so that it can be
converted for formal
dinners.
The plans for the J C R
have not yet been revealed.
IC Union would like such
improvements as a
purpose-built bar, lowered
ceiling, movable partitions
and a lighting rack, to
enable them to arrange live
music and small discos.
The College Secretary has
informed the Union that
only the money for basics
is available. The work on
the changes is expected to
go on from Easter to the
end of the Summer term.
Union President Carl
Burgess does not intend to
approve the changeover
until he has received and
checked the plans of the
new JCR. But if approval
from the Union is not given
before the proposals are
taken to the Finance and
Executive Committees of
the Governing Body in
February, work could be
delayed for at least a year.
Late News
The plans were greeted
with general entusiasm by
the Refectory User's
Committee yesterday
afternoon. No decisions,
though, will be taken until
the corresponding plans for
the JCfl are available.

P H A R M A C E U T I C A L S

Refreshments will be
available.
Sultans Of Swing
Guilds Carnival has made a loss of between £500 and
£1000 because of low attendance. The exact deficit is not
yet known. Guilds entertainments officer Jill Cottee said
that the numbers were low because of poor response from
first year students. She descibed the event as 'a really
good evening' and complimented all the performers. She
added that the publicity for the event had been generally
good, but she was disappointed in the word-of-mouth
publicity around the college. People had not gone out and
encouraged others to buy tickets, and so not enough
interest had been generated.
Brothers In
Arms
College lecturers are to be
asked to strike next term by
the Association of
University Teachers. The
Imperial branch will ballot
its members between
December 6 and 18. The
AUT has recommended its
members to vote for up to
two one-day strikes which
must take place within 28
days of the ballot result. IC
AUT officials though have
yet to make a
recommendation. January
15 has been earmarked as
a probable date for the first
strike.
It will be left to individual
lecturers whether the lost
lectures are rescheduled.
The action is both a protest
at the current 4% pay offer
and a stand against the
continuing erosion of
university education.
Pizza
Hotline
Roger Pownall, Manager of
Southside bar is 'very
pleased' with the response
to the new food and wine
bar. The bar provides
freshly baked pizzas,
ploughman's lunches,
salads and coffee at
lunchtime and in the
evenings. A consumer told
FELIX that the pizzas are
'not as good as Pizza
Express, but are
significantly cheaper'.
Some concern was
expressed over the time
delay between ordering and
receiving the food.
However, Mr Pownall has
assured FELIX that this is
only a teething problem,
and he is encouraging
people to order their pizzas
in advance on the pizza
hotline 3286.
