Intensive
Care
Third year chemist Andrew
Healey is in intensive care
with thallium poisoning. Mr

after his flat mates raised
the alarm. Mr Healey was
using thallium for his third
year project. College safety
authorities are
investigating.
Several IC students imitated a fruit machine at Covent
Garden last Saturday to raise money for Rag Week. With a
few changes of cast, the 'show' went on long enough to
collect £128.21, 5 pesetas and 2 Irish pence. Playing lead
roles were Steve 'Mango' Molyneux, Peter 'Kiwi Fruit'
White, Mark 'The Arm' Mascal, Chris 'Passion Fruit'
Eardley, and Gary 'The System' Malaghan.

Guilded
Petition
Liverpool Guild Executive
are petitioning students to
support their decision to
withhold half their
affiliation fees. Guild
Executive member Mike
Brennan refuted rumours
that they were trying to get
themselves expelled from
NUS. He claimed they were
'definately not
disaffiliating'. They received
a telephone call from Ulster
University and a
Polytechnic Students
Union, whose NUS fee had
been upped from £18,000
to £27,000. Ulster Union
said they were going to
refuse to pay the excess.
None Over
The Eight
Only 8 people turned out
for the repeated R C S Street
Collection last Saturday,
but they still managed to
raise £250 for Rag. The
event was re-scheduled
after a poor attendance the
previous week when 30
students took part in the
Collection.
Treble
Twenty
The RCS 'One million and
one' darts was won by the
'Rest of the World' side
who defeated Physics at
6.30am on Monday
morning, after playing for
over 60 hours. Star of the
side was Chris Shaw of
Chemistry.
Mascotry
Madness
About 25 Q M C students
raided the RCS office on
Wednesday afternoon in an
unsuccessful attempt to
recapture Mary, their
mascot, which is currently
in the possession of RCSU.
Being unable to find Mary,
the students removed a
number of Q M C signs from
the Office and attempted to
steal Fagin, the RCS Rag
mascot. RCS VP Jackie
Peirce remonstrated with
the Q M C students and told
them that to steal Fagin
would constitute theft since
it is not violate. Miss Peirce
rang IC Union office and
reported the arrival of the
group of students. Guy
Perry contacted the
Security office, and then
brought about ten members
of Karate club from
Southside gym to the RCS
office. Miss Peirce
persuaded the Q M C
students that they would
have to meet certain
demands, such as a blood
donation, in order to
retrieve Mary. They finally
agreed to this but
commented that, if the
demands were
unreasonable, RCSU would
be 'for it'. The students
then left the office
peacefully. Miss Peirce will
be writing to Q M C Union to
inform them of the
conditions which they must
meet.
Slightly earlier in the
afternoon, three people had
entered IC Union office and
asked to speak to someone
from RCSU. They claimed
to be from London Student
newspaper, but were not
carrying writing materials
and did not know the
name, or the sex, of the
Editor. It became clear that
they were Q M C students
when they recognised Mr
Keith Garwood, a senior
administrator at QMC, who
was involved in a
discussion with Union
President Carl Burgess and
Deputy President Dave
Kingston.
In a seperate incident on
Wednesday a man came
into the Union office and
asked to see 'Mike'. He
explained that he was on
an army initiative course
and had been instructed to
meet 'Mike' in the IC Union
Office. 'Mike' is a four-foot
micrometer,' the mascot of
Imperial College Union.
