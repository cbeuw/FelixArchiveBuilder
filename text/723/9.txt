Anyone passing the RCA
recently can't have missed
the incongruous sight of
two Christmas trees
agitating in a washing
machine and another being
rotated by a bakery mixer.
This blatent misuse of '
conifers is intended to
attact you to the Art in
Norway Today exhibition
which continues until the
8th December.
The exhibition features the
rev
work of thirteen artists and
the number is yet another
reminder of the legendary
Scandanavian
depressiveness which is
apparent in the vast
majority of the pieces on
show. All the work is
abstract with the painting
ranging from dark brown
and suicidal to the
obsenely flourescent with
plenty of drivel between.
Thankfully there is little of

Against the Wall
1982-83-
Ellen Bang
I've been bombarded with
various unsolicited and
rubbishy books lately; here
are three of them...
The short timers by
Gustav Hasford is yet
another nasty Vietnam
book with lots of blood,
guts n' gore, trying to
shock all us bourgeois
readers into feeling guilty
about a stupid American
war. Just 'cos its got street
cred, thats no excuse for
bad writing, unintelligible
book s
plot and boring characters.
I pity the author having to
go though all that twice -
once in Nam and once on
paper.
Published by Javelin is a
collection of 'funny' radio
and TV comedy scripts, put
together by ex-Goodies
Graeme Garden and Bill
Oddie. These are no-where
near as brilliant as they
sound on record and
certainly not worth shelling
out £1.95 for.
The last and worst book is
the 'it's art because I threw
the paint 20 feet with one
hand behind my back'
school, though some
comes close, and one or
two do have the touch of
genius. Upstairs there is a
display of complex yet
uninspiring glassware but
the most impressive aspect
is the very high standard of
sculpture. All in all it is well
worth a visit, it's free and
just two minitues walk from
College. Just make sure
you're cheerful before yo
go in. For those who don't
want to look too hard for
an underlying metaphore
keep your eyes peeled for a
painting called 'drug
orgasm'.
another Javelin one - called
Comet Catastrophe by
Roger Sutherland. It takes
120 pages to ramblingly
propose the theory that
major disasters and
moments of mass hysteria
are caused by the close
proximity of Halley's
Comet.In another 76 years
it'll probably be a
collector's item.
The performance of King
Lear at the Almeida in
Islington begins a short
season of plays that were
well received on the
Edinburgh Fringe. This
production by the Kick
Theatre Company, a
professional ensemble with
strong connections with the
Central School of Speech
and Drama, was universally
acclaimed in Edinburgh by
both critics and audiences
alike, which in itself is a
major achievement.
According to the
programme notes, Kick
Theatre 'specialises in the
innovative production of
classic works', and this
intention can certainly be
seen in their version of
'King Lear'. None of the
cast left the stage during
the performance—when not
involved in the action they
sat around the edge and
watched, or remained
motionless at the top of the
three large step-ladders
which together with a chair
formed the only scenery.
'The storm scene was
played with two or three
spotlights and two sets of
extremely loud kettle
drums, while the actors
dipped their heads in
buckets of water in case
the audience still hadn't got
the message.
There is a fine borderline
between innovation and
gimmickry, and it can be all
too easy for inventive
direction to degenerate into
cleverness for cleverness'
sake rather than adding
something worthwile to the
script. Here, a combination
of intelligent direction and
the excellent acting of
(most of) the cast help to
BY FAR THE BEST...

save the production from
this danger. I found it easy
to grasp the intricacies of
the plot, whereas some
other productions have
been rather more difficult
to follow—and so the
imaginative staging seems
to pay off.
The Kick Theatre King
Lear closes at the Almeida
Theatre (Almeida St.
Islington ) on Saturday Nov
30th.
Alan Ayckbourn's Bedroom
Farce can be extremely
funny. He has taken the
infamous plot of bed-
swapping and constructed
a play on the theme. The
radically different
characters indulge in a
stunning interplay, ignoring
reality and sinking deeper
into muddle and mayhem,
to emerge truimphant and
happy (ever after).
Imperial College Dramatic
Society have developed an
interesting, if not
imaginative
production of
this farce under
the more
muscle strain,and his wife
Jan (Ros Benster), an ex-
lover of Trevor. Trevor's
parents, Ernest and Delia
(John Haslam and Vivenne
Inkster) are a typically
normal, middle aged,
middle class, demobbed
couple. They present a
contrast to the fourth pair,
Malcolm and Kate (Ciaron
Hassett and Sara Townson)
who are young, newly
housed, over keen to sort
out their lives, but
extremely hassled.
All the acting is
1
good, but I was
disappointed
with the
than competent direction of
Nikki Scott. The set is
good. The action is set in
three bedrooms and
involves four couples.
Trevor and Susannah
(Simon Lewis and Vanessa
Dodge), a young, trendy
and way out pair, have a
troubled marriage. They
make life unbearable for
Nick (John Burgess) who is
bed-ridden with dorsal
characters. I felt that Ernest
was not sufficiently ex-
army and Jan was not
sufficiently severe. But all
told, ICDS's production of
Bedroom Farce will provide
a good evening's
entertainment for a mere
£1.50. I recommend that
you see it on December 4,
5, 6 or 7 at 8.00pm. Watch
out for Nick's battle with
his Book!
