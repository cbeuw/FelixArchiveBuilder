The Union
For the last two months the
future of the Union
Building has dominated
Union Officer's
conversation and the news
pages of FELIX. Weird and
wacky schemes for the
Union have been suggested
by Sherfield beauraucrats
and Union Officers but in
the end it took Prof Ash to
see sense. It is obvious that
the Union needs a room to
hold parties in. It is
sensible that students
should control the Union
Bar.
The threat to the Union is
still not over though.
Biology are (as reported in
FELIX last week) intending
to move out of Ashurst
Lodge gradually and also
want to gradually move the
staff back to London. This
means that in a few years
the department will need
more room on campus and
they will start moves to
take over the Union again.
College has been muttering
about moving the Union
from Beit since 1982. Next
time Biology ask, they may
receive some of the Union.
It is vital that Carl Burgess,
Union President, gets an
agreement from College
about the long term future
of the Union so that we can
plan how to develop the
Union.
Security
Over the last few weeks
numerous handbags,
purses etc have stolen from
parts of the College.
Professional thieves know
that students leave valubles
lying about so don't leave
things lying about unless
you want them to be stolen.
Southside
Having tried Southside Bar
— The Sequel (the wine
bar next to Southside) I
can recomend it
thoroughly. The pizzas are
excellant value and you can
phone in orders (int 3286)
and takeaway if you want.
Rag Record
Several weeks ago there
was something about a go-
go record being sold for
Rag. The person selling
this is in Pet Eng 1 and not
the department stated.
Jobs
Kathy has just told me she
has a list of jobs for people
wanting to work this
Christmas. Go and see her
if you're interested.
Normans
It seems that nobody is
eating at Norman's Snack
Bar on a Wednesday
evening. Please support
this venture if you play
sport. You can only get
boring Mars bars at
Harlington. Why not eat at
Norman's rather than
Harlington.
FELIX
There won't be a FELIX
next Friday. Instead there
will be an extra-special
issue on the last
Wednesday of term. The
deadline for letters, sport
etc will still be 1.30pm
Monday.

A Slagging
A Complete Condemnation
of the IC Union Sabbaticals
by the IC Badminton Club
'What a bunch of wallies!'
(A quote from one of the
badminton club players.)
Once again, the Union
Sabbaticals have made a
complete cock-up of what
is one of their most basic
duties—the booking of
minibuses. So, let this be a
warning to all you club
captains, especially the
'unimportant clubs' ie
badminton (or at least
that's the impression that
the sabbaticals gave us);
even after giving three
weeks notice of a minibus
booking, don't ever actually
trust the union!
The Story
Our badminton club
captain was told by
Quentin to collect the van
from Budget Car/Van Hire,
in Earls Court. Accordingly
we left IC at 11.00am to
walk to Earl's Court to
collect the van, arranging
to pick up the other players
at IC at 12.00am.
On arriving at Budget,
the brunette behind the
desk denied all knowledge
of an IC booking—all their
vans being fully booked
until the end of the month.
Unabashed, we tried the
blonde, but she too denied
all knowledge. Panic. We
tried phoning the Union
Office-Quentin wasn't in,
but Cathy confirmed that
we should have had a
booking with Budget. We
decided to head back to
the Union Office, as there
didn't seem to be any
'spare' vans in sight.
Back at the Union at
11.50am the refrain of the
day seemed to be
'Quentin's returning in five
minutes'. Unfortuntely, one
and half hours later, this
refrain had lost some of its
appeal. So, as Carl had
gone home to visit mummy
as he was ill, we were
forced (in sheer
desperation) to turn to
Dave, the deputy president,
for help. To our immense
surprise, Dave actually
acted— picked the Union
van bookings file and
studied it very intensely.
However, as this course of
action wasn't very
forthcoming, he turned his
attention to a different
source—the yellow pages.
Several phone calls later he
managed to locate a hire
company with a spare
transit van. This was
1.30pm, and we were told
to collect the van in an
hour. Hurray—we might
actually get there. So, over
to Battersea, to eventually
collect the van at 3.00pm.
All went well, until we
reached the first junction
on leaving the van hire
firm. The van stalled.
Puzzled, we restarted the
engine, and continued as
far as the next junction,
where the van stalled again.
Several stalls later we
reached IC to pick up the
rest of the team, (only three
and half hours late, with
the prospect of reaching
Nottingham on time (ie in a
hour's time) fairly unlikely!
However even the least
mechanically minded
players in the team could •
perceive that when the van
stalled at every set of traffic
lights/junction that there
must be some 'minor' fault.
But the badminton team is
comprised of keen players,
we all refused point blank
to abandon the minibus,
and continued on a rather
slow journey out of
London. Luckily the M1
part of the journey was
somewhat more peaceful
mostly due ot the lack of
traffic lights.
Next trouble: the minibus
refused to start on
Saturday morning-solution,
call out the AA, whilst two
kind parents take the
badminton players to the
University Sports hall. The
AA man was able to fix the
minibus so that we'd get
back to London, the main
trouble being the choke,
but this was partially solved
by having somebody with
free hands to operate it
whilst we were driving.
Luckily for us, that was
the last peice of trouble
that we encountered min-
bus wise..unfortunatley the
badminton troubles weren't
as easily solved as the
badminton report will
explain
Conclusion
The Union Sabbaticals
made a total mess of this
duty. Indeed, Quentin F
