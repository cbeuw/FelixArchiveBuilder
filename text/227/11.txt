OUR CUP

T H E W E A T H E R , the organisation
and the excitement all lived up to the
usual high standard at last Satuday's
Hyde Park Relay. The overall hon-
ours went to Edinburgh University
who carved 89 seconds off the record
to take the Sir Roderick H i U C u p on
its farthest journey north to date.
Although lacking any real " stars "
Leeds, the holders, were pre-race fav-
ourites after their recent win in the

Q u e e n M o t h e r , I . C . water nolo team
lost t o fheir arch-rivals VJC. by 5 goals
to 3. T h e Q u e e n Mother, who was
visiting the University U n i o n , saw a
fierce game in which the U . C . t e a m
made it a hat trick o f victories over
I.C. this season.
The U . C . team contains three
U . L . U . first team players, b u t i n spite
of that they are p r o b a b l y little better
than o u r team. H o w e v e r they h e l d
a considerable p s y c h o l o g i c a l a d v a n -
tage already h a v i n g t w o single-goal
victories b e h i n d them.
I.C. started by p l a y i n g defensively
but this plan misfired as U . C . soon
scored b y a l o b b e d goal. I n the
second quarter the opponents, n o
doubt inspired b y the R o y a l p a t r o n -
age, scored a g a i n t o go 2-0 up. T h e
college team then came o u t of their
defensive stupor a n d centre f o r w a r d

I . C . F i v e s team h a d their seconu
victory o f the season a fortnight ago.

place o n o u r h o m e court at H a m p -
stead.
O u r first pair made short w o r k of
both their pairs, amassing almost
enough points to call it a d a y there
a n d then. T h e weaker second p a i r
had little difficulty i n g a i n i n g the
necessary points f o r victory.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y U . C . then scored
three q u i c k goals as I . C . c r u m b l e d .
H o w e v e r , i n the closing stages, the c o l -
lege team p u l l e d themselves together
a n d p u l l e d back to a m o r e respectable
score o f 5-3. T h e m a i n difference
between the teams was the superior
shooting power of the U . C . team.
2nds SWAMP U.C.
On Saturday 12th February,
I.C. 2nd X I met U.C. in the
U.L.U. Reserves Cup at Harling-
ton. Although heavy rain had
been falling all week, the pitch
was in great condition. U.C. kick-
ed off, started at a surprisingly
fast pace, and came close to scor-
ing in this early phase of the
game.
G r a d u a l l y the strength - a n u e x p e r i -
ence o f the I.C. team t o l d its tale a n d
th'v began to d o m i n a t e the game.
T n e home team eventually scored

and he i n turn sent W h i t t l e a w a y w i t h
a great through ball a n d he finished
the m o v e i n great style.
A f t e r this opening goal, I . C . never

prise w h e n they increased their lead.

w h i c h he accepted gratefully.
A f t e r the interval, the game became
m o r e even, a n d H e w a r d i n e i n the I . C .
goal was called u p o n to m a k e some
d a r i n g saves w h i c h were competently
executed. I . C . increased their lead

I T W A S A N equally successful day
for our only other soccer team left
in the cup competition. I . C . 6ths (the
soccer clubs answer to (frolicking
Ragins) beat West H a m seconds (Tech
not F . C . of course) by 7 goals to four.
T h e journey t h r o u g h to the final
was n o t always as easy as the score
might suggest. F o r the first h a l f - h o u r
the h o n o u r s were even, I . C . left half
B r i a n H a l l sending t w o unstoppable
shots into the top o f the net f r o m the
edge o f the penalty area. H o w e v e r
I.C.'s defences, i n spite of backs West
a n d W a l t o n , (motto : they shall n o t
pass), were equally u n l u c k y a n d the
score b e c a m e 2-2.
T h e rest o f the game went o u r w a y ,
w i t h the score leaping to 5-2, a n d I . C .

of the opponents near the end proved
a turning p o i n t , f o r after thai the
