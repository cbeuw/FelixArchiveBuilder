IN ICl
Engineers in the chemical industry
can fairly claim to face a wider range
of interesting problems than in any
other industry. ICl is in the forefront
of the chemical industry and offers
virtually unlimited variety of opportunity in design, development, production,
research, and many forms of industrial management. ICl gives each engineer
the chance to develop his technical and managerial abilities and—
equally important—offers unlimited prospects for advancement.
Further information is given in
Careers for Engineers and Careers for C h e m i c a l Engineers—two leaflets in a series published
by ICl for the information of engineers, chemists, physicists, mathematicians and statisticians
who are considering a career in industry.
