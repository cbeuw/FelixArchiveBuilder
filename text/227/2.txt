F R O M M O N D A Y to Friday last
week, I.C. Gilbert and Sullivan Society

cast being ably and charmingly com-
pleted by women from the various
London music colleges.

B u t it helps
A degree helps, because in the Royal Navy today, a
degree count;. As a graduate you are eligible to
enter the Royal Navy as a Seaman, Engineer, Supply
and Secretariat or Instructor Officer.
Mind you, there's more to it than being academic.
The work is demanding, is certainly different, and
calls for intelligence as well as education; for charac-
ter as well as a degree. As an Engineer Officer, you
have the responsibility for the efficiency and success
of startlingly advanced equipment: the complex
electronic heart of every fighting ship for example.
Or you could be working with nuclear reactors, gas
turbines, computers and so on. On the other hand,
as -a Seaman Officer you could have your own
command in your late twenties.
Promotion prospects are excellent. You have an
exciting, varied life, with world-wide travel, sport,
and- enjoy a high professional status.
Above all you're involyed in what is perhaps the
most important job is the world: front line preser-
vation of peace.
UiJrerjity Cadetjhljw are open to young men be-
tween 17J and 23; men either about to go to Univer-
sity or C A T . or those already doing a full time
course. You could have your fees paid and draw
officer's pay and allowances.
Acquaintance visits. To give you a taste of what life is
like in the Royal Navy you can attend a 7-week
workshop course held at.the Royal Naval Engineer-
ing College, Plymouth during the summer vacaiion,
or a one-week visit to a Naval port in ihe South.

Notice-board
review
A L L Recreational Clubs Committee
notices may be removed to Southside
next term. This is one of the possible
solutions to the problem of notice-
board space in the U n i o n , suggested
by Council member Pete Finch, who
is carrying out a full investigation of
the problem, the findings of which
will be put before the next Council
meeting.
B a s i c a l l y , there is n o t e n o u g h
n o t i c e - b o a i d space i n the U n i o n , n o r
is there e n o u g h space t o extend the
existing boards, a n d f u r t h e r ones must
be i n t r o d u c e d i n t o Southside. It has
not yet been decided exactly w h i c h
clubs w i l l be m o v e d ; i t m a y be the
w h o l e of S C C o r R C C , o r a p a r t of
each, b u t it is u n l i k e l y that A C C w i l l
be m o v e d o u t of the U n i o n since it
has stronger connections w i t h the
U n i o n (bar).
