Greater freedom for Social
Clubs Committee from the con-
trol of Council is proposed in a
motion to be voted on at the next
meeting of SCC.
The motion, proposed by Pete
Ruhemann, Chairman of Com-
munist Society, if accepted by
both S C C and Council would
provide that the SCC be able to
alter its own standing orders-
provided the powers of neither
Council or the IC Union Execut-
ive are affected.
