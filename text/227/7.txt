Hermann Bondi Talks to Felix
Famous mathematician of King's
talks about his work and views
to Chris Cooper
Professor Hermann Bondi, FRS, FRAS,
was born in Vienna, took his M A at
Trinity, Cambridge, is now Professor of
Mathematics at King's, London, and by
virtue of his frequent recent visits to IC, de-
serves the title of Visiting Professor here.
Two weeks ago I interviewed him in his
tiny office at King's, shamelessly demand-
ing potted pronouncements of his views on
cosmology, religion and education. Here is
part of that interview.
Hoyle's Steady-state Theory
Q: W h a t are y o u r views o n H o y l e ' s a b a n d o n -
ment of the steady-state theory, at least f o r the
l o c a l universe?
A : W e l l I have disagreed w i t h H o y l e f o r a n u m -
ber o f years on the w h o l e s i t u a t i o n here. I h a v e
always felt that the steady state theory was a very
good guess i n the sense that it was a very s i m p l e
m o d e l . It m a y w e l l be that we have been d r i v e n
f r o m this very simple p o s i t i o n . I then see n o
point i n trying to m a i n t a i n it i n a very c o m p l i -
cated w a y o v e r a l l as he d i d w i t h N a r l i k a r , or i n
some still w i d e r w a y as he is considering n o w . T h e
o n l y advantage of the steady-state theory is its
s i m p l i c i t y . If the s i m p l i c i t y has" to be a b a n d o n e d
there are other m o d e ' s I w o u l d l o o k at first.
Q : W h a t were y o u r o r i g i n a l reasons f o r adopt-
i n g the t h e o r y ?
A : B a s i c a l l y the p o i n t of s i m p l i c i t y . If y o u
have a changing U n i v e r s e then y o u must c o n t e m -
plate . . . a c h a n g i n g physics. I t h i n k that m a n y
o f u s — o f course H o y l e has been extremely f o r c e f u l
i n this h i m s e l f i n m u c h of his w o r k — m a n y of us
be'ieve there is a strong l i n k between l o c a l P h y s i c s
a n d the U n i v e r s e at large, a n d the difficulty of
k n o w i n g h o w P h y s i c s has changed i n these c i r -
cumstances is very great indeed, because n a t u r a l l y
all our present k n o w l e d g e is gained at w h a t is a
m o m e n t i n the l i f e of the U n i v e r s e . T h e r e f o r e
there are i n n u m e r a b l e possibilities f o r c h a n g e s —
o n l y a very few have been explored. O n e of t h e m
is a change i n the constant of gravitation d u r i n g
the life of the U n i v e r s e , but there is r e a l l y n o
l i m i t and Oi course one k n o w s f r o m the h i s t o r y o f
Physics that it w i l l not be the nth possibility
investigated that w i l l t u r n out to be p a r t i c u l a r l y
f r u i t f u l , but the ( n + l ) t h . If the universe is
c h a n g i n g ; o n the other h a n d i f the universe is u n -
c h a n g i n g . . . this is a typical m o m e n t i n the life
of the U n i v e r s e and we can use o u r physics w i t h
confidence. O f course this m a y be quite w r o n g
but it is a very g o o d t h i n g to t r y as a first shot.
Micro-macro link
Q : D o y o u see a n y i m m e d i a t e stimulus to cos-
m o l o g y f r o m the sort of elementary particle
physics that goes o n at I C ?
A : W h a t y o u are a s k i n g m e is p r a c t i c a l l y to be
a soothsayer and this is very difficult. A s y o u
k n o w , e v e r y t h i n g i n elementary p a r t i c l e physics
is based on the idea of L o r e n t z covariance. O n
the other h a n d the universe as a w h o l e is certainly
not L o r e n t z convariant. W e k n o w that i f I get
an isotropic v i e w of the universe a r o u n d me, i f I
were m o v i n g at a h i g h speed t h r o u g h this p o s i -
t i o n , I w o u l d see a n a n i s o t r o p i c v i e w , so that the
universe determines a velocity. I l i k e to say that
what the general p r i n c i p l e of relativity states is
that as yet n o e x p e r i m e n t has been performed that
reveals this c o s m o l o g i c a l l y prefered velocity, but
of course such a n experiment m a y be performed
one day. S o m e elementary particle processes m a y
be related to this c o s m i c velocity.
Q : I w o u l d have thought the l o c a l velocity of
light was the velocity i n question.
A : N o , n o , this is not the velocity of light at a l l ,
— [ C o o p e r subsides i n b e w i l d e r m e n t ] — l o o k , w h e n
we l o o k r o u n d us, we see the velocity-distance
relation operating, i n whatever d i r e c t i o n we are
l o o k i n g . If we were m o v i n g t h r o u g h o u r present
p o s i t i o n w i t h three-quart'.rs. c f the velocity of
l i g h t , a n d l o o k e d at the universe a r o u n d us, then
at the m o m e n t of m o v i n g through o u r present p o -
s i t i o n , we w o u l d see the same k i n d of t h i n g we see
h e r e — t h a t we see f r o m o u r o w n present state of
m o t i o n — b u t o f course, the red-shirts a n d blue-
shifts a n d intensities w o u l d be rather different
a n d they w o u l d not give us a n isotropic picture.
W e w o u l d , after a l l , l o o k i n g f o r w a r d see lots m o r e
blue'-shifts a n d l o o k i n g b a c k w a r d s ; very m u c h
enhanced red-shifts. Therefore there is a definite
velocity n o t v i o l e n t l y different f r o m o u r a c t u a l
velocity, w h i c h is the c o s m o l o g i c a l l y prefered one.
Q : It w o u l d be l i k e the M i c h e l s o n - M o r l e y ex-
periment but w i t h a positive result ?
A : It w o u l d be this k i n d of t h i n g , exactly, a n d
we w o u l d expect this to c o m e out c f any experi-
ments w h i c h h a d very strong cosmic l i n k s different
f r o m the l i n k s that m a y underlie M a c h ' s p r i n c i p l e
o r s u c h a t h i n g . N o w y o u c a n i m a g i n e m a n y things
l i k e that, f o r e x a m p l e there have been investiga-
tions o f n e u t r i n o degeneracy o f the n e u t r i n o back-
g r o u n d ; n o w of course, the neutrinos here that
pass t h r o u g h us f r o m a l l the stars i n the U n i v e r s e
w i l l not f o r m a L o r e n t . ' convariant set. and any-
t h i n g very strongly affected by that, a n y nuclear
reaction, w o u l d reveal this. I ' m not a believer i n
an aether, but I t h i n k it is very h a r d to say that
there aren't neutrinos a n d anti-neutrinos r u s h i n g
r o u n d i n a m a n n e r w h i c h contains this preferred
velocity.
Q : W h a t actually is y o u r present l i n e o f re-
search?
A : It's a l m o s t entirely i n theory o f g r a v i t a t i o n ,
general relativity, such p r o b l e m s as g r a v i t a t i o n a l
waves, energy transfer by g r a v i t a t i o n , configura-
tions of h i g h g r a v i t a t i o n a l potential and so o n .
Q : Is this a l l d o n e o n paper?
A : A l l o n paper, entirely.
Q : H o w does one become a cosmologist ?
A : W e l l , I don't t h i n k one s h o u l d become a cos-
m o l o g i s t ; I t h i n k there are very few people w h o
have m a d e a r e a l l y w o r t h w h i l e c o n t r i b u t i o n to
c o s m o l o g y w h o specialised a l l their lives i n this
subject. V e r y m a n y i m p o r t a n t contributions have
c o m e f r o m people w h o ' v e been theoretical p h y s i -
cists i n other directions, or astronomers i n ether
directions, a n d then have made occasional c o n t r i -
b u t i o n s ; that k i n d of t h i n g . . . I t h i n k theoretical
a s t r o n o m y is a very g o o d field of e m p l o y m e n t for
a theoretical physicist, and if he does theoretical
a s t r o n o m y he m a y go over a n d once or twice
w r i t e a paper o n c o s m o l o g y .
Science and Religion
Q : Y o u ' r e g o i n g to be t a l k i n g to the H u x l e y
Society o n " S c i e n c e & R e l i g i o n . " W h a t lines w i l l
y o u be t a l k i n g o n ?
A : W e l l , I o b v i o u s l y don't want to talk too m u c h
about it n o w , but I feel very strongly that there's
a hangover f r o m the nineteenth century a b o u t ' t h e
conflict between the results of science, and what
the r e l i g i o n s c l a i m as facts. N o w , that, I t h i n k ,
has largely evaporated because theologians have
b e c o m e so v e r y m u c h m o r e flexible. I don't t h i n k
there's a n y serious conflict i n that d i r e c t i o n at a l l ;
o n the other h a n d , there is a g o o d deal of conflict
between the methods of science w i t h their essential
belief i n h u m a n f a l l i b i l i t y , a n d the sometimes
arrogant p u b l i c c l a i m s of revealed religion, a l -
t h o u g h I have n o q u a r r e l w i t h a modest f o r m of
p r i v a t e r e l i g i o n .
Implementation of Robbins
Q : I read y o u r article i n Isis expressing enthusi-
astic support f o r the R o b b i n s report. W h a t were
y o u r reasons f o r w e l c o m i n g R o b b i n s ?
A : W e l l , i t seems to m e that we are i n an ex-
t r a o r d i n a r i l y fortunate p o s i t i o n . W e have an
e n o r m o u s g r o w t h of desire for education, i n c l u d i n g
h i g h e r university education, c o m i n g very m u c h
at the same t i m e as the e c o n o m y is m o v i n g into a
phase where m o r e a n d m o r e h i g h l y educated
people are r e q u i r e d , a n d it is not necessary for
these t w o t h i n g s to m o v e i n phase. W e k n o w ,
f o r example, that countries l i k e India are full of
u n e m p l o y e d graduates, a n d we k n o w of other
countries where there w o u l d be great openings for
graduates, but there are not enough people c o m i n g
f o r w a r d to the universities. W e l l , it seems to me
that this great g r o w t h of desire together w i t h the
great g r o w t h o f o p p o r t u n i t y must be m a t c h e d by
university traditions. I t h i n k that lack of desire
is responsible f o r standards being n o higher than
they were i n the past a n d that even w h e n reaching
a m u c h larger f r a c t i o n of the p o p u l a t i o n , there's
not the slightest reason to believe that " more
means worse " as the opponents of R o b b i n s have
so often said.
Q : D o y o u t h i n k the recommendations of
R o b b i n s are b e i n g i m p l e m e n t e d f a r enough ?
A : W e l l , of course, there are m a n y aspects of
this that I a m quite unqualified to speak about. I
m e a n this vexed question of the position of the
Colleges of E d u c a t i o n , where the G o v e r n m e n t has
decided against R o b b i n s . I can't speak about this,
I don't k n o w either side of the question w e l l
e n o u g h . I n the universities m y feeling is that
the same t h i n g holds back the universities as holds
back everything i n the country's e c o n o m y , n a m e l y ,
the b u i l d i n g industry is not as productive as it
ought to be, a n d that therefore it is very hard to
get sufficient results to be able to a c c o m m o d a t e
a l l that s h o u l d be a c c o m m o d a t e d , a n d to be able
tv do so efficiently.
Q t W o u l d y o u support the idea of a hierarchy
w i t h i n universities so that O x b r i d g e w o u l d have a
privileged position?
A : W e l l , I ' m c e r t a i n l y v i o l e n t l y against a n y t h i n g
that ossifies a p o s i t i o n , because i n the m i n d s of
certain schoolmasters the o p i n i o n hangs o n that
O x b r i d g e , because it was pre-eminent fifty years
ago, must be pre-eminent n o w , a n d that that
s h o u l d i n any w a y be codified f o r the future w h e n
it's n o longer true n o w , seems to me quite a b s u r d .
N o , I l i k e a g o o d deal o f c o m p e t i t i o n a n d free
trade between the universities; if we have academic
f r e e d o m , then at least we can experiment a n d find
out.
