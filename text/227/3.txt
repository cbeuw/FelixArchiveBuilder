" What you get out of it de-
pends on what you put in !" This
quote from Tom Lehrer was Dr.
R. W. Edwards' parting remark
at his talk to the i l . G . Wells
Society on Monday, February
14th, and epitomises the lively
style which he used in his inter-
esting talk on "Water Pollution
Problems in Britain."
With most of the rainfall in the
north and west, and the lack of
any national grid for water, the
south-east centres of population
are using water as many as three
or four times before it gets to the
sea.
T h e r e is a certain unpleasantness
about the idea that the water one
drinks m a y also have been d r u n k b y
three other people, b u t it is some
compliment to the effectiveness o f
sewage processes that w e cannot t e l l —
in this country at least !
A t a c o n v e n t i o n a l sewage w o r k s the
MComing sewage is ground up, then
settled, and the liquid is decanted off
and sprayed on to filter beds where
a variety of micro-organisms oxidise
organic matter, and most of the re-
maining solids are filtered off. A
tertiary stage using alum to precipi-
tate phosphate and chlorination is
sometimes used.
The sludge is one of the worst
problems, being difficult to get rid of,
especially in industrial areas where it
absorbs an incredible amount of
chemicals, which render it useless as a
fertiliser.

word meaning 'matchmaking' and
this was the basis of an informal
party held at Chelsea College on
Sunday 13th Feb.
The evening was organised by
members of Imperial, Chelsea
and Battersea Colleges' Jewish
Societies, but the entry was not
restricted to students only.

each set of answers ensured that
People i n the same categories w o u l d
be suitable partners f o r d a n c i n g , etc.,

O f course the questions brought

UFO's at Wellsoc
REPORTS of UFOs (Uniden-
tified Flying Objects) have been
made for several hundred years,
though reports have been far
more frequent this century, and
especially in the last 25 years, but
this is partly accounted for by
the increased ease of communica-
tion.
Many of the reports come from
pilots and truck drivers and other
such people who are required by
their occupations to watch the
sky or to be regularly out at
night.
T h e suggestion that they m a k e t h e
reports as a joke c a n often be dis-
counted s i m p l y because such reports
get a v e r y scathing l o c a l press. It is
u n l i k e l y to be a figment of their i m -
agination as there is c o r r e l a t i o n of
detail i n reports f r o m C h i n a , S o u t h
A m e r i c a , a n d a l l parts o f the w o r l d ,
and this is especially r e m a r k a b l e w h e n
the observers l i v e i n isolated c o m -
munities w i t h n o exposure to science

SEX
at General
Studies
SEX is a subject near to all our
hearts, but when it is coupled
with religion interest wanes. De-
spite this the General Studies lec-
ture given by Rev. Kenneth Greet
of the Methodist'Church was well
attended, no doubt drawn by that
single word title.
The speaker gave a lucid, well-
defined talk which neither
shocked nor produced anything
very new.
H e d i v i d e d his talk into three sub-
jects : p r o m o t i o n of conception, pre-
vention c f conception, a n d a b o r t i o n —
all of t o p i c a l interest. H e gave the
C h u r c h ' s v i e w o n artificial i n s e m i n a -
tion, saying that if it w a s b y the hus-
b a n d it was right, a n d if b y d o n o r
w r o n g .
O n other methods o f conception
p r o m o t i o n , such as the grafting of
o v a r y tissue to cure infertility, he said
they were right i f they enhanced the
essentially personal relationship of the
f a m i l y set-up
C o n s i d e r i n g the A b o r t i o n B i l l , he
said that was right that it s h o t ' d
safeguard h u m a n life, b u t that t w a
lives s h o u l d be considered, B T J
mother's being the m o r e i m p o r t a n t of
the t w o .
T h e h a l f - h o u r talk was f o l l o w e d b y
some attacking questions o n the ability
of the C h u r c h to l a y d o w n the l a w
on matters c o n c e r n i n g sex.
