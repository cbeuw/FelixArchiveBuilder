Structure of the stars
ON T U E S D A Y , 8th, Professor
Hermann Bondi of King's Col-
lege, spoke to RCS Astronomical
Society on the structure of the
stars, which are now generally ac-
cepted as the birthplace of the
elements beyond hydrogen.
Speaking lucidly and without
notes, the Professor began by
quoting Hoyle's statement that we
know more of what goes on in-
side the stars than inside a boil-
ing kettle.
F o r t y years a g o E d d i n g t o n p r o -
duced a w o r k a b l e theory o f the struc-
ture o f stars f r o m simple assumptions
r e g a r d i n g their c h e m i c a l u n i f o r m i t y ,
and t h e k n o w l e d g e that they a r e
gaseous i n nature. W i t h o u t k n o w -
ing a n y t h i n g o f t h e processes b y
w h i c h energy is released, h e was able
to derive a m a s s - l u m i n o s i t y r e l a t i o n
that accurately describes main-se-
quence stars, a n d t o calculate the
temperatures o f their centres. Stars
m o v e o i l ' the m a i n sequence w h e n
they begin to age, a n d h e l i u m a c -
c u m u l a t e s i n their centres ; they s w e l l ,
the temperature at their centres rises
and the h e l i u m is burnt to p o d u c e
heavier elements. B u t t h e energy
expenditure d e m a n d e d b y E d d i n g t o n ' s
relation cannot change ; whereas the
star's capital o f energy must eventu-
a l l y r u n o u t . T h e s m a l l e r ones b e -
c o m e white, a n d then b l a c k d w a r f s
supported entirely b y c o l d pressure ;
this w i l l be the fate o f o u r sun. T h e
larger ones s h r i n k further a n d further,
spin faster and faster and finally b l o w
themselves apart b y s i m p l e c e n t r i f u g a l
force. It is suspected that i f there
were n o a n g u l a r m o m e n t u m whatever
in t h e star (hardly conceivable), i t
w o u l d s h r i n k t o " a n a b s u r d l y s m a l l "

The exploitation of nuclear energy clearly necessitates the application of the most
advanced knowledge to ensure satisfactory performance from the materials involved.
Similarly, in conventional generation systems, significant improvements in the per-
formance of traditional materials can be achieved through basic and applied
research. The demand for electricity doubles every eight years and, at present, the
daily capital investment is around £1,500,000.
Therefore there is a continuing requirement for scientists of the highest calibre to
investigate problems such as the creep of metals, irradiation effects, corrosion, and
fracture processes. Young scientists with relevant research experience are partic-
ularly welcome. Much of the work is comparable with that carried out in universities
and close links are maintained with laboratories doing similar work. Publication of
research is actively encouraged, and so is the implementation of its results in the
operational field.
