Free Vote for President
The Case For
B E F O R E considering the advantages o(
electing President of Imperial College
Union by popular vote, there are three
important criticisms of the present
evolutionary method. Firstly, the Presid-
ent who is elected by a meeting of joint
Council must feel more responsible to
them than to the whole Union. This very
indirect method of election means that the
President seems far from the general body
of the Union.
s e c o n d l y this system of election tends to p r o -
duce a President f r o m the o l i g a r c h y w h i c h r u n s
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e U n i o n . T h i s is b a c k e d up b y
m o s t Presidents e v o l v i n g d i r e c t l y f r o m C o u n c i l
a n d not f r o m the U n i o n . Because of this too m a n y
m e m b e r s of the U n i o n do not k n o w o f the f u t u r e
President u n t i l they are presented to t h e m .
T h i r d l y , because of the system, candidates are
disuaded f r o m c o m i n g f o r w a r d . It is a s o r r y
state of affairs w h e n Presidents are elected u n -
opposed.
U L U is a p r i m e e x a m p l e o f w h a t happens
wheri (he members o f the U L U have h a r d l y a n y
say i n the elections of the P r e s i d e n t a n d the rest
of the executive. I n order that I C does n o t de-
generate as f a r as this, the President a n d Secretary
o f I C U n i o n must be elected by a p o p u l a r v o t e of
the U n i o n m e m b e r s .
T h e first advantage is that we w o u l d have a
democratic system f o r c h o o s i n g o u r most s e n i o r
m e m b e r . Secondly, a n d the m o r e i m p o r t a n t reason,
the President w o u l d be responsible to the w h o l e
U n i o n , w h o h a d elected h i m . C o n v e r s e l y the U n i o n
m e m b e r s w o u l d realise that the President m o r e
realistically represents t H e m i n h i s w o r k w i t h i n
a n d outside I C .
I n o r d e r to persuade the m a j o r i t y o f the U n i o n
to s u p p o r t t h e m , the candidates w o u l d have to or-
ganise a c a m p a i g n to m a k e themselves k n o w n ,
to s h o w their abilities a n d put f o r w a r d their v i e w s
to the w h o l e U n i o n . I doubt i f any candidate
w o u l d be elected o n grounds o f e m o t i o n . I n fact
p o t e n t i a l candidates w h o were not serious are
m o r e l i k e l y t o w i n over the relatively s m a l l J o i n t
C o u n c i l t h a n the s o l i d b u l k of the U n i o n .
B y e x e r c i s i n g their vote to choose the senior
m e m b e r of the U n i o n , m e m b e r s of I C U n i o n w i l l
be able to participate m o r e i n the U n i o n w h e n
they realise they c o u n t a n d their v o t e counts. In
this w a y I t h i n k that the a p a t h y w h i c h besets
U n i o n activities c o u l d be c u r b e d to the advantage
o f everyone.
E . F o r t u n e .
And Against
Created issues and inter-collegiate strife.
Are these teh grounds on which we want
to elect the President of I.C. Union? Do
we want candidates to have to think uo
slogans like "Cheaper Moonev Meals"
that are impossible to put into effect ? Do
we want the Mines vote to hold swav over
whether we have a President from Guilds
or RCS ?
A free vote f o r Presidency does n o t necessarily
m e a n that these w o u l d be the d e c i d i n g p o i n t s ,
but o n l y if issues l i k e these arose w o u l d it be a n y
different f r o m the present system, where the final
choice is made by C o u n c i l — w h i c h is n o m o t e of
a c l i q u e t h a n the H o u s e o f C o m m o n s .
T h e nature of the office makes it essential that
the President is someone of p r o v e n a d m i n i s t r a t i v e
a b i l i t y , w i t h tfte respect of those w i t h w h o m he
m u s t w o r k and those i n a u t h o r i t y , a n d w i t h a n
i n t i m a t e k n o w l e d g e o f the r u n n i n g o f the U n i o n .
T h e present system ensures that the person w h o
fulfils these conditions best w i l l be elected.
It is said that a great advantage of the proposed
change is that p o p u l a r Presidents w i l l result. I n
theory this is a n excellent point. B u t w h y are
people p o p u l a r ? Because of the above points?
O r because " he makes C o n s t i t u e n t U n i o n meet-
ings a l a u g h " or " he is a g o o d c e n t r e - f o r w a r d . "
T o b e c o m e p o p u l a r candidates w o u l d be forced to
canvass intensively for t w o or three m o n t h s before-
h a n d . T h i s w o u l d m e a n final year undergraduates
(who are at present the m a j o r i t y of candidates)
w o u l d not be prepared to stand. D o we want a
free vote w i t h s o m e of the best candidates unable
to s t a n d — r e s u l t i n g i n , perhaps, o n l y one candidate?
D o u s a l M c C r e a t h ( C i v i l E n g i n e e r i n g P G ) is a n
ex-President of the U n i v e r s i t y o f M a n i t o b a i n
C a n a d a . H e was elected by a free vote but is n o t
i n f a v o u r of this m e t h o d . " C a n d i d a t e s are forced
to m a k e r a s h promises w h i c h they cannot k e e p .
T h e y have to m a n u f a c t u r e reasons w h y they are
' d i f f e r e n t ' . " H e said also that n e a r l y a l w a y s the
election reduced to A r t s versus the Sciences, w i t h
the f o r m e r m o r e successful t h r o u g h greater n u m -
bers. H e , as a n engineer, belonged to a s m a l l
f a c u l t y a n d w o u l d p r o b a b l y not h a v e h a d a
serious chance but f o r e x a m failures r e m o v i n g
the t w o m a i n contenders. D o we never w a n t a
President f r o m M i n e s ?
P e o p l e w h o suggest that the present arrange-
m e n t is u n d e m o c r a t i c w o u l d be better e m p l o y e d
d o i n g their s t i r r i n g against the m e t h o d o f govern-
m e n t i n this c o u n t r y . A s the past has s h o w n ,
a P r i m e M i n i s t e r can stagger o n , even w h e n

have total d e m o c r a c y because the U n i o n is above

New Hostel for I.C.
Two students are so fed up with the ac-
comodation problem in this area that
they have decided that it is time to do
something about it. They propose to set
up a self-governing student residence
which would be similar in certain ways to
an American Fraternity. It is proposed that
it would be totally owned and administer-
ed bv the student residents although they
would like an affiliation with one of the
American fraternities, so that members of
their fraternity in London would be able
to stay at American ones, and vice versa,
during the summer vacations.

the students visit the different fraternities a n d
ctioOse the one w h i c h they w o u l d l i k e to b e l o n g
to. T h o s e that are selected f r o m these a p p l i c a t i o n s
are accepted o n p r o b a t i o n for six m o n t h s . A t the
e n d of this p e r i o d those that still w i s h to r e m a i n ,
have to be a p p r o v e d by the rest of the fraternity.
O n c e elected a person is a m e m b e r f o r life.
T h e fraternities are usually members of c h a i n s
w h i c h have units at different universities a l l over
