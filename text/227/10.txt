Gutteridge Cup
MOTSPUR
HERE WE COME
I.C. 11 - C.E.M. 3
by Bill Jenkins
It was a vocal, bloodthirsty and near alcoholic contingent of
C.E.M. supporters who turned out at Harlington last Wednesday. A
contingent who found themselves not only matched for support by
an I.C. party under the mob rule of Ken West but steadily silencea
as the I.C. fifteen quickly established their superiority and by virtue
of an 11â€”3 win entered the final of the Gutteridge Cup for the first
time for five years.

OUT OF SEASON
A T T H I S time o f the season the
boat c l u b does n o t race very often b u t
o u r t w o n o v i c e crews t o o k o n t w o
equivalent crews f r o m R e a d i n g U n i -
versity over a m i l e o n the T i d e w a y .
T h e first crew w o n their event b y
t w o lengths, b u t the second w a s not
so fortunate a n d lost by a m a r g i n o f
about five lengths. It w o u l d seem that
there is a great d i s p a r i t y between
these t w o crews a n d , at this time of
year, i t is strange that this s h o u l d be
so. T h e second crew lacks c o h e s i o n
a n d the first crew's r h y t h m leaves
s o m e t h i n g to be desired, but they d o
w o r k together better than the second.
These faults must be straightened
out before the H e a d o f the R i v e r
R a c e o n M a r c h 19, i f the anticipated
successes are to be realised.
