H A L L S O F RESIDENCE

H o m e f r o m h o m e o r
b o a r d i n g school ?
A D I R E C T I V E was recently issued in the South-
side halls of residence that all room furniture
must be returned to the positions it occupied
in the rooms at the beginning of the session.
T h i s arrangement is n o t . however, t h e o n e p l a n n e d
by the architect o f S o u t h s i d e — t h e same w h i c h
was enthusiastically praised b y T H E O B S E R -
V E R as the best student a c c o m m o d a t i o n i n
the country, a n d the same that was so p r o u d l y
exhibited t o Princess M a r g a r e t at the O p e n i n g
C e r e m o n y .
T h e layout o f the r o o m s p l a n n e d b y R i c h a r d
S h e p p a r d m a y n o t be to the l i k i n g o f us a l l ,
a n d a n u m b e r o f residents have chosen t o
adapt this " i d e a l " t o their o w n satisfaction.
H o w e v e r , a u n i v e r s a l l y - a c k n o w l e d g e d " n o n -
ideal " arrangement is n o w being i m p o s e d .
T h i s m o v e seems to be yet another infringement
u p o n the liberties o f residents i n I m p e r i a l
C o l l e g e h a l l s — t h e m a j o r i t y o f w h i c h seem
to arise i n Southside.
The Halls of Residence Committee needs to take
a fresh lock at the whole question of the
status of the halls. Is a room in hall to be
considered as the resident's home-from-home,
where he may—within reason—do as he
wishes, or a boarding-school mini-dormitory?
W h y s h o u l d o n e n o t be a l l o w e d t o introduce the
occasional overnight guest (some friends d o
have a habit o f suddenly a p p e a r i n g o n the
doorstep), to express one's i n d i v i d u a l i t y i n the
decoration o f one's r o o m ( a n d meet a n y e x -
pense thereby incurred), o r a d d such f u r n i s h -
ings as fridges, c o o k e r s a n d chairs, so l o n g
as such actions neither disturb ones n e i g h -
bours (noise), n o r alter the f a b r i c o f the
b u i l d i n g , n o r create difficulties f o r the clean-
i n g staff (safe electric w i r i n g ) ?
The second c o n d i t i o n — t o w a r d w h i c h c e r t a i n halls
Seem to be steadily progressing (regressing?)
•—leads one to wonder to what extent wardens
Should be " i n l o c o p a r e n t i s . " S h o u l d they
determine the m o r a l codes o f residents, f o r
instance? T h i s is b o u n d t o cause r e b e l l i o n
a m o n g the r a n k s , a n d residents w i l l , l i k e
schoolboys, secretively seek t o break the rules
for their o w n sake rather t h a n m o r e m a t u r e l y
f o l l o w a p r i v a t e l y - h e l d m o r a l code.
Congratulations
Sir.
I s h o u l d l i k e to congratulate
I . C . G i l b e r t a n d S u l l i v a n G r o u p
for a magnificent performance
last night o f b o t h " T r i a l " a n d
" P i n a f o r e . " E v e n t h o u g h this
was the first performance o f the
week, it w a s brisk, bright, c o l -
o u r f u l , w e l l acted, w e l l sung
(although I d i d n o t agree w i t h
some o f the m u s i c a l interpre-
tation), a n d generally excel-
lently presented.
T h e o n l y cause o f d i s a p -
pointment w a s the small n u m -
ber i n the audience, a c h a r a c -
teristic o f " first nights " at I . C . ,
u n f o r t u n a t e l y , b u t I ' m glad to
find that b o o k i n g s a r e heavier
t o w a r d s the e n d o f the week
I w o u l d encourage a l l w h o
c a n to see this p r o d u c t i o n . A
g o o d show deserves a g o o d a u -
dience.
Y o u r sincerely,
M i k e M c G u i r e . M e t . 3.
Why Silence
Sir.
T h e I C mass learned f o r the
first time i n the last issue o f
F E L I X o f actions w h i c h I f o r
or"\ w o u l d l i k e clarified. I
understand b y w o r d o f m o u t h
as w e l l as f r o m F E L I X c o l -
u - ,
i ' the <"werning b o a r d
of F E L I X i n general, a n d the
f o u r C o l l e s e Presidents i n par-
ticular, objected t o the c o n -
tinued use r" the two-pronged
f o r k C o l c u ^ - T ^ n o us as a n i n -
strument o f -destructive c r i t i -
cism. F i n e . I aeree that p u r e l y
destructive c r i t i c i s m seldom
achieves a result, even if this
were its intention, f o r it is
easily rejected, either o n the
m o r e e m o t i o n a l g r o u n d o f
back-stabbing, o r else b y " S o
w h a t w o u l d y o u d o , C o l c u t t -
Ignotus ? "
T h e point w h i c h still stands
is that, however bothersome,
destructive criticism o n l y arises
w h e n something is amiss, at
least i n the m i n d o f the critic.
If the p e o p l e / g r o u p s at w h o m
criticism w a s a i m e d regard such
c o m m e n t as pointless, w h y d o
they bother to w i s h t o suppress
it ? If it does have a genuine
point to m a k e , Should F E L I X
not be a l l o w e d t o voice i t , so
that it comes to general notice,
a n d , as is often the case, a n
answer must be written i n '.he
same issue ?
T h i s raises a second, m o r e
important, point. It seems that
the b o a r d of governors has
used its censorial powers s i m p l y
to protect itself f r o m a n o n y -
m o u s r e v i e w — A d r i a n F l e t c h e r
must have j u m p e d t h r o u g h a
h o o p h a v i n g been responsible
for C o l c u t t last year, t o n o w
d a m n it. I a n W i l l i a m s w a s t o l d
that h e m i g h t print either C o l -
cutt o r Ignotus. A s s e r t i n g the
generally h e l d p r i n c i p l e o f the
" f r e e d o m o f the p r e s s " h e
printed both. N o w h e m a y
print neither. S o , the respect-
ive, a n d , f o r their ability, l e -
spected authors w r i t e i n the
open, w h i c h need have little
effect u p o n their m a t e r i a l .
W h a t then has the b o a r d r e a l l y
achieved ; w h a t d i d they i n -
tend?
M y s u m m a r y m a y be u n -
k n o w i n g l y partial o r slanted,
m y facts m a y be a d r i f t — I ' d
feel easier i f this were s o — b u t
I t h i n k that there's a pair o f
b l i n k e r s o n F E L I X n o w .
In the last issue o f F E L I X ,
A d r i a n F l e t c h e r wrote that
it w o u l d need to b e a m a j o r
break i n c o m m u n i c a t i o n s f o r a
f e l l o w to be u n a b l e to chat w i t h
a U n i o n official. I think I C as
a w h o l e w o u l d perhaps like to
see a n explanatory chat n o w .

Crass Attack
D e a r M r . B l i s t e r i n g E d i t o r ,
I w a s a p p a l l e d t o read last
week i n y o u r P h a l l i c views
paper that y o u s h o u l d , perhaps
under the pressure of feeling
b o r e d , replace y o u r a n o m a l o u s
c o m m u n i s t (that is I g n o m i n -
i o u s — n o t O l d M u t t ) b y this
C r a s s C o o p e r .
Since I regard a n y attack o n
Pete F i n c h as a personal attack
o n myself, I w a s h o r r i f i e d t o
see this " S i m p l e " Styled, l o n g -
eared, pseudo sexed, intellec-
tually sicksocsec openly accuse
p o o r Pete o f n o t being c o m -
pletely fooled.
F u r t h e r m o r e , I h o p e that b y
all that is f a i r i n this w a y o f the
w o r l d that the a l m i g h t y A .
F l i c t o r m a y expose C o o p e r ' s
real name, so that I c a n j o i n
I g n o m i n i o u s a n d " P u s h y e r -
