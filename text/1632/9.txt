FILM
The top three
European Films
that aren’t
French
A
s much as I love
the more abstract/
pretentious cinema
offerings at any one
time, I can’t bloody stand French
films. I’m not saying that all
French films are bad – that would
be ridiculous. My argument,
which I would hope is at least
somewhat informed, is that the
French ‘style’ of filmmaking is
just something I cannot stand:
pretentious dialogue, a penchant
for lengthy, static shots, and a
weird fascination with narratives
focusing on young women falling
in love with old men. You may
have started it France, but the rest
of Europe is going to finish it:
The Hunt (2012)
Starting on a high,The Hunt is a
Danish film focusing on Hannibal
star Mads Mikkelsen who, when
falsely accused of molesting a
young girl at his primary school,
is made an outcast and a villain
in his local community. It is far
from the cheeriest film in the
world, but the sympathy it elicits
and the flawless performances of
the deeply complex characters
set it apart as a masterpiece. The
Scandinavians are just so bloody
good at this.
Bicycle Thieves (1948)
Bicycle Thieves is a classic Italian
film most often found on the
top ten lists of desperately elitist
film critics. Looking past this
however, it’s still rather good, and
what makes the film stand out is
the unique snapshot it gives us of
post-war Italy. The rather simple
story here simply serves, to me, as
an excuse to lose yourself in the
buzzing atmosphere of Italy just
after WWII.
Chico and Rita (2010)
Chico and Rita is a vibrant
and exciting Spanish/English
animated feature showcasing
the brilliant world of 1940s
Cuban jazz. From its unique and
gorgeous art style, to its music
and settings, Chico and Rita is
absolutely captivating – gorgeous
from start to finish.
BEN COLLIER
Documentary corner: Blackfish
Ben Collier
Writer
B
ack in November of last
year I wrote one of my first
‘Documentary Corner’
features on the film The
Cove – a powerful environmentalist
piece which showcased the grim
reality of dolphin and whale
hunting in Japan. As I mentioned
in that review, The Cove remains
one of a relatively small list of
documentaries which have made me
properly address and re-think some
of my own opinions and actions.
One section of the film which really
stood out to me was the discussion
of where dolphins and whales who
were caught in the wild were sent:
ocean parks, it seems, pay top dollar
for healthy Cetaceans to showcase,
with little concern over their
wellbeing. Therefore, it’s probably
fair to say that my opinion of places
like SeaWorld was already quite low
going into this week’s film, the 2010
Oscar-winner Blackfish; it doesn’t
get any better.
Here, the focus is entirely on
these parks, and the multitude of
ethical and safety issues they pose.
Through the film, we track the
life of one captive whale, Tilikum,
and the viewer really gets to see
the increasing mental toll that
captivity takes on his wellbeing,
as well as the danger he poses to
others. What one learns by the time
the end credits are rolling perhaps
should be obvious from the get-go:
Killer Whales are prone to killing.
This not-so-shocking revelation is
handled with a fitting seriousness,
and developed upon with a breadth
of stories of trainers being injured
or killed at the hands of their orca
trainees. Then, come the third act,
the focus switches to outlining the
lengths these water parks will go to
cover this all up.
The investigative journalism
performed by the film is perhaps
its strongest feature: for each attack
showcased, several close friends and
colleagues of the trainer affected
are interviewed – often the same
faces return for multiple cases –
giving a genuine emotional edge
to the reporting, that never feels
manipulative. Interestingly, most
of the people interviewed are ex-
trainers at places like SeaWorld.
Footage of them in their younger
years, bright and enthusiastic,
training with some of the eventual
victims, is effectively juxtaposed
with footage of them today – older
and more experienced. What they
– as well as the audience – now
understand is that the supposed
‘connection’ they had with their
whales was never real.
As a film with a message, Blackfish
is a masterclass. But unlike many
similar films, it actually managed to
spur on real-world change, playing
an essential role in getting SeaWorld
to announce the cancellation of its
orca breeding programme.
It’s rare to see a single film have
that much effect. We can only
hope this will see an end to whale
shows too. As I have mentioned
before, I don’t necessarily mind
a documentary with an agenda,
provided it doesn’t twist the truth
and (most importantly) isn’t
boring. Blackfish is not only a vitally
important film, but one that is
gripping and interesting from start
to finish.

Kung-Fu, Kickstarter, and how
crowdfunding is changing cinema
S
truck by lightning and bitten
by a cobra, Kung Fury is a
kung-fu freak of nature and
the chosen one. Working as
a cop on streets drenched in neon
and soaked in synth pop, he defends
1980’s Miami. Enter Adolf Hitler,
A.K.A. the Kung-Führer. On a
temporal murder spree to prove his
supremacy, Hitler must be stopped.
With the help of his friends
Hackerman, Triceracop (it’s exactly
what you think), and the Norse god
Thor (to name but a few) Kung Fury
must travel back in time to defeat
the Third Reich and take down the
worst criminal in history.
If any of that got you thinking
“this is ridiculous, I love it”, then
join the crowd. Specifically, the
almost eighteen thousand others
who, like you, thought this thing
should be made, and crowdfunded
David Sandberg on Kickstarter. On
the strength of a short trailer made
with his friends, online backers gave
the Swedish filmmaker $630,019
to make a 30 minute long movie ,
just because they thought it looked
awesome.Their faith was rewarded.
Kung Fury is an homage and
loving parody to the totally over
the top, enthrallingly ridiculous cop
shows of the 80’s. It’s cheesy, and
it knows it. At its core, it’s a piece
of meta-cinema that just wants to
have a blast, and pokes fun at the
various tropes and cinematographic
conventions of shows like Miami
Vice and Hawaii-Five-0 to hilarious
effect. Indeed, its indulgence of
tropes means it’s entirely predictable
in the final story outcome, but of
course that’s not what matters –
what matters is the journey, and
making that journey as crazy and
entertaining as possible.
Crowdfunding has already altered
the bounds of what’s possible
in many industries. For those
unfamiliar with the concept,the idea
is simple: someone with an idea puts
their proposal on a crowdfunding
site, and when people see an idea
they like, they pledge an amount
towards the project, sometimes in
exchange for rewards such as a copy
of the finished product. Many times
this simply boils down to people
wanting to support a worthy cause,
or just thinking something is too
cool to not have it exist.
This simple idea has been made
possible by the internet age, but
when it’s potentially so easy for
people to make their own videos
and get funding, you’ve got to
ask: what does this mean for the
medium? When will we see a totally
crowdfunded feature length film on
the silver screen? The answer is, we
already have, and more are on the
way. Around half a dozen movie
projects have received backing of
over $1 million. The biggest of
these, Super Troopers 2, is the sequel
to the 2001 cult classic crime-
comedy detailing the antics of five
prankster Vermont state troopers
battling budget cuts, Super Troopers.
Smashing its $2 million benchmark
to end up with almost $4.5 million,
it’s scheduled to open sometime in
2016.
More broadly, crowdfunding has
had a greater effect on the scale of
smaller independent filmmakers,
many of whom produce videos on
YouTubewithhighproductionvalue.
One such channel, CorridorDigital,
have produced multiple short films
and are currently working on a
production of their own movie.
Another,RocketJump,has produced
three seasons of the series Video
Game High School (VGHS) with
Kickstarter backing.
The upshot of this is that it’s a great
time to be a talented filmmaker. If
you’ve got ideas and guts you’re no
longer obligated to go through film
executives and large production
companies to realise your vision.The
consequence? Creators can reach
a wider audience and still retain
creative control over their projects,
leading to a diversification of the
stories being told in the cinematic
medium. Nowadays, it’s a lot more
likely that there’ll be something out
there to fit your exact tastes, though
you may have to do a little digging
to find it.
Crowdfunding has and will
continue to change what can
feasibly be achieved in cinema,
making the production of movies
a process more intensely involved
with its audience. For those with a
spare half hour I highly recommend
giving Kung Fury a watch and
seeing for yourself the first tremors
travelling through the world of film.
Whatever happens, its sure to be
interesting.
