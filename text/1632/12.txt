I
t is often said that familiarity
breeds contempt. While that
may not be true in life all the
time, in photography at least,
introducing a new observer to a tired
scene can definitely produce some
fresh perspectives. It is with this
notion that British photographer
Martin Parr curates Strange and
Familiar: Britain as Revealed by
International Photographers, a
photography exhibition of British
subjects by foreign photographers.
Known for his work scrutinising all
manner of British clichés, Parr now
turns his attention to what Britain
might look like to an outsider.
The exhibition held special
significance for me, as a foreigner
and an amateur photographer.
When I first stepped into the UK
in 2006, and then again in 2011, the
kind of pictures I took with my then
camera (a compact – how quaint!)
were of all the things I now find
absolutely quotidian, having lived
here for three years. Red telephone
boxes, pub signs, tubes pulling into
the station, squirrels in Hyde Park
– these are things that now go as
unnoticed as queueing up on the
right on escalators.
In a similar vein, the selected
pictures show us a side of Britain
from an outsider’s perspective,
drawing our attention to the little
quirks of British life that we so
often overlook and corners that we
neglect to acknowledge.
For example, American
photographer Bruce Davidson had
a keen interest in photographing
commonplace things that were
representative to foreigners, such
as formal dress codes and British
stoicism – things locals would
hardly bat an eyelid to. Yet, his
picture of women having tea in a
car (pouring it into teacups from
a thermos flask) and another of
couples basking on the beach in
formal dress encapsulate so much of
what is unique to British culture.

The
pictures
draw our
attention
to the little
quirks of
British life
Great Britain, strange yet familiar
Martin Parr brings together pictures of Britain as seen through outsiders’ lenses
Britain for varying lengths of time
spanning the 1930s to the present
day. Some, like Cas Oorthuys, were
here briefly with an express mission
to capture the character of British
cities, while others, like Edith
Tudor-Hart,eventually married and
settled in the country.
Shinro Ohtake on the other hand,
a 22-year-old scrapbook enthusiast
who had never previously been out
of Japan and spoke no English,
came to the UK to document the
experiences of a transient traveller.
What he produced was a body
of work almost like a stream-of-
consciousness observation of his
peregrinations through various
British towns and cities.
It is precisely the varied
experiences and purposes of the
photographers featured that made
the exhibition interesting. Laid out
across two floors, the photographs
are arranged in chronological order,
each individual photographer’s
body of work getting a section to
itself. While some common themes
ran through the exhibition, no two
photographers were the same.
Akihiko Okamura dedicated
himself to documenting conflict in
Northern Ireland, and on display
is an almost matter-of-fact look at
the sense of ordinary lives disrupted.
Gian Butturini and Frank Habicht
produced work that looked at the
sexual freedom and psychedelic
optimism that permeated London’s
youth culture in the 1960s – the
latter’s book “Young London:
Permissive Paradise” is on display in
a nearby case.
While the older photographs
give a more general take on Britain,
the more recent works seem to
focus on one or another aspect of
life in particular. One of the more
memorable projects is American
photographer Jim Dow’s Corner
Shops of Britain (1994), the result of
his fascination with local vernacular
architecture and their uncertain
future. He photographs the shop
fronts in taxonomical detail, and
they are printed on large, richly
coloured canvases. There is a sense
that it is only with his outsider’s
eye that the unique historical and
cultural value of the British family-
run corner shop is highlighted and
documented for posterity.
Strange and Familiar is a
delightful romp through the history
of Britain in the last century as seen
through foreign eyes. Although it
is made up of a patchwork of very
different perspectives, the vignettes
come together beautifully to tell the
story of what it means to be British.
Strange and Familiar is on at the
Barbican Art Gallery until 19 June.
