We’re having a mayor-off
Who should be in control of London’s £16 billion budget?
Grace Rahman
Editor-in-Chief
N
extThursday,Londoners
go to the polls to vote
in their new Mayor of
London. Twice-elected
Conservative Boris Johnson has
moved onto bigger and better
things, and now Labour’s Sadiq
Khan and the Conservative Zac
Goldsmith are going head to head
below in this: our comparison of the
two frontrunners.
Not discussed here are the Green
party’s Siân Berry or the Lib Dem
Caroline Pidgeon, because we’re
being realistic.
As usual, it’s very freaking difficult
to find any information in the run
up to elections about politicians’
actual policies with specific figures
to back them up. We’ve tried to do
our best. What we have covered
is both candidates’ fuck-ups,
upbringings and what they were
doing before they became MPs.
Does knowing the eastbound route
of the central line make you a better
mayoral candidate? That’s for you to
decide, friends.
Zac Goldsmith
Fuck-ups
So far in this campaign, Zac’s
been accused of
wading into
race relations
with all the
s u b t l e t y
of, well,
a white
g u y
from Eton
wading into
race relations.
It all started
whenhiscampaign
team sent leaflets
out to London’s
Tamil and Indian
residents based on their
surnames.The Tamil-targeted
leaflet warned recipients that
Khan hadn’t used “his position to
speak about Sri Lanka of the Tamil
community in Parliament”.The
text was slightly changed
for the leaflet targeting
Indians, which
talked about Jeremy
Corbyn wanting
to ban Indian PM
Modi from the UK. Voters that the
Goldsmith camp had identified as
Hindu were told that Zac would
champion family-owned businesses,
and protect them from Labour’s
“wealth tax on family jewellery”. As
well as buying into pretty tired racial
stereotypes, the surname-based
implementation of these leaflets
left Sikhs getting leaflets aimed at
Hindus. Many branded the attempt
at securing the ‘ethnic’ London vote
patronising and ill-informed.
On more light-hearted territory, a
super awkward video of Goldsmith
being interviewed by the BBC in
the back of the cab surfaced a few
weeks ago,and was a bit of headache
for the Conservative candidate.
He stumbled over questions
about what football teams play at
what stadiums, where the British
Museum was, and didn’t know
which stop came after Tottenham
Court Road on the central line
(Holborn by the way). In his
defense, he said he only ever takes
two routes on the underground, and
relies on Citymapper.
Upbringing
He went to Eton (duh),doesn’t have
a degree and his father was a knight. What did I freakin’ get?! Photo Credit: FELIX
Policies
One of Goldsmith’s biggest boasts
is that he’ll wrangle better deals for
London from his compatriots in the
Conservative government.
He’s also promising to double
house building in the capital, put
500 extra police officers on the tube
and create “more green spaces”.
History
Despite being chums with Boris,
Zac has a bit of a reputation for not
quite toeing the party line. Against
the whip, he’s voted for terminally
ill people being allowed to end their
lives, creating financial incentives
for low carbon emission electricity
generation, and various cases for
constitutional reform.
He was Editor of The Ecologist
magazine (a publication founded
by his uncle) before reviewing
environmental policy for the
Conservatives. In 2010 he followed
two of his grandfathers in becoming
an MP.
Before standing for Mayor,
Goldsmith sent out a ballot at his
own expense asking his constituents
whether they would be happy with
him running for this second role.
With a stunning majority, they
consented. Like Boris, he is pro-
Brexit.
Sadiq Khan
Fuck-ups
A pretty scary 20-year-old video of
Khan’s ex-brother-in-law shouting
about the evils of the west surfaced
online earlier this year. The man in
question, who hasn’t seen Khan in
years, is now a high-flying media
lawyer and dismisses the video as
dated but foolish.
Another accusation of
connections to extremists came
when it was discovered Khan
had “shared a platform” with an
organisation backed by extremist
imam who recruited for al-Qaeda,
whilst speaking out against the
UK’s extradition deal with the US
in 2005. Both Boris Johnson and
Zac Goldsmith were against this
extradition arrangement at the time,
but did not attend said event. Khan
has since distanced himself from the
groups, saying the events he spoke
at had nothing to do with the “vile”
organisation.
W h i l e
Goldsmith’s camp
continued to find
extremist ‘links’,
Khan’s sassy social
media team reacted
by not shying away
from his faith. An
example from his
Twitter page: “Hey @
ZacGoldsmith. There’s
no need to keep pointing
at me and shouting ‘he’s a
Muslim.’ I put it on my own
leaflets.”
Upbringing
His dad was a bus
driver (he talks
about this a
lot). His
p a r e n t s
w e r e
Pakistani
immigrants,
and he grew
up in his
constituency.
Policies
As many a wannabe London
Mayor has proposed, Khan is a fan
of the £1.50 hour bus ticket, so you
wouldn’t be penalised for taking a
couple of short trips on buses in a
row. He’s also promising a four year
freeze on tube and bus fares.
As far as housing, one of the most
contentious points in this election,
Khan is proposing a ‘London
Living Rent’based on the value of a
third of local income. Probably not
very promising if you’re living in the
nice side of Fulham, though.
History
Khan was a solicitor and chair of
human rights group Liberty, and
then became a Labour councillor
before his MP stardom. He used to
be the Labour whip and manned
Ed Miliband’s party leadership
campaign. He was one of the 35
MPs who nominated old Jezza
Corbyn for party leadership last
year, but didn’t vote for him in the
end.
According to theyworkforyou.com
he has consistently voted against
university tuition fees and as for the
answer to the question we ask of all
Labour candidates in a post-Blairite
world, he voted against the war in
Iraq.
Last time Labour were in power
he was transport secretary but now
he’s a plain old shadow minister and
MP for Tooting.
Since we discovered last year that
polls can’t really be relied on,the race
has become a lot more interesting.
Current forecasts do predict a win
for Khan and despite Labour’s poor
performance in last year’s general
election, the party saw a seven seat
gain in the capital, and now has
MPs in 45 of London’s 73 seats.
The deadline for voter registration
has now passed, but it’s pretty easy
to check if you are registered to vote
in Thursday’s elections if you haven’t
received a polling card in the post.
Go to aboutmyvote.co.uk, hammer
in your term-time postcode, and
they’ll give you your local electoral
registration office and all of its
contact details.Then all you need to
do is call or email to check you’re on
their list.

What’s your degree worth now?
Imperial is giving out more firsts and 2:1s than ever
W
e’re constantly
being told that
degrees aren’t as
valuable as they
used to be. And fair enough. Your
mate from home’s 2:2 in film and
media studies might not expect
to be as valuable as your mum’s
desmond in computing from the
80s, but an Imperial degree is an
Imperial degree, right?
Perhaps not. FELIX took a look
at the number of grades awarded on
individual courses and departments
between 2009 and 2014 and found
that there was a significant increase
in the proportion of 2:1s and firsts
awarded across most subjects.
The biggest leaps have been in
Aeronautics, Mathematics and
Mechanical Engineering, but
statistically significant increases
in the best grades have been seen
across most undergraduate courses.
So why is this happening?
Those who graduated in 2009
(having done a four year course)
were the last students to pay the
now eye-wateringly low £1175
annual fees. Students graduating
from 2010 to 2014 were almost
certainly paying £3000 a year.
£9000 fees were introduced from
September 2012, and these students
wouldn’t be graduating until 2015
at the earliest, the data from which
was not available.
We looked at this difference
between the proportion of 2:1s and
firsts earnt in 2009 and compared
this to the proportion of these
grades awarded in 2014, taking into
account the increase in students on
each course.
Out of the courses we tested, only
Bioengineering, Computing, Earth
Science and Engineering, and
Physics grades have not increased
with any statistical significance.
No course has decreased in
number of firsts and 2:1s awarded.
Every course has increased in size
since 2009.
The effective tripling of fees for
those who graduated after 2009
may mean that subsequent year
groups took their degrees a little
more seriously, and really felt the
pressure to reach a safe 2:1 or get
that holy grail first.
It may help to look at the
marking policy of the departments
where the degrees awards hasn’t
changed. Physics, for example,
introduced a scaling algorithm
back in 2009 to level the playing
field. Part of the reason for scaling,
in the department’s own words,
is to “prevent the distribution
of degree classes from changing
unacceptably”. The algorithm was
tested on past papers before being
implemented,and should not nudge
a student’s final degree classification
up or down. The system is more a
way to combat inconsistency in the
difficulty of exams between years,
rather than to bump up individual
marks.The algorithm is complicated,
kind of beautiful if you’re into that
and is published on the physics
department’s website. Physics has
only seen an increase from 82% to
84% over five years, which in this
case is statistically unexciting.
The computing department,
who also use a scaling algorithm
on exams, have not given out
particularly more firsts and 2:1s
since 2009 either.
The Mathematics department,
who have seen a steady climb from
62% to 82% over the five years, had
a change in weighting before 2009,
with the aim of better reflecting
students’success in the wider choice
of modules in their final years.
Before this, Maths were actually
giving out fewer 2:1s than other
departments.
It’s unlikely that any courses are
getting easier, and everyone we
spoke to agreed that students are
working harder, but some said there
is variation year on year as to what
key topics students have covered in
school.
Could students simply be
doing better nowadays? Taking
Mechanical Engineering as an
example, the ratio of applications to
admissions for those who graduated
in 2009 was the same as for those
graduating in 2014,at 5:1.However,
the average A Level tariff score on
entry jumped from 356 to 557 in
that time, probably partially down
to the introduction of the A* in
2010. Perhaps it’s simply harder to
get onto Imperial courses now.
It’s also important to remember
that there is distinct variation in
ability between year groups. Any
change to weighting or scaling takes
a few cohorts before change can be
seen and methods can be assessed.
Therefore, there’s a limit to how
much insight we can gain from a five
year sample. Regardless of the good
reasoning behind these changes,
employers in 2014 could pick more
Imperial Mech Eng grads with 2:1s
and firsts than in 2009, and so we
should still be interested.
How does this compare to the rest
of the country? Figures gathered
by the Higher Education Statistics
agency show that in 2014, there had
been a general trend of increasing
numbers of firsts and 2:1s being
awarded across disciplines. With
this, recruiters are looking towards
students who not only have the
grades but have experiences beyond
academia, for example writing for
their student newspaper. Just saying.
Chun-Yin San,the union’s Deputy
President (Education) told FELIX
it was: “important to emphasise
is that there’s nothing necessarily
wrong with more students getting
a first or 2:1 classification, and
given the reputation of Imperial
I don’t see there being a serious
risk of ‘devaluation’ as a result
of more people attaining good
results. Students are certainly not
working any less hard, and courses
aren’t getting less difficult – if
anything they are becoming more
challenging”.
We used a cheeky z score
calculation to check whether
these differences were statistically
significant, which is standard in
the social sciences for comparing
the proportions of two different
populations. If you really want to
have a look at the data we were
working from, email the editor,
although it’s all freely available to
anyone on Imperial’s website.
This is a continuing investigation.
Are you a professor, a dep rep, or
just an interested party? If you think
you know why grades have changed,
