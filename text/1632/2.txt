elcome back
all, to this, the
hottest, quickest
and oddest term
of the academic year. What an
action packed issue we have for
you this week. First of all, I dare
you to find a section without strong
references to Beyonce’s Lemonade
(puzzles doesn’t count). We’ve
got two features this week – one
on the mayoral election, the vote
for which happens next Thursday.
As per usual, I urge you all to get
out there and vote your socks off.
Think how invigorated you’ll be
for fluid thermodynamics 101
when you’ve had a healthy dose
of democracy that morning. Even
if you’ve got an exam that day,
flying home to recover from one,
or like me, are furiously cobbling
together a newspaper, you can
nominate someone to vote on your
behalf. FELIX is obviously non-
partisan, apart from that dalliance
we had with fully automated luxury
communism in first term, but you
know, maybe vote for the person
who’s actually either had a proper
job, not waded into racial politics

he knows nothing about, or I don’t
know, has a track record of not only
working for someone he’s related to
or in a job his forefathers have done
before him.Anyway,we should keep
race politics out of the editorial, it
never ends well.
Talking of people who don’t have
degrees (Zac Goldsmith), we’ve
delved headfirst into data this week,
and have taken a look out how
likely you are to come away from
Imperial with a first or 2:1 these
days. The answer is, well honestly,
you’re way more likely to now than
you were in 2009. We explore some
of the reasons why, but essentially,
most, if not all, departments are
trying their best to keep degrees
consistent whilst changing them
continuously to make sure students
aren’t penalised by variations in
exam difficulty between modules.
So if you are freaking out about
getting that coveted first, just
remember that higher marks are so
common now that employers are
tending to look for graduates with a
little more to offer. In a fascinating
coincidence, it’s not too late to get
involved with FELIX, and in fact,

T
his week at union
council, members were
treated to a presentation
from Citizens UK with a
view to becoming a member of the
campaigning charity.
A subscription would cost the
union £5000 per year, and would
include sending two sabbs on a
two day residential course (worth
£700 each), two day training in
London for an "unlimited number"
of volunteers and an unspecified
amount of in-house training.
The Citizens UK rep described
how the organisation helps its
members with the strategic
planning of their campaigns as well
as supporting causes of its own.
Amongst the campaigns it’s
spearheaded is the one demanding
London Living Wage, which
notoriously, ICU does not pay its
student bar staff. When this came
up at council, the rep said she would
“like all our organisations to become
living wage organisations”.
Although council was not quorate,
a straw poll vote was taken, and
there was a general consensus for
subscription to the service. The
decision, like all, will ultimately go
to Trustee Board, which consists
of the full time sabbatical officers,
union management staff and other
non-student members.
During discussions, one council
member asked whether or not this
would overlap with hirings the
union had made two years before.
The sabbs said that training wasn’t
currently being offered in the
capacity that they’d like. Others
questioned whether there was a
demand amongst Imperial students
to even instigate campaigns.
When asked, no one quite knew
which budget the subscription fee
would come from, if the deal went
ahead. It seemed likely that it would
come from the student development
fund, but full union budgeting for
next year is yet to take place.
