Live and let live, as long as you’re not tasty
FELIX explores the way in which meat-eaters eat, and some
misteaks they make in their thinking
M
orals are tricky things
to have. I try, like I’m
sure most of you do,
but there are grey
areas for me.Food can contain many
of them. Like all transcendental
ideas, it is sometimes easiest to
simply pick and choose them as you
like, but when they tie in to the very
substance we consume every day
(out of pleasure or necessity – but
that’s another thing entirely), I try
to adopt a more rigid line: I will eat
anything, as long as no unnecessary
suffering was caused to provide it.
I can already hear the carrots
being sharpened as the dozens
of vegans from around Imperial
launch to brand me an abuser of
my stewardship of the planet, a
bastard, or even worse a sadistic
animal slaughterer. But relax! This
isn’t aimed at you – it’s addressed to
all those who eat meat, be it fish or
flesh, and do not have the stomach
(heh) to participate in, or worse
acknowledge, the production of so
much of what we eat. So vegans,
vegetarians, relax – you’ve made
your choice, I’m just trying to get
the ‘guilt’) to an abattoir worker
who slices through thousands of
necks a day with no compunction
whatsoever. I had to make the
choice myself, when I pulled the
trigger or broke the neck. Why
should you feel better for passing
that on to someone else, and then
enjoying the end result nonetheless!
Besides, as barmy as it can sound,
you experience a great attachment
to any creature when you take its life
– something quite spiritual, as it’s a
great honour to be able to.
Still, I can understand people’s
reservations,as we didn’t all grow up
surrounded by life and death, other
than the family pets. I certainly
didn’t. Born to a family in the
suburbs, we stayed there. When
we did make trips to the coast
for holidays, fishing was seen as a
pleasant (or not) way to read a book,
with little intent to actually catch
anything, let alone have to kill it.
My father, raised as a (semi-)devout
Hindu, still struggles to kill fish to
this day – and I admire that he sticks
to his morals. Somehow, my parents
passed on none of that to me – I
will happily end the brief suffering
of a hooked fish or a downed bird,as
long as I can feel safe in saying that
the most will be made from it. For
example, I would never kill a non-
edible species without a very good
cause, as what’s in it for me?
If you’re not going to kill the beast,
you should at least appreciate what
it is. This is an issue that has been
focused on by so many – that people
are disconnected between pigs in a
pen, and pork in a packet. This, for
me, is the most woeful dishonesty
to yourself. If you’re going to
consume meat, you need to accept
where it came from – a real, living,
breathing animal that was killed and
butchered. The conditions animals
are raised and are slaughtered in can
vary massively, but I think that’s an
article for next week.
So please,the next time you wax on
about how cruel or savage hunters
are, just remember – if you want to
eat meat,an animal will have to die.*
Why not just do it yourself?
*obviously, this ignores lab-grown
meat. I suggest you ignore lab-grown
meat too.

If you want
to eat
meat, an
animal will
have to die
Rabbit (or chicken)
cacciatore
Whilst perfect for the rabbit that
is now gracing spring shelves, this is
equally as tasty with chicken – but
only use legs, as breast meat won’t
stand up to the slow braising.Rabbit
is available at many good butchers
in London for a lot cheaper than
chicken, so it’s a good way to try a
new, tasty meat without breaking
the bank – especially as it’s the right
time of the year to have it! And
don’t be afraid of the anchovies –
they add an unctuous background
to the sauce.Serve with crusty bread
to sop up the juices, a simple salad
and the rest of the bottle of wine.
1 rabbit, skinned, drawn and
jointed – get the butcher to do this
for you if you don’t want to follow
one of the many brilliant guides
available online.
(or use 3-4 chicken legs, skin on)
Coarse salt
50ml olive oil
200g smoked lardons
3 anchovies, washed to remove
salt and finely minced
1 peeled white onion, halved and
finely sliced
250g mushrooms, thickly sliced
1tbsp oregano
1tbsp minced thyme, dried or
fresh
1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves
picked and minced very fine
1tsp smoked paprika
2tbsp tomato paste
Glass red wine
1 tin peeled plum tomatoes, diced.
20 pitted black olives
2 tbsp capers
Ground black pepper
Fine salt, to taste
Extra virgin olive oil, to finish
Sprinkle the coarse salt heavily
over the rabbit/chicken, and set
aside to brine – this can be done a
while in advance.
wHeat the oil and start frying the
lardons in a large pan whilst you
slice the onion and mushrooms,
adding them to the pan along with
the anchovies when the lardons
are browned and most of their fat
has rendered out. Reduce the heat,
and stir regularly to dissolve the
anchovies in the fat.
After about 10 minutes, increase
the heat to high and get the onions
and mushrooms browning and
releasing all their liquid. In this
time, wash the salt from the rabbit/
chicken, and pat dry. Once most of
the liquid has evaporated away, add
a splash more oil and let it heat up,
before adding the rabbit/chicken,
herbs, spices and tomato puree. Get
some nice colour on the meat – try
and brown it on all sides - before
deglazing the pan with the wine.
Simmer for a few minutes and
then stir in the tomatoes (and all
their liquid), the capers and the
olives. Bring back to the boil then
simmer, covered, for about 20-25
minutes until very tender. For some
larger rabbits,it will take a bit longer
– but it’s a pretty forgiving cooking
method, so don’t worry too much if
you leave it in for a touch long.
Remove the meat to a warm plate,
and reduce the sauce till it coats the
back of a spoon. Season to taste,and
spoon the sauce over the beautifully
tender meat.
others to think about theirs.
Some people have called me
cruel, in the past, for harvesting
animals – rabbit, mackerel, pigeon
etc – where I could simply walk
into Tesco’s and buy some from the
shelf. Apparently, doing the deed
myself makes it somehow worse.
I’ve been called a butcher, or worse
a murderer. Poor old Flopsy – but
I got to do it myself, as opposed to
passing the responsibility (and thus
