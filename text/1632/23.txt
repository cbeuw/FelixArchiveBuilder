Batavierenrace: racing through the dark
Cross Country take on Batavierenrace and come fourth
S
ometimes a marathon isn’t
enough. On Saturday 23rd
April, 15 runners from the
Imperial College Cross
Country and Athletics Club
romped home to fourth place in
the Batavierenrace. With 348 teams
covering 172km through Holland
and Germany, the race demanded
high levels of speed, endurance,
strategy,and tolerance to Dutch rave
culture from the teams. Finishing
this strongly in the world’s biggest
relay race represents one of the
club’s finest collective achievements
in recent years.
The Batavierenrace kicked off at
12.45am, and was divided into four
stages: Night, Morning, Afternoon
and Finale. Athletes were paired up
and assigned to a set of two legs,
with one running and the other
taking on cycling duties, before
arriving at the end of the first leg
and swapping over. The pairs would
attempt to finish together at the
checkpoint, handing over to two
more athletes, who would vest and
saddle up before heading into the
Dutch countryside.
The surrealism of plunging head
first into the inky blackness was
not lost on the night team. Bicycle
headlamps and minibuses that
twinkled in the distance were the
sole sources of light for the majority
of the route, and techno music
blared from every available output
within the Dutch border. Leanne
Lyons was the star of the evening,
putting in a storming first leg to
secure the overall lead, running
3.6km in 14:08. From then on,
it was a fight to stay afloat. As we
crossed in and out of Germany, a
number of chaotic changeovers and
misdirection from a marshal meant
that the team found themselves
down in 28th
position by the end
of the night stage, a rapid fourth-
fastest Leg 8 from Anna Lawson the
remaining highlight of an otherwise
difficult night for the team.
The sun rose, the techno grew
louder, the trailing minibuses
regrouped and the morning team
was loaded. Our athletes responded
well to the sunlight, with Matt
Douthwaite, Anna Lawson, Chris
Thomas,MaddieWhybrow,Michael
Crone and Alwyn Elliott putting in
top-10 performances in their legs to
drag Imperial up to eighth position
in the standings. Dutch athletes,
weakened from a night of heavy
raving,brass music and an admirable
refusal to sleep, were left in our
wake as Michael won his 7.6km leg
in an eye watering 26:56 minutes.
Fatigue and merciless amounts of
Basshunter began to take their toll
on the teams, with minibuses seen
driving off in different directions
and Imperial losing time over a
botched changeover. The ability to
maintain composure and execute
our strategy and logistics grew in
importance, with Matt and Alwyn
holding on masterfully in cramped
conditions and without sleep to
ensure the team was always on track.
Without this aspect of our game,we
would have finished nowhere near
the front of the pack.
The afternoon team, by this
time rendered half-deaf by Avicii,
continued our ascent to the giddy
heights of fifth on the leaderboard.
Chris Thomas and Matt
Douthwaite ignored the changing
weather conditions to deliver first
and third places respectively, with
Susanna Tabor and Alwyn Elliot
handing over strongly to Alex
Warnakulasuriya and Leanne
Lyons, who powered into the
rapturous crowds of Enschede with
a pair of ninth places between them.
The team had done their job and
set the stage for a barnstorming
evening finale, with fourth place the
objective.
Enter Nuria Devos. Our
diminutive Spanish exchange
student was born for the weekend
of no sleep, high voltage thunder-
trance that crushed a number of
her British teammates. The gun
sounded and Nuria was released
from her cage, eyes lit, teeth bared,
an inextinguishable fire that tore
across the Dutch cobbles to 12th
place. Michael Crone followed
in typically electrifying fashion,
escaping the furious beats of
Enschede at breathtaking pace to
arrive at the University of Twente
in fourth place against fearsome
opposition. At the death, it was
Michael’s leg that earned Imperial
fourth place in the Batavierenrace.
With the exception of the few
who had participated in this race
two years ago, no athlete could
have anticipated the physical and
mental mill we were put through
this weekend. No runner could have
practised racing through what was
for one night the world’s biggest
nightclub. Yet it was the closeness
of this team, and their resolute
spirit, that carried the runners, bikes
and buses towards near-victory at
the Batavierenrace. Every member
played their part, every runner
ran as hard as they could through
unfamiliar and uncompromising
conditions, and everyone who
took part will hold this race up as
a highlight of their athletic careers
and time at Imperial College. The
Batavierenrace is to be feared,
respected,and ultimately conquered,
and no amount of electro-musical
torment from the Dutch could
prevent us from achieving our goal.
