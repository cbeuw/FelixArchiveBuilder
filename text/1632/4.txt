NUS elects controversial new president
Grace Rahman
Editor-in-Chief
A
t last week’s NUS
conference, delegates
from member
universities around the
UK elected Malia Bouattia as their
new president.
The 26 year old is the first ever
black woman to head up the
National Union of Students. She is
also a Muslim.
The tabloid news has been quick
to demonise Bouattia. Two years
ago, she delayed a NUS motion
condemning ISIS to change
the wording. In a piece for The
Guardian, she says the paper’s
motion appeared to “condemn all
Muslims, not just the terror group”.
After changes, the motion passed
with her support.
There have been accusations from
the mainstream media, students,
including Jewish Societies from
around the country, accusing her of
anti-semitism. A two year old video
of her making a reference to the
“Zionist-led media”, and an article
in which she calls Birmingham
university “something of a Zionist
outpost” have not helped her
campaign. Bouattia has since
maintained that her problems with
political Zionism should not be
confused with anti-semitism.
Members of Imperial College
Union’s own Jewish Society signed
a letter addressed to Bouattia before
her win, asking her to clarify why
she saw a large Jewish population
“as a problem”.
In attempt to prove the critics
wrong, as soon as she was elected
she held a meeting with the Union
of Jewish students, and has said she
will continue to work to show she is
not anti-semitic.
Many have pointed to the media
uproar concerning her election as an
example of Islamophobia.
Imperial is not currently a member
of the NUS, and has a tempestuous
history with the nationwide
students’ union.
Malia Bouattia is their first female black Muslim leader
ICU has left
the NUS a
whopping six
times
Despite being a founding member
when the organisation began in
1922, ICU has left a whopping six
times.
The college was a member for
a number of years, despite several
referendums at to whether we
should stay. In 2010, we voted to
leave and stop paying the £40,000 a
year subscription fee.
Despite receiving some bad
press in recent years, the NUS
was responsible for much of the
lobbying that led to council tax
exemption for students and the
lowering the voting age to 18 as
well as spearheading a Barclays
boycott to protest its involvement in
apartheid South Africa.

M
any of us suspect that
Imperial’s concerned
more with its image
than ever before, and
now it has hired a ‘Vice President
for Communications and public
affairs’. From September the new
post will join the highest managers
at Imperial, including the VPs for
Advancement and Innovation.
There is no doubt that successful
PR is needed to secure valuable
funding for research, improving the
university buildings and equipment,
as well as providing for student
bursary funds.
Alice Gast, Imperial’s President,
said it was necessary to “forge
connections across disciplines,
institutions and borders” and to
do this we need “excellent and
thoughtful communications”. Upon
his appointment, Blair said that
Imperial had a “simply amazing
brand”.
Imperial’s name and branding
changed in 2010 from a more
traditional crest to the current blue
‘Imperial College London’ logo.
Before crossing over to PR, Blair
was a political correspondent at the
Evening Standard. Now, at the top
of his field, he is part of the London
Communications Agency and has
commanded over communications
for parts of the NHS, TfL and the

His LinkedIn profile also reports
that he has a Grade 6 in trumpet.
Ex-student Trevor Philips says Muslims in
Britain “do not want to participate”
He was ICU President, was awarded honorary fellowship by college, and now he’s
made a controversial program claiming to show “what Muslims really think”
E
x-ICU President and
broadcaster, Trevor
Philips, appeared in a
Channel 4 documentary
called “What do Muslims really
think?” The controversial show,
which aired in the Easter break,
reflected on a poll which had
quizzed Muslims on their thoughts
on issues like homosexuality, sharia
law and human rights.
The data collection methods
have been criticised by a number
of sides. Muslims were interviewed
in areas where a minimum of 20%
of the population practice Islam,
which are also home to some
of the poorest and religiously
conservative Muslim families. This
arguably isn’t a representative view
of Muslims living throughout the
UK. The control group given the
same questions were also only
interviewed on the phone, rather
than face to face.One of the most
misleading answers was that about
reporting terrorism. Although 34%
of Muslims said they would report
someone to the police who they
knew was involved with people who
supported terrorism in Syria, this
figure was only 30% in the control
group. Despite this, Philips called
the stat “alarming”.
Others have commented that any
very religious groups, including
Orthodox Jews or Catholics, would
likely have similar opinions on
homosexuality and separatism.
Trevor Philips did a Chemistry
degree at Imperial before becoming
ICU President in 1974. He
later headed up the NUS before
becoming a TV researcher. After
stints in the volunteer sector and a
position on the London Assembly
for Labour, Philips became the
chair of the Equality and Human
Rights Commission.
In 2007, he was awarded
Imperial’s “highest honour” by
being admitted to the Fellowship
of Imperial College London during
the Postgraduate Graduation at the
Royal Albert Hall. This was whilst
he was chair of the Commission for
Equality and Human Rights.
In an interview with the college
for its alumni webpage, he said
that after graduating he was told
by a graduate employer: “Get real.
Radical leftie. Black. And let’s be
honest,not really much of a chemist.
We can see trouble coming, and
you’ve got it written all over you.Try
something else”.
Philips has long spoke out against
multiculturalism, so much so that
the London mayor at the time, Ken
Livingstone, accused him of being
so right-wing that he “would soon
join the BNP”.
He has also previously spoken
at Imperial as part of its Diversity
Lecture series, which aims to
promote “knowledge,awareness and
understanding” of diversity.

NUS votes to allow student media to comment on
union elections
A
t last week’s NUS
conference, a motion
was passed which
should allow student
media organisations to cover union
elections in more detail.
Most unions insist student
newspapers only publish election
material okayed by the candidates.
Students who wrote the motion
argued that ‘propaganda’ like
manifestos and stilted interviews
did not provide enough analysis of
policies to properly inform students.
Student journalists from Bath,
who presented the paper to change
NUS policy, are prevented by their
union from commenting on current
officer performances during the
election period.
Imperial College Union’s policy
on FELIX states that elections must
be “given extensive coverage” and in
the run-up to voting we print the
sabbatical candidates’ manifestos.
Despite not being in the the union
by-laws, the official FELIX policy
or the election rules, any mention
of one candidate during the election
period must be accompanied by
the names of every other candidate
in the running for that position. If
FELIX doesn’t do this or breaks
this rule in any way, the candidate
themselves (rather than FELIX)
will be punished. This could mean
a temporary campaign ban, a
reduction in campaign budget or a
withdrawal of the candidate from
the elections.
Any kind of perceived
endorsements within FELIX are
banned, however, other sabbatical
officersarefreetoendorsecandidates
on their own social media pages, as
was seen during this year’s elections.
We weren’t allowed to print this
picture we drew as part of last term’s
election coverage as the union said
it endorsed one of the candidates.
