Of hipsters, exams, and millenials
Millenials lack the sense of collective purpose that defined previous generations

f you’re somehow reading this,
you’re probably taking that
small break in the library café
before coming back upstairs
for your revision. Here we are! It’s
the final term! You’re probably, like
me, starting to feel the library is not
your second, but your first home.
It is where all your life, aspirations,
and social interactions will exist
until you’re done, and you’re totally
cool with becoming a completely
dysfunctional piece of pseudo-
zombie,trying to overstimulate your
caffeine-addict brain for the next
four weeks.
As you’re sucked into the exam
period lifestyle, you might believe
this is fairly normal behaviour. But
it is not. Not even for classic top
university standards. This student
generation is probably the most
serious, diligent and hardworking in
the history of modern mainstream
university.Ifyou’reunsureaboutthis,
ask your parents. The three to four
years of state-sponsored hedonism
has become a £9,000 a year product
you buy in order to survive in the
overcrowded graduate job market.
Never-ending bar nights are
outnumbered by library all-nighters.
Student activism and fights with
the police are replaced by petitions
to our unions to keep libraries open
all night.And the idealist,politically
engaged student is replaced by the
networking-obsessed, internship
seeking student.
All of this is part of a greater
cultural shift.
Think about what defined people’s
aspirations before our times. There
was always some glue that made
everyone, especially young people,
connect, and gave them a sense of
collective purpose. I can throw in
some examples. Centuries ago we
can talk about religion,or defending
your country, as something that
moulded this collective sense of
purpose.
At the start of the last century, we
can think of socialists, anarchists
and fascists around Europe.
However you might feel about
them, you can see that they had
their own mutual purpose, and an
ethos to look forward to (a world
without government, a world
without bourgeois oppression, a life
solved by your charismatic, overlord
dictator).
In the 40s in Britain, the defining
issue of their time was to win the
war against totalitarianism. In the
60s, the hippies dreamt of a more
peaceful, less restrictive and more
loving society.
All of these examples have
something in common. There
was always a sense of direction.
Whether it was fighting for your
country, fighting for the workers,
fighting for peace and love, young
people had some ideal to look up to.
A world to look forward to.
There is nothing like that today.
No higher ideal to look up to. The
defining issue of our time is a lack
of sense of direction. This sense of
collective purpose is gone, absent,
dead. It’s been fully replaced by
the individual. Society, as a whole,
doesn’t know where it is going since
the Berlin wall fell and the whole
notion of “good ones” and “bad
ones” disappeared.
The end of collective ambition
culturally leads to the postmodern
(or post-postmodern) world we live
in today. Art and creative expression
is shown as a skeptical and playful
response to any established
concept. It is defined by confident
uncertainty about the world, a self-
conscious, self-referential, skeptical
judgement of today’s culture. And
the perfect embodiment of this
death of purpose is the figure of the
hipster.
Yes, hipsters. The 60s gets hippies,
the 70s gets punks. And we get
hipsters. By all means, I don’t mean
to complain about their existence,
as so many people do. I’m not some
kind of subculture racist. I just tend
to think of the hipster “movement”
as the perfect personification of
our postmodern struggle to find
purpose. The hippies wanted a
peaceful world, punks wanted to
liquidate the government. What do
hipsters want?
Nothing. Or maybe something.
Who knows? They don’t know.They
are inherently contradictory. They,
like postmodern artists, revolve
around avoiding mainstream
dogma, which ends up becoming a
dogma in itself. They enjoy things
ironically instead of effusively.
Any attempt to define how they
usually dress will, as any attempt
to define, look for common traits
between hipsters, which will then
become too mainstream for them,
and will immediately make them
depart from those traits. And this
lack of purpose is also a lack of
collective purpose, because the
hipster is much more about the
individual than about the collective.
It is an empty, ironic, self-conscious
“movement”.
The loss of collective purpose,
of that glue that would hold a
generation together, is lost within
our generation (or millennials, as
big companies like to call us). We
are strangely individualistic. Maybe
the only dream we can think of for
millennials is building your own
startup and getting rich quickly.And
for the rest of us, securing that pre-
internship, internship and graduate
job we need to keep ourselves up to
social expectations.
I am not saying this situation is
inherently bad. God, I sure prefer
an individualistic, aimless and
lost generation than a collective,
purposeful Hitler Youth movement.
But there is something about the
loss of any collective aspiration that
is inherently sad in our apathetic,
online-petition-activist students.
We have become obsessed about the
individual.
There is some good news, though.
According to Deloitte’s Millennial
survey 2016, millennials want a
job that gives them purpose, not
just a big salary. Companies are
attempting to adapt to this whole
new workforce that values crazy
things like “work-life balance” and
“job satisfaction” more than money.
Maybe this is a good consequence
of this lack of collective purpose
among our generation. We attempt
to find purpose individually, within
our jobs. And hell, who am I to
judge.
In the end, we are all here, at the
edge of modern culture, trying to
find meaning, to make our own
meaning, or just to accept there is
none and desperately attempt to
feel something as we fuck our way
towards the end of days.
Here we
are! It’s the
final term!

You have bad taste if you like ales
I’m thankful that I’m not from a country whose culture relies on such awful drinks

E
very day I wake up I thank
the gods I’m not English.
I thank them because I
was not born in a country
where a family of layabouts is put
on the throne and worshipped for
no goddamned reason. I thank
them because I have much more
international football to remember
fondly. I thank the gods because my
Prime Minister isn’t someone who
put a private part of their anatomy
inside a dead pig (although I curse
them because a former Prime
Minister of mine put a private part
of their anatomy inside an underage
girl).
Every day
I wake up
I thank the
gods I’m
not English
I thank the gods because I wasn’t
born somewhere where the phrase,
“it’s a lovely sunny day today,” is
said far less often than, “this pasta
is awfully overcooked,” but most
importantly of all, I thank the
gods for not making me from that
nation that inflicted ales upon the
world. Maybe my wallet and my
liver thank them less, because if I’d
thought that all beer tastes like ale, I
would’ve enjoyed a lot less drinking,
or pubs, or life in general.
Ales are awful. They’re less
pleasant than strained sock juice
and far more expensive to acquire.
They are the gustatory equivalent
of a butchered pig’s dying wail.
They taste like the tears of a bitter,
impotent man, and if you ask me
how I know what that tastes like
I can tell you I know because I’ve
tasted ales, and there’s no doubt in
my mind it’s the same flavour.
And they ruin nights out!
Specifically, mine. Every once in
a while, a friend will offer to get a
round and bring me a pint of ale,
even though pouring that swill on
my trousers and pretending I’ve
pissed myself is a source of more
enjoyment for me and everyone
around me.
I’m not even safe if I order other
beers, as there’s been this perfidious
trend of “craft lagers”, which are just
ales trying to escape the curse of
their name. And on those occasions
that I’m tricked into drinking an ale,
my taste buds will be tainted for the
rest of the evening, distorting every
flavour afterwards and ruining beers
that had no crime other than being
drunk after spider-infested mildew.
In most bars, there will be several
– too many – ales on tap, despite
the fact that the selection is like
choosing between different puddles
of rainwater on a muddy road
leading to a horse crematorium. To
someone who hasn’t acquired the
taste for slightly acrid windshield
condensation, the only options
available are the usual suspects of
Heineken, Stella and Fosters, but
even their bland,uninspiring flavour
is a godsend if I get to avoid having
an ale.
They taste
like the tears
of a bitter,
impotent
man
At this point you may say, it’s just
a matter of taste. And yes, that is
completely true:I don’t like ales.And
it’s not for lack of trying. On more
than one occasion I’ve thought to
myself,“Millions of people like ales:
they can’t all be wrong. Now you’re
gonna get yourself an ale, and you’re
gonna enjoy it.” Then I got myself
an ale, and I didn’t enjoy it. I could
leave it be, but for every round that
has been ruined for me by a damp
loincloth rinsing, for every night
I’ve been forced to stay on Carlsberg
for four pints, I ask of you, I beg of
you, English people, cease this love
affair with tepid backwash spat out
by a coffee addict.
I’m real happy for you, people
who love ales and can somehow
find joy in them. I just hope that
you never have something that
actually tastes better, like Erdinger,
or Hoegarden, or Blue Moon, or,
gods forbid, Chimay, or literally
any lager ever made; I fear that the
superior flavour might just destroy
your poor inexperienced tongue and
make your head explode for all the
years you could’ve been having good
alcohol instead of watered down
mosquito distillate.
For the rest of us who aren’t
living in a perpetual Stockholm
syndrome from pulped corrugated
carton fluid, please stop being so
much in love with ales. It’s making
me legitimately concerned for you,
and, more importantly, limiting my
choices at the pub. Please.
You can have an ale every once in a
while if you want to remind yourself
that we live in an uncaring world of
strife and misery, but, on most days,
stick to drinkable liquids. Life’s too
short to spend it on ales.

been this
