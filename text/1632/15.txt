GAMES
A different sort of storefront

Itch.io is paving the way for the post-capitalist indie gaming future

tch.io is a platform that
allows indie game developers
to distribute their games for
free. The majority of games
available on the platform are either
free, incredibly cheap or pay-what-
you-want. Itch corp has even
experimented with reverse sales -
allowing developers to increase the
price of their games for a limited
time. Perhaps the most surprising
part of itch.io’s model is that pay-
what-you-want also extends to their
revenue sharing model. Developers
can choose to give itch corp
anything from zero to 100 percent
of each transaction.
Unsurprisingly, this model has
attracted different kinds of games
and interactive experiences. The
modern vocal gamer of the internet
Most developers put their games
on itch.io with the understanding
that the majority of gamers will
pay nothing, a sizable amount will
pay the suggested dollar, and an
even smaller amount will pay after
‘completing’ the experience.
Indie musicians have a similar
platform in Bandcamp, and it’s easy
to expect that in the near future
other online industries will spawn
similar ‘storefronts’. With mobile
apps moving towards freemium and
ad-based models, digital stores like
Steam rapidly devaluing the price of
games with frequent sales, and tools
like Unity flooding the market with
new games, the relatively young
indie game industry is a radically

mily is away is an
interactive, branching
visual novel set in MSN-
inspired chat client. Its’
visuals and sound effects, from the
classic Windows XP start sound
to the low rumbling of a desktop
computer, will be instantly familiar
to those who grew up using
Microsoft’s iconic communication
software.
Set over a number of years, you
chat with your friend Emily from
before the start of college all the
way to your senior year (and its
heardbreaking ending).
Early on, Emily asks you where
you want to go to college (which
affects future narrative choices): an
engineering, arts or business school?
But rather than reflecting my own
past I chose to attend art school.
If given the option to go back and
make that decision in my real life
again, would I have done the same?
I’m not sure, but for a brief moment
emily is away pushed me to reflect
on my past decisions via the most
simple of game mechanics.
Even though you’ve only been
chatting for emily for a few minutes,
it’s not long before you feeling like
you’re talking with a real person.
Emily is away reminds us of more
innocent times capturing an era
of and period in our teenage years
and early adulthood that is hard to
forget.
It’s a game for the generation
who lost themselves in awkward
MSN flirting; before the rise of the
aubergine emoji, Netflix and chill,
and sliding into DMs.

Imperial’s gaming magazine

short, political, and provocative
games. These sort of experiences
are often at risk of being exclusively

YouTube) rather than interacted

problem that many indie developers
have found hard to solve.
One solution is to decrease
the value of games and alter the
model of purchase altogether.
