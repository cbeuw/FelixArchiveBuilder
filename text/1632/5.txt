Let me and Beyoncé feel our feelings
Tessa Davey
Comment Editor
A
couple of months ago, I
wrote an open letter in
FELIX. It was directed
at my very recent ex-
boyfriend, and in it I attempted to
verbalise the pain I felt and some
of the things I realised in the wake
of our breakup. It wasn’t something
that I wrote originally with the
intention of publishing it in FELIX,
but for me, the act of editing it for
publication and seeing it printed
was incredibly cathartic.
After FELIX hit the campus
on the Friday morning, I started
to receive messages. Messages of
concern, messages of admiration,
but overwhelmingly, messages
telling me that I shouldn’t have
published it, or at the very least,
telling me that I shouldn’t have
put my name to it. It wasn’t, I was
repeatedly told, appropriate to air
my feelings so publicly. Personal
matters, it was emphasised, should
be kept private.
This sentiment is not one shared
by Beyoncé. In Lemonade, Beyoncé
shows us the very raw emotion

of marriage post-infidelity. Many
people are calling it a publicity
stunt, or saying that it isn’t real.
While that may be true, why is it so
hard to believe that a woman would
stand up and say that her heart has
been broken?
As women, we are socialised to
mask any pain that we experience.
Women are taught that if they show
feelings, you look crazy. We are
expected to stay silent and apologise
for every emotion that escapes us,
because surely we must be the ones
who are at fault. We are told that
to be successful we must only show
There is as much dignity in being honest as in staying silent
She is my
queen
the aspirational aspects of our lives.
Even positive sentiments, such as
the ones expressed in my letter, can
be lost in the discomfort caused by
being upfront.
Beyoncé shows us that it is
not undignified to feel. Whether
Lemonade is about her life, her
mother’s, or any one of the billions
of heartbroken women throughout
history, Beyoncé is acknowledging
the pain and anger that is felt by
women but so often dismissed.
As well as the beautifully lit,
filtered images we post on Facebook
to advertise our lives, there are real,
messy emotions, which we should
not have to apologise for. Beyoncé is
owning her emotions, and handling
them with absolute dignity. She is
an inspiration to all women who
are made to feel ashamed of their
feelings, and for that, she is my
queen.

The NUS doesn’t represent Jewish students
O
n Wednesday 20th
April,
the NUS voted in Malia
Bouattia as the first
female black Muslim
president. It is great that at a time
when Islamophobia is increasing
and London mayoral candidate
Sadiq Khan is pettily attacked
over past acquaintances, the largest
student body stands together
with it’s minorities by celebrating
diversity, voting in someone with
immense life experience in wartime
troubles.
However, the Jewish community
is fearful. In fact, our own Jewish
Society co-presidents were two of
the signatories of an open letter
bringing past comments made by
Bouattia into question. The letter’s
accusations did not convince me
that Bouattia is anti-Semitic, but
they were a worry that needed
addressing. It is beyond dodgy to
call the University of Birmingham a
“Zionist outpost” because there are
a large number of Jews.
The comments were made several
yearsago,soifBouattiaacceptedthat
she expressed herself badly, I would
let it go.However,it is disconcerting
that her first reply on twitter was
unconvincing and defensive. If the
NUS president truly understood the
Jewish community, she would have
used a reassuring tone. However,
rather than accept that many of the
students that she will represent are
pro-Israel, she defended her right to
disagree with them.
It irritates me that she falsely
claimed that her faith is being used
as “an opportunity” to accuse her of
anti-Semitism. The allegations are
legitimate,no matter whether or not
she is Muslim.
What is perhaps more shocking
is that Bouattia believes that think-
tank The Henry Jackson Society
should not have influence over
policy making in the UK because
it is “pro-Zionist”. It does not
even identify as Zionist. I can only
assume that she thinks that the only
think-tanks that should be allowed
to promote policy are the ones in
line with her opinions.
To the successful candidate’s
credit, she has since written a more
reconciliatory piece for the Guardian
saying she would take back these
words if necessary.
I believe the controversy boils
down to the fact that many young
Malia Bouattia needs to accept
that some will disagree with her
Virulently
anti-
Zionist?
Really?
Jews do not feel represented by the
NUS. The issue goes further than
this,because plenty of other students
do not fit into NUS ideology either.
This is a reason why Imperial
disaffiliated in 2008.There are many
right-leaning students out there,
and their opinions are not reflected
in the radically left-wing union that
stands up for them. You could argue
that Conservative government is
bad for British further education,
so a student organisation might be
justified in speaking out against it,
but virulently anti-Zionist? Really?
To end on a positive, I am uplifted
by those youth leaders,such as Rabbi
Leah Jordan, student chaplain at
Liberal Judaism, who are aware of
the precarious situation and who
are ready to work with the new
president to ensure she understands
what Jewish people expect of her.
Malia Bouattia said she has already
held a meeting with the Union of
Jewish Students, so progress is
certainly possible.
Check your privilege
It’s time to recognise that it’s not an expression
of your freedom of speech to make jokes about
marginalised parties

T
his piece is something of
a sequel – the aftermath
of a Women@Imperial
week interview in
FELIX about a month ago. I spoke
about my experience at Imperial as
a woman of colour, my reaction to
sexist comments that were made
as “jokes”, as well as the issue of
gendered insults, particularly when
it comes to female lecturers. I
did this so I could tell those that
participated that it was not okay. It
didn’t work.
Encouragingly, the department
reacted well; there were discussions
about the topic in the student-staff
committeemeeting,andourclassrep
sent an email asking anybody who
felt as if they’d been marginalised
to report it. The issue was more to
do with ignorant behaviour and
comments being normalised and
accepted, but the recognition of it’s
existence was a start. In any case,
the email didn’t go down very well
with many people – they reacted by
making jokes about marginalisation,
which have continued even since
I’ve made it clear I did not like them.
I’m still not sure whether
these comments were sarcastic
or ignorant, or maybe a bit of
both. Generally, I think it comes
from a misunderstanding of what
marginalisation is, the effects it
has, or the fact that it is subtle
and pervasive. To understand
marginalisation, we need to
understand privilege.
What does it mean to be a
minority? From a young age we
consume images of “successful
people” from every field, and
the default person represents an
unrepresentative sample. In Britain,
these are usually white males from
the Home Counties, because even
accent plays a role in perception.
Somebody speaking the Queen’s
English comes across as intelligent
and well-reasoned, while Essex
accents are seen as “chavvy”. Having
a European accent of any kind is
interesting and sounds “cultured”,
but Asian or African accents are
mocked. This is just one small
example of how privilege affects the
way you are perceived.
How does privilege manifest
itself? Getting to Imperial can
be considered to be the result of
privilege. The way your family
encouraged you, even passively, by
being a certain class. The school
that you went to, and the support
you had is all a privilege, and not
something that everybody gets to
experience, which limits access to
things. This happens to different
extents for different people, and it
is important to remember that we
are not on a level playing field. Not
everybody is lucky enough to have
a smooth path to university, or to
get a second chance if there was
adversity along the way. (Shout out
to Materials Dept, I appreciate it).
It’s difficult to accept the fact that
our successes may not be entirely
down to personal responsibility, and
are more a product of circumstance.
They are only slightly due to hard
work, and are mainly a result of
living in a privileged world. I’m
not saying that you should give
up all your privileges, or that a
privileged person is not worthy of
their successes. What I am saying is
that you should acknowledge your
privilege, and understand you are
not better than somebody who is
disadvantaged.
Perhaps if this was considered,
people would understand why
jokes about suicide, disability,
AIDS, socioeconomic background,
or race are not okay if made by an
uninformed privileged observer.
Why having a “slave auction”
for fun is twisted, or why “jokes”
about women making sandwiches
are sickening. If your “jokes” are
trivialising or laughing at a struggle
that is not your own, they are not
funny. Jokes like this foster a culture
where disadvantage, prejudice and
inequality are made light of,and can
continue.
Refusing to recognise the effect of
privilege and how it disadvantages
people, and exacerbating it with
ignorant comments, leads to entire
groups of people being made to
believe their contributions are not
important or necessary. That is
marginalisation.
Ideally, just saying this would be
enough to open the eyes of those
that don’t believe they were ever
wrong, misinformed or ignorant
about anything. People would
understand why it is important
to be empathetic towards others,
and would stop talking over other
people. Regardless of any social
awareness, wouldn’t this just be
good sense?
I wish that people would enjoy
supporting and helping others when
they can, rather than tearing them
down for fun. Unfortunately, I don’t
believe that’s the case, and a few
people will actually be encouraged
when they see people react adversely
to offensive comments; they thrive
off being “outrageous”. When
they are actually criticised for
this behaviour, they will play the
victim and say that they are being
constrained.
Saying that these “jokes” are
unacceptable is not a restriction
of your freedom of speech, it’s an
expression of mine.

successes
may not
be down
to personal
responsibility
