Weekly Game ofThrones – S6 Episode 1
A
fter slapping viewers in
the face last season with
another huge character
death, Game of Thrones
returned this week with a relatively
uneventful episode,filled with set up
for the rest of the season. Spoilers
ahead (obviously).
This being the first season to
completely overtake the books in
nearly every plotline did fuel some
speculation that this season would
continue a downward trend after
the relatively mediocre season five
but this episode, at least, was pretty
okay, if a bit slow. If nothing else
there wasn’t any ‘bad poossy’ level
writing at least.
Not shying away from the events
of last season, the episode opened
where we last left off, with a shot
of Kit Harrington’s Jon Snow
lying dead in the grounds of Castle
Black before being scooted away by
Davos. No resolution or progression
on that plot thread just yet then.
Moving a little further south to
Ramsay freaking out after his wife
and buddy ran off together, we
see him showing a rare display of
emotion at the death of Myranda
before sending her body off to feed
his dogs. Classic Ramsay.
Theon and Sansa finding Brienne
and Podrick was a pretty good
scene. As always, it’s a pleasure to
see Alfie Allen in this role as well
as Pod finally learning to fight. It’s
good to see Brienne finally getting
to fulfil her oath after a season and a
half of hiking around the continent
and occasionally getting the shit
kicked out of her.
Varys strolling around Meereen,
buying babies, listening to Red
Priests. Nothing much going on
here other than a dick joke and a
port fire.
Daenerys’ scene, surprisingly, was
the main source of comic relief in
the episode with a conversation
between two of the Dothraki that
could have come out of a Seth
Rogen movie and then a Monty
Python-esque squabble with Khal
Moro and his bloodriders: “Ok,
seeing a beautiful woman naked for
the first time is among the five best
things in life!”
Arya’s training continues, albeit
while blinded and homeless. Girl
can’t catch a break. On the plus side,
eventually she’ll get Daredevil like
skills.
Melisandre’s scene at the end
proved to be the most intriguing of
the episode (and not because of the
obligatory HBO toplessness) with
her transformation into a withered
old woman. Where this leads
remains to be seen. I just hope we
Jamie and Cersei’s reunion was
a surprisingly tender affair, clearly
Cersei’s shame walk has changed
her a great deal.Jamie’s character,on
the other hand, has regressed back
to his season one arrogance. I mean
“Fuck anyone who isn’t us” doesn’t
seem like something to come out of
the mouth of the changed man that
came out of season three.
We then returned to everyone’s
favourite storyline – Dorne! I think
this scene was intended to be a bit
of a classic Game of Thrones wham
moment but, honestly, none of the
characters are interesting enough
for us to care too much when they’re
killed, especially when it’s not clear
what the effect is going to be, other
than more awful Sand Snake scenes.
We then drop into Tyrion and
Spoilers
ahead
(obviously).

Writer
don’t have to see her get out of bed
like that next week.
Ultimately, aside from the events
in Dorne and the revelation about
Melisandre, the episode didn’t
have too much interesting going
on, and more just served to remind
the viewers of whereabouts in this
massive world all the characters are,
and giving some ideas about what’s
to come.
Game of Thrones is available on
HBO GO
