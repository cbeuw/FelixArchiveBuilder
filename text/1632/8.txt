When Beyoncé Gives You Lemons
Indira Mallik

L
emonade, Beyoncé’s sixth
studio album dropped on
Saturday, with nothing
but a seconds-long cryptic
YouTube video to promote it. The
‘visual album’, directed by seven
directors including Kahlil Joseph
(Kendrick Lamar’s ‘m.A.A.d’), and
Melina Matsoukas (‘Pretty Hurts’,
‘Formation’) is something special.
Beyoncé has previously spoken
about her habit of rooting her songs
in imagery throughout the creative
process, and in Lemonade she has
created music to be watched.
It is not just visuals; spoken
word also informs the experience
of listening to Lemonade. In
‘Formation’, released earlier this
year, Messy Mya, and Big Freedia
voice clips provided punctuation to
the melody, in Lemonade, Beyoncé
evolves the concept by reading
poetry written for the album by the
Somali-British poet Warsan Shire
(London’s Young Poet Laureate)
interspersed with the songs.
The album is stunningly
ambitious. Just as the camera
seamlessly shifts from bayous, to
drowned mansions, to downtown
New Orleans, to underground car-
parks, vast plantations, weaving
through the urban and rural Deep
South, so does the music. Twelve
songs, split into chapters which
stage the unravelling of a marriage,
effortlessly skip through genres:
from rap, to soulful ballad, by way
of country, and dance. In lesser
hands, it might have come across
‘Don’t Hurt Yourself’ which is raw,
rap heavy, and rage fuelled; ‘6 Inch’,
a collaboration with The Weeknd,
is gritty and layered; James Blake
accompanies Beyoncé in a short
lyrical ballad; and in ‘Freedom’,
one of the last songs of the album,
Kendrick Lamar stars in a song that
could easily be a bonus track on To
Pimp a Butterfly.
On the surface,Lemonade is a very
specific, seemingly autobiographical
narrative of a marriage under strain
of secrets and betrayal. Her lyrics,
which specifically reference Jay Z,
(“Big homie better grow up”) and
Beyoncé’s use of home videos in the
film, seems to lend credence to the
rumours of Jay Z’s affair that have
circled ever since 2014, when her
sister, Solange, attacked Jay Z in an
elevator at the Met Gala.
Look a bit deeper, however,
and Lemonade is about a lot more
than infidelity. If ‘Formation’ is a
celebratory anthem of self-love for
her identity as a black woman, the
reward of self-acceptance and pride,
Lemonade charts the journey it took
to get there.
At times, early in her career, with
the release of albums I am… Sasha
Fierce, 4, and even the 2013 hit
Beyoncé, Beyoncé was accused of
dismissing her blackness, neatly
sidestepping any attempt at political
stance in favour of drawing in a
wider, whiter, fan-base. “I tried to
change / closed my mouth more
/ tried to be softer / prettier / less
awake”, she confesses. As the album
progresses,she’s done trying.“I don’t
give a fuck, chucking my deuces
up / suck on my balls, pause, I had
enough / I ain’t thinking ‘bout you”,
the expletive laden line from ‘Sorry’
is about a cheating man, but as well
could be about the mainstream
viewers. Beyoncé’s message is clear:
if you don’t like what I’m saying,feel
free to leave.
In ‘Formation’, Beyoncé sang
about her love of her black features
“I like my baby heir with baby hair
and afros / I like my negro nose with
Jackson Five nostrils”, Lemonade
reveals that such a declaration is not
free from a hinterland of hurt, and
doubt; featuring the fantastically
shade-throwing line “better call
Becky with the good hair”, using
the name ‘Becky’ as a shorthand for
‘white woman’ as she calls out her
husband for cheating on her. In a
heart wrenching, chilling lyric that
follows, Beyoncé tells her lover “If
this what you truly want, I can wear
her skin… over mine / Her hair,
over mine / Her hands as gloves /
Her teeth as confetti”. In doing so,
she articulates a sentiment that has
been explored by many black artists
before her. In a deeply moving
article, Jezebel’s Clover Hope draws
parallels between this line, and Toni
Morrison’s novel‘The Bluest Eye’.In
the novel, a young black girl, Pecola,
is continually told she is ‘ugly’, and
wants more than anything to have a
pair of blue eyes so she can live up to
the white standards of beauty. Toni

issues. In Lemonade, Beyoncé aligns
herself with this self-doubt and
the pain and humiliation it carries,
singing “I’m not too perfect / to ever
feel this worthless”.
Lemonade is a body of work
determined to overthrow that
mantle, not just from Beyoncé, but
all black girls. The videos are filled
with black women, some faces more
familiar than others. In ‘Sorry’,
Beyoncé, in a head full of cornrows,
dances on a bus with women in
Yoruba body paint, a celebration of
the African diaspora. In the same
song, whilst Beyoncé reclines on a
throne,Serena Williams twerks next
to her.There aren’t many artists who
could inspire one of the greatest
living athletes in the world to twerk
for three minutes, but Beyoncé
is one. Later, Quvenzhané Wallis
(Beasts of the Southern Wild, Annie)
appears with Blue Ivy, Beyoncé’s
daughter. Also present are actresses
Amandla Stenberg (The Hunger
Games), Zendaya, model Winnie
Harlow, singers Chloe and Halle
Bailey. Ballet dancer Michaela
dePrince performs beautifully to
‘Freedom’, even Leah Chase, the
‘queen of Creole cooking’, a New
Orleans institution unto herself,
makes an appearance. Of course,
Warsan Shire is ever-present, whose
words, evocative, punchy, and brave,
sculpt the narrative throughout the
album.
The most poignant appearances,
however, are by Michael Brown’s
mother, Lesley McSpadden,
Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sabryna
Fulton, and Eric Garner’s mother,
Gwen Carr, all holding portraits of
their sons who were killed in acts
of police brutality. They hold their
heads up, and look defiantly into
the camera as Kendrick Lamar raps
“Eight blocks left, death is around
the corner / Seven misleadin’
statements ‘bout my persona / Six
headlights wavin’ in my direction
/ Five-O askin’ me what’s in my
possession… mama, don’t cry for
me, ride for me / Try for me, live for
me / Breathe for me, sing for me”.
The Malcolm X speech sampled
earlier in the album, “the most
disrespected person in America
is the black woman, the most
unprotected person in America is
the black woman,the most neglected
your mother / you look everything
like your mother”. Oppression is
generational, “are you thankful /
for the hips that cracked, the deep
velvet of your mother / and her
mother / and her mother / there
is a curse that will be broken”. The
camera pans to a Nina Simone
record. The inference to be made
is clear. Nina Simone, one of
the most incandescent talents of
the twentieth century, lived in a
physically abusive relationship with
her second husband, a man who
beat her, held guns to her head, and
then laughed it off; her talent, her
strength, her charisma could not
save her from violence, from pain.
In Shire’s poetry, men are
“magicians, able to exist in two
places at once”, across generations,
they “come home at 3 AM, and lie”,
they betray, disappoint. Those with
real magic are the women, cursed,
and yet, able to save themselves;
“grandmother, the alchemist / you
spun gold out of this hard life /
conjured beauty from the things left
behind / found healing where it did
not live / discovered the antidote in
your own kitchen / broke the curse
with your own two hands”. The
camera cuts to a home video of Jay
Z’s grandmother, Hattie White’s,
90th
birthday. “I had my up and
downs,” she says, “but I found the
inner strength to get back up. Life
handed me lemons, but I made
lemonade”.
Lemonade, plantations, southern
gothic, cowboys, shotguns, seedy
streets in New Orleans, churches,
parades; these are all images rooted
in the cultural landscape of the
Deep South. In Lemonade, this
landscape is populated with black
women surviving, thriving in a life
that keeps handing them lemons;
they keep making lemonade. This
is Beyoncé’s love letter to these
as confused, but Lemonade is tightly
strung and expertly cohesive.
In one of the first songs, ‘Hold
Up’, Beyoncé throws open the doors
to a courthouse, emerging arms
outstretched, resplendent in yellow
frills, floodwaters cascading around
her down the steps, Botticelli’s
‘The Birth of Venus’ made flesh.
She struts down a downtown street
swinging a baseball bat named
‘Hotsauce’, murderous smile fixed,
smashing classic cars. The song,
with writing credits as varied as
Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig,
MNEK, and Father John Misty,
borrows heavily from The Yeah
Yeah Yeahs’ ‘Maps’; and Soulja
Boy’s ‘Get My Swag On’. What
results is a catchy song with a
distinct reggae twist, reminiscent
of Rihanna’s ‘Man Down’. From
this, we are launched into a series
of songs which sample everything
women, to their whole selves; to
their anger, their joy, their love, their
talent, their magic, their beauty, and
above all, their resilience.
Beyoncé has sung about girl power
before. ‘Irreplaceable’, ‘Independent
Woman’, and ‘Run the World
(Girls)’ come of age as ‘Don’t Hurt
Yourself’: “I’m a fire breathing
dragon / Beautiful mane, I’m the
lion”, “keep your money, I got my
own / Get a bigger smile on my face,
being alone / Bad motherfucker,
God complex”.
The world is waking up to the
reality of Beyoncé as a black artist,
an experience skewered brilliantly
in a recent SNL skit. Of course, she
has always been black, but like so
many minority women, she diluted
her blackness to fit into the cookie
cutter mould society expected
her fit, in order to succeed. Nina
Simone sang “I wish I could break
/ All the chains holdin’ me / I wish
I could say / All the things that I
should say / Say ‘em loud say ‘em
clear / For the whole ‘round world
to hear” and this Beyoncé taking up
the mantle in the way she knows
best. If Beyoncé ever feigned being
‘less awake’, she is plenty woke now.

Morrison writes: “The master had
said, ‘You are ugly people.’They had
looked about themselves and saw
nothing to contradict the statement;
saw, in fact, support for it leaning at
them from every billboard, every
movie, every glance. ‘Yes,’ they had
said. ‘You are right.’ And they took
the ugliness in their hands, threw
it as a mantle over them, and went
about the world with it.”

predominantly white mainstream
media, not struggling with these

album. Beyoncé acknowledges that
sometimes even black communities
are complicit in the oppression of
black women, “are you a slave to the
back of his hand? / Am I talking
about your husband, or your father?”
and she can hardly fail to recognise
that many black male artists, Jay
Z included, rap about racism, and
discrimination even as they rap
about women in demeaning terms.
In Lemonade, patterns keep
repeating. “You look nothing like

Beyoncé

whatever
she wants
political as ‘Formation’, Lemonade,
a glorious celebration of healing,
of self-love, and sisterhood, is in a
class of its own. Lemonade proves
Beyoncé to be an artist at the top
of her game. Others have created
autobiographical music, they have
even brought along their famous
friends for the ride, but most seems
pedestrian, stuck in the little league;
alright, I’ll say it; Beyoncé is a
grown woman; she can do whatever
she wants.
