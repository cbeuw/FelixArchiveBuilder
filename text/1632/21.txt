This week, you're the mole
who's sneaking our scoops
to The T*b. Yeah, we know
you're there. Stop now, and
that'll be the end of it. I will
not look for you, I will not
persue you. But if you don't,
I will look for you, I will find
you, and I will kill you.

This week you're Boris
Johnson. You deride the
Editor for being half-Asian
and therefore being biased
against Zac Goldsmith. Fuck
yeah, she replies, in the form
of an hour long visual album
named "#RubiKhan".
This week you vote to stop
thousands of Syrian children
entering the UK. Yes! Go
you. Nice one. Really great.
Congratulations. How do
you sleep at night? Don't ever
come to our Heart and Lung
Institute ever again, tin man
twat.
This week you watch a trailer
for that Absolutely Fabulous
film, and it is so aggressively
unfunny you lose your sense
of humour forever, like a
sabbatical officers after a rag
magazine.
This week, you're the new
head of communications
at Imperial, and a shouty
Scottish man. You tell the
sabbs they're more useless
than a marzipan dildo before
screaming "Fuckity bye!" at
the President.
This week you are trying to
start a rumour that there is a
glory hole in the SAF men’s
toilets. So I guess tell your
friends or even make one if
you’re that way inclined.
This week you have a secret:
whenever you see the junior
doctors protesting, you start
chanting Jeremy Hunt under
your breath and you get a
rush like no other.He’s pretty
cute as well.
This week you wonder if
Jeremy Hunt is as dreamy as
he looks in the parliamentary
debates.He’s so strong of will;
so cute. He speaks Japanese
as well. The only thing in the
way of me and him is his wife
and three kids.
This week after Beyoncé
dropped that new album
you’re desperately looking
for a torrent because nobody
is paying for Tidal; however,
you never get to listen to it as
too many people are making
jokes about Jay Z having 100
problems and you have to hit
them to shut them up.
This week you have to smash
everybody’s phone who
decided to Snapchat the fact
it was snowing. We know.
We were fucking there and
we saw it. For fuck's sake live
your life.
This week you are slowly
losing your sanity as you
realise that your exams aren’t
until the end of June. You
consider perhaps creating a
detailed revision schedule,but
then realise it would be better
to watch Youtube videos and
masturbate instead.
This week you're Piers
Morgan. Shhhh. That's
better.
