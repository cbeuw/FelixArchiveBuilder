T
he MP for the Fulham
andChelseaconstituency,
where many Imperial
students live, voted on
Monday night not to allow 3000
Syrian refugee children into the UK.
He was one of 294, who voted
against the amendment to the
immigration bill which would have
allowed the unaccompanied minors
who had managed to reach Europe
to come to the UK.
Despite a number of Tory rebels
voting for the change, Greg Hands
was not in this group. The MP
visited Imperial’s Heart and Lung
Institute at the Royal Brompton in
January of this year, and is pictured

Gast. After the visit, Mr Hands
wrote a blog post encouraging
readers to attend Imperial Festival.
The amendment was initially
tabled in the House of Lords by
Alf Dubs, who was smuggled to
England from Nazi Germany
via Kindertransport – a British
government backed scheme to bring
unaccompanied children to this
country to escape the Holocaust.
The amendment cannot be passed
back to the House of Lords as it is
deemed to have cost implications
for the government. Instead, the
Labour party is working on tabling
another amendment that will be
passed to the House of Lords for a
vote in the next few weeks.

Greg Hands is the Conservative representative of Fulham and Chelsea
stepped down earlier this year. Both
of the previous councillors were
Conservative with one being the
new Kensington MP and former
deputy London Mayor, Lady
Borwick.
He hopes to
tackle social
issues in
the borough
should he be
elected
Local MP votes to stop refugee children coming to UK
The ward, which encompasses
most of the area between Cromwell
Road and Kensington High Street
(essentially west of the Cromwell
Road Sainsbury’s), has historically
been a strong Conservative majority
and Ben, last year’s RAG Chair and
former Imperial Labour Society
President, faces an uphill struggle if
he wants to reverse this.
Speaking to FELIX, Fernando
explained that he hopes to tackle
social issues in the borough should
he be elected, namely social
housing, pushing the introduction
of the new Crossrail station on the
King’s Road and the redevelopment
of local schools. Fernando also felt
he could be the fresh face needed to
bring about this change, as well as
being a voice for the young people
of the area.
Having received a letter notifying
him of the vacant position, Ben
threw his hat into the ring but
stressed that this was not the start
of a political career and that he will
still be undertaking his PhD next
year regardless of the outcome.
If elected, Ben would follow in
the footsteps of former Imperial
political alumni, almost a dozen
of whom have gone on to become
British MPs, as well as Rajiv
Gandhi and Julius Vogel,the former
Prime Ministers of India and New
Zealand respectively. Speaking on
his chances Fernando said: “It’s
unlikely but you never know”.
If you do happen to live in the
Abingdon ward, and are registered
to vote in the upcoming elections,
keep a look out for him campaigning
over the coming week as you will
get to decide Ben’s fate on May 5th
.
