B M S planning
difficulties

Permission has still not been
granted for the College to
demolish the RCS II building
which lies behind the Chemistry
Building and is currently being
prepared for demolition.
The location is a critical part
of the Basic Medical Sciences
Building programme. College is
believed to have submitted a
planning application in early
October last year, well in time
for Schal, the College's construc-
tion contractors, to begin demoli-
tion a few weeks from now.
However processing the applica-
tion has taken far longer than the
expected six to eight weeks and
has yet to even reach the agenda
of the Borough Planning
Committee. Planning permission
is only considered after the
Borough checks that laws which
it has a responsibility to maintain
are not broken.
The College has a history of
difficulties in carrying through its
estates' plans. In recent years
there have been complaints from
local residents vehemently
opposed to plans for the con-
struction of additional floors on
top of the Sports Centre. Last
year's centralisation effort, plan-
ning to transfer the Students'
Union to the Sherfield Building,
had to be dropped after intense
lobbying by the Union and stu-
dents.
The Borough's primary
responsibility is to ensure that
safe and healthy environments
are maintained in and around
buildings, and it has statutory
powers to enforce the provisions
of the Building Act (1984) and
the Building Regulations (1991).
It considers factors such as the
history of a site, appeals deci-
sions, Central Government guid-
ance, and local representations in
determining whether or not to
grant permission for develop-
ments.
The College's Planning
Department could not comment
at all on the development, refer-
ring all questions to the Estates
Management Department, who
have assumed responsibility for
the project. Unfortunately M r
Caldwell, the Estates director
and official spokesperson, was
unavailable at the time of going
to press, hence the College's
position is unclear.
London has been subject to
building control since the twelfth
century. The system was
enhanced after the rebuilding
following the 1666 Great Fire of
London and continued through
many revisions of legislation
which culminated in the London
Building Acts of the 1930's.
These Acts and the associated
By-Laws were administered by
the District Surveyors and con-
tinued until 1986 when most of
their provisions were repealed
and replaced by the 1984
Building A c t and associated
Building Regulations. Certain
parts of the London Building
Acts still remain in force though,
and apply in addition to the
Building Regulations.
Student leaders of the med-
ical schools that will make up the
new centre are continuing to
express concern over the lack of
social facilities in the new build-
ing. Their opinions are being con-
sidered by the B M S steering
committee, where they are rep-
resented by I C U President Sarah
White, but it is thought to be
unlikely that any new space will
be made available. The demand
for space in the building is so
tight that the entire structure
would have to be redesigned to
make more room available.

IC's University
Challenge
Imperial College Union has
got through to the second round
in the television quiz show
University Challenge which pits
teams from Universities around
the country in competition test-
ing their general and specialised
knowledge. After a slow start,
which the I C U president
described as 'nervewracking', the
team pulled through and beat St.
Andrew's convincingly.
Newspaper service
ends
Da Vinci's Catering
Department have written to
Felix to explain the situation
regarding the issue of free news-
papers for the use of our cus-
tomers. The service is provided
at a cost of £66 per month and
unfortunately due to the lack of
consideration of some customers
Da Vinci's are no longer pre-
pared to provide it.
They realise that the majori-
ty of customers appreciate the
service and treat it with respect
but a minority continue to abuse
it, stealing the papers, tearing
them up and generally trashing
them. Out of principle and with
apologies to our loyal customers
Da Vinci's have decided to end
the service.
Graduation joy
The time when graduating
meant sitting through thousands
of diplomas being awarded is no
longer. From this year, there are
to be two ceremonies, one in
June and the other in November.
Not enough science
jobs
The United Kingdom is not
employing enough science and
technology graduates in research
and development, according to a
report by the Institute of
Employment Studies.
Only 4.5 people are
employed as researchers per
1000 of the labour force in the
UK. This compares with 5.3 in
France, 6 in Germany and 6.9 in
the U S . The report says that
there is little sign of a strong
demand for new science gradu-
ates and students may be voting
with their feet by not choosing to
study science.
Richard Pearson, the author
of the report, commented that
even if there was a 20% increase
in the number of science jobs
overnight, then the supply of
new graduates would not be a
problem.
Earth gallery opening
The new Earth Galleries at
the Natural History museum will
be opening this summer. The
development will cost £12mil-
lion, half of which will come
from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
When completed, the the build-
ing will have three floors of high-
tech 'earth based exhibitions.
Visitors will enter through an
atrium featuring a giant revolving
globe.
Schal's going all one
way
The more awake among the
regular cyclists to union may
have noticed that a one way sys-
tem has been set up around
union by the Basic Medical
Science contractors, Schal
International. The system will
hopefully regulate the increased
traffic flow due to the construc-
tion of the new building.
IC Professor knighted
Robert May, visiting profes-
sor at IC and chief scientific
advisor, received a knighthood in
this years honours list.
Sir Robert's career has been
very diverse so far, he started as
a chemical engineer, worked in
physics and then crossed over to
biology. In 1973 he made a major
contribution to ecology when he
published a paper in which he
used ideas from chaos theory to
model ecosystems.
