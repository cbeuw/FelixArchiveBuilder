For the first time this week
I really have felt that I have
failed at my job. Yeah, sure it
really wasn't that great when I
succeeded in messing up the
RSM football match results
three weeks on the trot. A n d I
didn't feel particularly proud the
day I realised the Print Unit was
overdrawn (no longer, I assure
youl) But this week I have singu-
larly failed to bring out a paper
with any news in it.
However, there are a num-
ber of critical issues that will
strongly effect the future of our
university hanging in the balance
at the moment. We are told that
we can expect a new Basic
Medical Sciences Building to be
up and running in 18 months.
The fact that not only has con-
struction not started, but that
it's location is still occupied by a
sizeable building suggests to me
that all is not running to plan.
But actually I have no idea.
We know that the con-
stituent medical colleges that
will make it up are worried and
frightened that they will not only
lose their prestigious collegiate
identity, but have no social or
meeting space at all. But I don't
know what's happening about
that.
We know that a massive
overhaul of Imperial's halls of
residence is in the offing. As a
result of this, the future of the
students' union is apparently in
doubt. But I have no idea what's
happening here, either.
No-one from college's
estates or planning departments
will give information. When
Schal, the BMS construction
engineers, were approached, we
were told that they 'weren't
allowed' to talk to us. The cur-
rent policy dictates that only
IC's Estates Director, the clearly
exceptionally busy Ian Caldwell,
is allowed to comment. Having
been unable to get hold of him at
all, Felix is unfortunately this
week somewhat lacking in
answers to questions.

New Year, new brooms,
new resolutions, etc, etc...
Maybe now is the time to write
that review/feature/news article
that you always thought should
have been in Felix. Or taking the
simpler option, if you have any
thoughts on what would help get
you through those Friday morn-
ing lectures, I would love to hear
your suggestions.
