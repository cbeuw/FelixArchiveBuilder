John currin - the new guy and the never ending story photos by fred scruton
at the institute of contemporary arts, the mall, SW1Y 5 A H until 18 february
this is a'witty and clever exhibition, art for the imperial male, maybe his unfeasably large-breasted women
are sexist, but they all seem to be supporting his scraggy and wrinkly men, who seem to be surrounded
by flaccid phallic symbolism, go because you want to discuss the manet and tiepolo connections, or go
because you want to take the phrase 'arty toss' literally.
