IC M E N 1 2 - 1 7 IC W O M E N
From the outset it was obvious
that the world-renowned
I C W A F C were going to domi-
nate play.
At 9pm on Saturday evening
when the game kicked off, the
ladies somewhat outnumbered
the gentlemen. In response to
this, Nigel Helmsley, the flam-
boyant captain of I C A F C sig-
naled to his boys to cower in the
corner and play a defensive game.
Unluckily, even with all the
men's best players present and
playing their hardest, they were
no match for the agile and devi-
ous ladies, who before the main
course had been served had man-
aged to send the boys huddling
together protectively. During the
dessert it was thought for a few
moments that they were going to
pull their game together as sever-
al members of the men's club
started to come out of the
cocoon they had created. But all
their efforts proved fruitless, as
at the end of the night the score
remained at 17 - 12. Yet another
resounding victory for the IC
Ladies Football Club.
This year's individual B U S A
fencing championships took
place at Cardiff University, to
which Imperial College sent a
strong team, with good chances
in all three events (epee, foil and
sabre).
In the first, the epee, the
men's event was entered by
Reuben Kalam and Eddie
Rysdale. Both fenced well to
reach the last 32. In the
women's event though, Liz
Kipling's lack of competition
practice showed when the seed-
ed player, was edged into third
place on the last hit of her semi
final.
After the foil seeding
rounds, three IC fencers (Nick
Manton, Alex Davies and Eddie
Rysdale) had dropped only nine-
teen hits between them, with
Charles Cooper not far behind.
This resulted in L I 6 places for
Charles and Alex, and a place in
the last eight for Eddie.
IC's best results came on
the last day, the sabre competi-
tion, where all the team made
the last sixteen. Charles and
Shafik Saba were unlucky
enough to draw each other in the
quarter finals, but Shafik, a G B R
national squad member, went
through to take the title on the
last hit in the final.
W E N E E D G O L F E R S !
Imperial College Golf Team has
reached the second round of the
BUSA National Championship
despite the seemingly major
problem of it's non-existence.
We at Felix believe our passing
of the first hurdle was by
default, but perhaps not. Who
knows? Anyway, if your game is
up to it, get in touch with Tim
Townend and you might well get
a representative game.
Sailors
Make
Sunsail
Finals
Late November saw seven IC
students achieve what many
before have failed to do: qualify
for the Sunsail Regatta finals.
The team settled down
quickly and gained easy fourth
and second positions in races
one and two on the Saturday.
Sunday saw clear skies, perfect
wind and an overall second
place on which to hold. Some
serious spinnaker mishandling
led to a miserable eighth in the
third race; the final leg though,
with IC's final chances slipping
away, was enough to gain a nail-
biting third place, ensuring their
presence at Port Solent the next
Friday.
Coursework and end of
term exams put a noticeable
strain on selection, and it was a
decidedly mixed crew who
made the trek to the South
Coast. In awful conditions only
two races were run over the
weekend. Despite many of the
twenty boats having hefty and
prominent sponsorship, (the
overall winners were the team
funded by Touche Ross), IC
managed a highly respectable
tenth place. Well done by all.

The under fire England football
manager'Terry Venables has resigned
from his post only months before the
European Championships.
He said "It's not an easy decision to
take, but I have several legal battles to
come up, and it would be very very diffi-
cult to give a full commitment to the task
in hand." The favourite to be his succes-
sor is the current Newcastle boss Kevin
Keegan,
