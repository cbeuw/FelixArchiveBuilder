Applications are invited for the position of Warden at Wilson
House, which is available from April 1996.
Wilson House, situated in Sussex Gardens, is a self-catering
mixed house of approximately 270 students. The Warden will be
responsible for the pastoral care of students and for maintaining
discipline. In return s/he receives rent-free accommodation in a
self-contained flat.
A t present only medical students live in the house but with the
move of pre-clinical students to South Kensington in 1998 a
wider variety of residents will be accommodated. The Warden
will be expected to make a positive contribution to managing this
change.
Application forms and an information pack can be obtained from
Janet Jones, Room 512, Sherfield Building, extension 45536.
Any non-undergraduate member of the college may apply, but
experience of pastoral care of students would be an advantage.
Closing date for the receipt of completed application forms:
7 February 1996.
