hi.
It's not every day that a major record company
pays for your humble Felix music reviewer to go
to Leeds, eat at the Hilton, interview a band, go
to a secret gig, stay overnight in a hotel and then
come back to London. So what was the occa-
sion? Well, York's finest, Shed Seven, are about
to release their hugely anticipated second album.
They believe that it will thrill their devotees and
astound everyone who hears it. Obviously,
Polydor Records thinks so too. I travelled up to
Leeds to meet the band and to see if they could
justify these presumptuous claims...
I caught the train to Leeds and checked into
my hotel room by 5 p.m. I then headed for the
plush surroundings of the Hilton Hotel and, after
a few drinks at the bar and a nice, juicy steak for
dinner (all free, of course), it was time to speak to
Shed Seven vocalist, Rick Witter, and drummer,
Alan Leach...
The interview takes place in their hotel room,
with Rick sitting on a sofa, his expression quite
serious and even contemplative, and Alan seem-
ing less introspective,
with an ever present
grin across his lace.
They've just got back f j:

Echobelly, but as they <
explained, they
enjoyed gigging in the
Far Last the most.
"In Thailand and | m j f l H H H H H
Japan we got gifts from • H H H
fans. In Japan, some of B h H H H H H H H H
the fans actually had g f J B ( B ( B H f l H H
breakdowns at the
gigs. There was never
any stage-diving but the atmosphere was so
intense."
Rick continued: "I also got my first black eye
after a gig when a girl threw a new watch in its
case through the open window of our car."
Not that all touring is as agreeable to them.
The subject of festivals brings back unpleasant
memories, as does the subject of Oasis. Rick is
only willing to say one sentence on the matter:
"We did a headline gig with them in London
once but they were too arsey."
He goes on to claim that it was Shed Seven
who invented Britpop and that he doesn't like
bands just because they are part of a scene. O f the
up and corning bands of the moment, he men-
tions Cast with respect.
We move on to talk of the new album, which
is due out in March. Rick had already comment-
ed in print that 'We couldn't be arsed with all that
'difficult second album' b*****ks, so we've gone
straight on to our third." H e is a little more spe-
cific here:
"It is similar to 'Changegiver' [their success-
ful debut album] but with more instruments and
a better recording so that it's more in yer face. If
you go into a club and hear 'Dolphin' come on
alter Primal Scream's
'Rocks', it sounds tinny
and weak."

atmosphere is electrify-
ing and the energy Rick
generates with his passionate vocals seethes with
intensity.
The night finishes and we're left eagerly
awaiting the new album. Shed Seven - welcome
back!
