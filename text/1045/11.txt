It's been quite a year for the Chemical Brothers.
Their debut album, 'Exit Planet Dust', sold huge
amounts in the U.K. and was rightly acclaimed as
one of the best techno albums of 1995. The sin-
gle 'Leave Home' reached an unprecedented
number 17 in the charts and the tour that fol-
lowed was a sell-out. O n top of all that, they con-
tinue to be rock's favourite remixers - doing their
stuff for, amongst others, Primal Scream, Oasis,
The Prodigy and Leftfield.
Tonight at the Brixton Academy, they show
exacdy why they've come so far so soon with a
blinder of a set. One of the criticisms of 'Exit
Planet Dust' was the duplication of the 'Leave
Home' formula. N o danger of that here. The
weaker tracks are left out, replaced by an encour-
agingly original handful of new ones. The only
shame is that they don't attempt to bring any of
the ethereal vocals in 'Alive Alone' or Tim Burgess'
contribution to 'life is Sweet' into the mix. A l l
that is dropped in favour of a full-on techno
onslaught.
The Prodigy obviously value the Chemical
Brothers as a warm-up act since this isn't the first
time the two bands have played together. Their
eclectic mish-mash of house, hip-hop, dub and
indie-rock is perfect for The Prodigy's crowd. By
the time the set is wound up with an extended
mix of the seminal Chemical Beats' (easily their
best song to date), there's hardly a dry T-shirt or
unraised arm in the house.
The Prodigy's live shows have become near
legendary, thanks largely thanks to a string of sum-
mer festival appearances including Tribal
Gathering, Glastonbury and T in the Park.
They're hardly recognisable as the same teeny
rave act dismissed by the press as a joke outfit fol-
lowing the chart success of the first single,
Charly'. The million dollar question is how liam
and co. are going to follow up their summertime
success? What new visual extravaganza are they
going to throw at us this time? Well, as it turns out,
nothing. But that's about the only disappoint-
ment.
From the moment they open with an
inspired, metal guitar- driven version of Their
Law' that has most of the crowd head-banging like
they were at a Pantera gig, you know that this is
going to be a good one. Keith careers about the
stage like some wild, demented animal, Leroy
does his usual mad dance routine, and Maxim
oversees the carnage, inciting the crowd to new
heights of hysteria with his screams of, "Pay close
attention," and, "Are you here to rock?" O h yeah,
this is cheesier than any Van Halen gig.
Meanwhile, Liam churns out all the classics,
all but hidden behind a mountain of machinery.
'Poison' and 'Out of Space' are definite highlights.
Judging by the number of wide eyed, water bot-
tle clutching nutters around me, there's been
plenty of the former consumed tonight.
This is one of those gigs where you know that
you're witnessing a band at the peak of the career,
where you know that this is as good as it's going to
get - ever. A n d the crowd love it. The Prodigy in
front of their home crowd, winding up their most
successful year so far to create the kind of unified,
triumphant atmosphere that most live acts only
ever dream of.
Brilliant.

After Cream, Hard Times and U p Yer Ronson,
Ministry of Sound have now released a club cash-
in compilation of tracks that were crowd pleasers
there throughout 1995. This set has been mixed
by Boy George and Pete Tong. It features The
Bucketheads, Felix and The Original, to name but
a few, but this album is obvious and pretty tedious
to boot.
And herein lies the problem with this sort of
release: in no way will a dance compilation album
replace a night out. If you're under the impression
that this will transform your sitting room into a
club when you throw a party, then you are sorely
mistaken.
So, an album containing a lot of tracks you
probably akeady own on Dance Zone level 3, vol-
ume 2, '95' but now with added gimmicks. Yes,
a nice imitation leather cover and a free book! If
they think they are going to get away with a bla-
tant marketing ploy like the 32 page pamphlet,
then they've got another thing coming. The book-
let is just full of adverts for various Ministry mer-
chandise and future releases, together with a
review of the year. I would have thought that it
would have been more useful to list formcoming
line ups for '96 insteead of listing what DJ's played
when and where in '95, but what do I know?
Your bog-standard club compilation then, but
if you have half a brain cell then you aren't going
to be fooled by this at all. Buy the Beano annual
instead - it probably contains more information
than the booklet and isn't half as expensive.
