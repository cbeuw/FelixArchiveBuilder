The third trip of the year proved the
existence of the mythical "Indian Summer".
Despite setting off under a cloud of
monstrous pessimism (it was Wales after all)
we were greeted with the most gorgeous
weather, allowing us to climb with minimal
clothing and more importantly display our
rippling physiques (some muscular, others
caused by wind effects on large fat deposits)
to the world.
All members acquitted themselves well
with several new records for hardness and
number of climbs being set. Particularly
good efforts were made by the freshers who
all made impressive leads causing the old
hacks some consternation as their thrones
could soon be in danger. Worthy of mention
are James on Blue Sky, VS; Graham on Sea
Mist, HS; myself (cannot resist) on
Manzoku, E l ; and Simon for soloing
everything in sight. A l l in all an enormously
good time was had, without doubt the best
trip so far and we will definitely be going
back for a second time.
Only one night abseiling epic was
required this time, perhaps marking a
change for the better. The club president
was notable if only by not requiring a rescue,
however in true northern style he made up
for it by allowing himself to be savaged by a
rampant ferret; luckily the offending organ
was merely a finger.
And so we left, our appetites satiated
and the fires of our passion dulled by
exertion. Sadly whilst enjoying the post-
coital ciggy so to speak, the van exploded
somewhat destroying the generated
ambience and resulting in a 6am Monday
morning return to London.
Please feel free to come on a trip; we
promise not to kill you, you'll get do
something more addictive than sex (and
requiring less money) and act like a
complete lunatic. Meetings are held every
Thursday in Southside Upper Lounge at
7pm, if you're lucky the exec will
demonstrate their infamous "act", just back
from a tour of the seedier parts of
Amsterdam; all very distasteful with loads of
wobbling beer-stained naked flesh on show;
no reallyl Seriously I C M C is a free thinking
new age society, we accept all religious
cranks and sexual deviants and we honk at
sexy blokes as well as babes.

All the staff would like to thank you for
your support of our World Aids Day
collection , which helped us to raise £302.12
for our chosen charity - The Mildmay
Mission Hospice for Aids sufferers. The
money was raised from the sale of
Brakspears beer in the Union Bar, entry fees
from last weeks Davinci's trivia night, & the
proceeds from Friday's "Sex on the Beach"
event. A n additional £75 was raised for
Children's Aids Trust through the sale of
Red ribbons. The events were held as part of
ICU Welfare Week.
Letter to Sarah White from Thomas fea
of the Children's A I D S trust:
Dear Sarah,
On behalf of the Childrens A I D S
Trust and all the children that we support,
i would like to thank you for supporting us
on World A I D S Day 1995. Thanks to your
support, we managed to raise £42.71 which
will go straight in to our hardship fund that
provides financial support for the most
needy children. The fund is particularly
over subscribed at this time of the year.
I do hope that your Welfare Awareness
Week went well. We greatly value your
support, and hope that there will be
occasions in the future for Imperial college
to get involved with Childrens A I D S Trust
again. Can I take the opportunity on behalf
of the Childrens A I D S Trust to wish you a
very merry Christmas and a very merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Best Wishes
Thomas Fea

Is your college or university planning to
enter a team event this year? if your team has
got what it takes it could win a unique team-
building training programme, worth
thousands of pounds, that could make all the
difference between winning and losing.
OUTCLASS is a radical new training
process combining the psychology of
teamwork with a series of mental and
physical tasks.
If you think that your team could benefit
from OUTCLASS, and your event takes place
in March '96 or beyond, write to
OUTCLASS, TWP, 5 The Avenue, Richmond,
Surrey TW9 2AL giving brief details about
your team, it's aim, and the event concerned
and we will send you an entry form.
