IC denies nuclear dump allegations
BY A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
College have openly refuted alle-
gations suggesting that IC. dumps
harmful radioactive material. The
article published in Time Out
entitled "Emission Impossible",
which appeared in the Christmas
Double Issue, dealt with
London's licensed nuclear
dumpers, and suggested that IC
disposes of toxic waste in South
Kensington.
The piece highlighted the
dangers of transporting radioac-
tive material through the centre
of the capital, as well as indicat-
ing that London institutions such
as Brunei University, University
College London, and Bart's
Hospital had received enforce-
ment notices from Her Majesty's
Inspectorate of Pollution
(HMIP).
It further claims that
Imperial College "has a licence to
accumulate and dispose of highly
radioactive, liquid, water and
gas", saying that radioactive
material "is often brought down
to London" from the College's
reactor centre in Silwood, near
Ascot in Berkshire. It adds that
radioactive liquids have been
poured down IC's drain and that
radioactive gas has been vented
out from the Beit Building.
Although certain members
of College staff had been
approached by national media -
notably Radio 5 Live - to
respond to the claims, a state-
ment issued by the press office
says IC "has an authorisation
with Her Majesty's Inspectorate
of Pollution to dispose of radioac-
tive waste by various routes, but
the comments in the Time Out
article are factually incorrect."
As Felix was going to press,
Margaret Minski, a director of
the reactor centre at Silwood,
was unable to comment but said
she would be available next week
to respond to the allegations.
'Players'
BY DIPAK G H O S H
Imperial College is trying a radi-
cal new approach to sponsorship
of its sports clubs to generate
funds and save substantial money
on orders of sports equipment.
The company Players has
been chosen by I C U to supply
sports equipment to all sports
clubs for a trial period of six
months. Players is linked to Stac
Sports, and is a big distributor of
sports kit.
Tim Townend, Deputy
President (F&S), expressed his
delight on a good deal for the col-
lege: "This contract has been well
negotiated and we are getting a
good deal from four levels.
'Players' are also very happy to
have got this deal with us. We
have signed a six month contract
with them that takes us to the
end of the present academic
year, and it is very likely that this
contract will be renewed for the
next academic year."
Sports clubs used to put sep-
arate orders with different com-
panies which became too expen-
sive. The new centralised
approach means the Union can
order all sports equipment
through one company, thus sav-
ing money.

A suspect vent in the Biology
building: is I C pumping

for I C U
the probable impact of this con-
tract. He received a provisional
order of £13,500 from eight
clubs, and this means approxi-
mately £2000 in sponsorship
funds at the end of six months.
Players deal with all sports
clothing and equipment and with
a view to renewing the contract
next year, the Union is hoping to
tie in other clubs and societies,
for example, Rag, to supply pro-
motional T-shirts.
The Union is considering
extending this type of initiative
to other areas; one possibility is
the Dram Soc which could have
its stage electrics supplied by the
Whitelights. Another idea for
sponsorship are the mailings to
freshers, which A V M Consulting
already does at other colleges.
The contract was signed on 1
December, under terms that
insist that I C U puts all sports
order to Players, and in return
12% of the total order will be
paid to the Union as a sponsor-
ship fund. Every club which
orders sports kit worth more
than £500 will get a prize of
sports equipment worth £125 for
their Player of the Year award. In
addition, all staff and students
are eligible for a 15% discount on
sports equipment and clothing.

Apart from the obligatory fire alarm, the end-of-term Christmas
bash was another sell-out success. Over 1100 Carnivalites partied
round the three dance floors. "Everyone seemed to think it was one
of the best events we've run," said Ents and Marketing manager
Mark Home.
