Mary's mad cow'
research success
BY DIPAK G H O S H
Initial results of research into
bovine spongiform encephalopa-
thy (BSE) at St Mary's Medical
School may show that it cannot
be transmitted to humans from
cows, amidst concerns caused by
the recent rise in cases of a simi-
lar disease in humans. BSE is a
member of a group of diseases
known as the spongiform
encephalopathies, or prion dis-
eases. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(CJD), the human equivalent of
BSE, it causes a rare and fatal
brain disorder affecting about 1
in a million people worldwide.
This research at St. Mary's is
being carried out by Professor
John Collinge and his colleagues
in the Prion Disease Group,
with collaboration from the
Institute of Psychiatry and the
Central Veterinary Laboratory.
Funding for it was provided by
the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council
(BBSRC), the Wellcome Trust
and the David and Frederick
Barclay Foundation.
This latest research is being
done in the hope of shedding
some more light on whether this
disease can cross the "species
barrier" between humans and
cows. It involves mice genetically
modified to have certain types of
human genes. The idea of this
research is to investigate how
susceptible mice are to BSE
when they have human genes.
So far, although the experi-
ment is not yet complete, the
genetically altered mice are
showing a resistance to infection
from BSE. Professor Collinge
says: "These results are reassur-
ing so far but it is important to
understand that they are the ini-
tial stages in a series of experi-
ments and there is still a long
way to go with these studies."
Professor Collinge and his
group also aim to use these
genetically modified mice to
resolve other questions, such as
to determine whether there are
different "strains" of human pri-
ons.
In the longer term they hope
to study potential therapies for
the human disease in mice.

Today Pimlico, tomorrow the
world... IC's student tutoring
scheme has decided that con-
necting to just Pimlico isn't far
enough.

Israel to visit the Perach project,
Israel's national student tutoring
scheme. She is hoping to bring
ideas back from the Havayeda
programme, a purpose-built cen-
tre which gives children access to
science and technology equip-
ment they wouldn't normally be
able to use at school.

Meanwhile, the Pimlico
Connection is preparing to say
goodbye to it's full-time coordi-
nator, Betty Caplan (second from

V S O in Zambia on February
10th, to teach English in a sec-
ondary school. She will be
replaced by Adrian Hawksworth,
presently in the IC's Schools
Liason department.
The 21-year-old Pimlico
Connection scheme presently
coordinates 120 students who
tutor children in schools around
London.
CBE for Julia Higgins
The Dean of the C & G College
has been made a CBE in the new
year's honours list published last
week. The professor of Polymer
technology was given the award
for her services to science.
