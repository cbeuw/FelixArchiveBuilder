Parking Spaces
Students are reminded that with the loss of

on campus, the College has decided that
I C U will no longer administer student
parking permits. Students should now apply
to their own academic departments for
permits. A l l permits issued last term as
originally stated expired at the end of
December.
Students experiencing difficulties
obtaining help from their department can
contact Sarah White in the I C U office if
necessary.
