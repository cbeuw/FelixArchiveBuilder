Editorial
Apologies, Explanations, and
Frustration...
So, here it is, the Travel Special. Roland,
the Features Editor, has already given his
opinions on the subject of travel in his
mini-editorial on page 4, so I'm not going
to repeat his wisdom.
I am going to apologise to anyone w h o
submitted anything for this issue that
wasn't used. This should have been 28
pages long, but due to unfortunate timing
involving us and paper suppliers, we
didn't have enough paper. E v e n worse, it
isn't anybodies fault, so there's no
potential for a good rant. A n d that's the
bit that's really annoying.
Also due to this lack of space several
things that were promised last issue
haven't been printed. The follow-up to
the article about comics (which was
excellently written...) will be printed next
week, as will the second part of 'Zen
Lawyer', and the new columns (the diary
and the boring lecture forum). A s for that
cat, see below...
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to...?
Yet more new stuff. Starting next week
there will be a semi- regular section
investigating the views of Imperial
students towards important issues, both
within college and without. It takes the
form of a survey, wherein random
students will be asked a question about a
specific subject, and the answers will be
published. If y o u are quizzed, you will be
asked whether or not you m i n d having
your name and/or photo used, which is
totally up to you. The first survey was
run with the question 'Are y o u going to
vote in the ICU sabbatical elections?'.
Should be fun...
Next comes an experiment.
Traditionally Felix does not publish fiction
or poetry, as these have been the domain
of Phoenix. However, Phoenix is only
produced sporadically (about once a
year), and is very under publicised. Thus
Felix will now be open to the publication
of fictional material. There is far too little
emphasis on the arts at this college, and
there needs to be more awareness of art
and literature. So get writing!
Wanted: More Dwarves...
There are some internal changes being
made to Felix, starting this week, in an
effort to make the office more efficient,
and get Felix out without having to stay
up all night! A s such there will be a very
important staff meeting at 12.30 pm
today, in the Felix office.
Staff meetings are NOT just for current
staff. They are the best time for anyone
interested in helping out to come in, as
all the regular bunch will be about. Felix
constantly needs more help, from anyone.
We're not a nasty little clique full of
hacks, we're human (honest. Well, apart
from the odd alien). If needs be I'll get
down on m y hands and knees: HELP!!! In
a college of over 6000 students, there
must be more than a dozen w h o are
interested in what Felix does!
Over a hundred people signed up at the
Freshers Fair last term, so where are you!
Y o u don't even have to be able to write,
or to spell (as Chris is an excellent
example of), Felix can always do with
more people. If you've ever looked at
Felix and thought 'Well, I don't like
that...' or ' W h y didn't they do this...?',
then C O M E IN A N D T E L L US.
PLEASE!!!!
So there you have it: A grown man
reduced to hysterical, last ditch attempts
at getting your attention. A sad example
of the effects of apathy on a (relatively)
sane, idealistic young editor. If you don't
want to hear any more of this kind of
A
S
F
Bit
thing, then y o u k n o w what to do: Give us
a hand...Please!
