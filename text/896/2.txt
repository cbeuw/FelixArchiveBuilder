'The War Comes Home
The H o m e 'Office has given an Iraqi
student at Imperial College twenty-eight
days to leave the United Kingdom. The
student in question sent his passport off
in October, for what should have been an
automatic renewal of his annual visa. He
heard nothing from the H o m e Office for
four months until last Saturday when he
received notice to quit the country.
The letter from the H o m e Office
Immigration and Nationality Department
read as follows, '... your stay has been
extended to 28 days after the date of this
notice. If you do not wish to appeal, you
should leave the United K i n g d o m by that
date.' The letter was stamped '20th
February'.
The student has made the decision to
appeal, and has sought legal advice. The
College Authorities have pledged their full
support. Mr Peter Mee, the College
Registrar, has written two letters on his
behalf, one to the solicitor, co-ordinating
the appeal, and the other to the
immigration department at the H o m e
Office. In the letters, Mr Mee demanded
an explanation for the apparently
unjustifiable deportation action. O n behalf
of the College authorities, he said 'We
will support him as strongly as we can.'
The student said that the whole affair
was having "a severe effect on (his) work'
and that he wanted 'to stay in the
Country long enough to finish (his)
degree'.
Felix respects the anonymity of the
student, for reasons of family and
personal security.

President in
Court
Westminster Council has summoned
Union President, Paul Shanley, to court
for the non-payment of his poll-tax. Mr
Shanley said he was not sure what course
he would pursue but was particularly
unhappy about the Â£26 court costs he
would incur. He did not feel that he was
prepared to go to prison over the matter.
Mr Shanley added that he felt 'gutted'
and exclaimed '..long live Lady Porter!'.
Lady Porter is a staunch Conservative
and heads Westminster Council.
