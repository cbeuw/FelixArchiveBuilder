LETTERS Scribbler's Corner.
A noble
gesture
Dear Andy,
I understand from a friend of mine that
a letter appeared in last week's F E L I X
concerning Reggie the Lion, the mascot
of King's College and I'd like to take this
opportunity to clear up any
misunderstanding and inaccuracies.
1. Reggie's original Wedding Tackle,
now mounted o n a plaque and being
looked after by a King's Engineer at a
hall of residence will soon be kept behind
the bar at King's—alongside IC's military-
dressed teddy-bear.
2. Reggie's present equipment—'he's a
very proud lion'—created by yours truly,
will remain in place until...well, until
further notice!
3. For the immediate future, (Rag W e e k
and Engineers' Ball), Reggie will remain
in a B l security zone at a location in the
college k n o w n to fewer than ten people.
So you lot can't have him! Sorry, lads!
Lots of love from,
Alex Ottway, Defender of Reggie.
The bottom Standards
line
Dear Editor,
Is this pseudonym business a private
function, or can anyone join in? If so,
then I would like to put in m y
contribution.
In your editorial for Felix 892 you
express your annoyance at exams. I too
have heard the arguments for exams—
that they provide an abstract scale
against w h i c h to measure people against,
et al. This set me thinking about what the
College is really for.
After three years here, I have come to
the conclusion that it only exists to
produce automatons to keep our industry
(barely) running; but, primarily, to make
money. Exams provide the cheapest way
to assess students, so profits can be
maximised.
Could there be any other reason?
Yours,
The Wizzard.
and logic
Dear Andy,
I do wish A t h e n a would apply the same
standards to himself/herself/themselves
as she/they/he does (do) to others.
Issue 894 point 2: begins by slagging off
Christians for having arguments on a
premise that the Bible is fiction. Is either
any better than the other?
N o w let's say I want to argue
something w i t h the premise that there is
life after death. Athena w o u l d (I presume)
allow me to state this (after all, there's no
less proof than for—say—the fictional
nature of the Bible). But what if I said
'according to St Paul's first letter to the
Corinthians...' and then stated 'there is life
after death'. Suddenly no good? H m m m ,
novel logic.
However, I do agree with point 2—it's
nice, ordered logic. So, Athena, practice
what you preach, or stop preaching.
Yours sincerely,
Andy Cooksley, Physics 3.
A reply to a reply to another reply
Dear Andy,
A reply, to a reply, to another reply, to
yet more replies to a letter w h i c h may or
may not have been printed in F E L I X a
long time ago.
1. A t h e n a may not be scared enough
not to admit his/her/its name, but how
about the others who write in using
assumed names? A n d even if A t h e n a was
scared, would he/she/it admit it? At this
point for the sake of continuity, I will
refer to Athena as the female gender as
Pallas Athena originally was.
2) Yes, m u c h logic included in
arguments on the letters page is flawed,
or two-faced.
Eg. Athena writes that we would
assume generalisations about her, (i.e. if
she were female, she would be a feminist)
if her name was disclosed.
Fair enough.
But in doing so, she too makes a gross
generalisation in that the average reader
is 'assumptionistic'.
3) W i t h the closure by the editor of a
certain topic which provoked m u c h
heated argument, Athena has kindly
supplied us all with a fresh, new and
challenging one to sink our critical teeth
into, i.e. the historicity of the Bible.
I hope A t h e n a does more work at her
course than in researching her literature,
because if not, she's got quite a bit to do.
Biblical literature is embedded in the
foundation of Middle Eastern history and
as science moves forward in researching
our past, more and more of the Bible is
proved to be valid, if not fact.
Fifty years ago, A b r a h a m was thought
of as being a mythical figure, but now
there is more than enough archeological
evidence to say that he lived on this
earth. Going even further back, there is
an incredible amount of evidence to
suggest that there was a flood and that
there is a wooden boat-like structure
embedded in ice on Mount Ararat,
Turkey, corresponding to the dimensions
specified by G o d to Noah w h e n building
the ark.
Jesus may or may not have walked on
water, depending on what you believe,
but Athena, b y declaring the Bible as
'fiction', is most certainly walking on thin
air.
4) Referring not just to Athena, but
many more w h o hav%«^rjtten in, we can
conclude that all Chrisjjaji^ are
unforgiving, self-righteouo, judgemental,
hypocritical, etc. Thinking of us (yes, I'm
one too) as Victorianists is in itself
archaic.
Yes, all of us fall for at least one of
these quite frequently, but that doesn't
mean we are supposed to. There isn't
enough time or space to deal with all of
them, but taking the subject of
forgiveness, Christians are supposed to
forgive and be compassionate, but we are
also charged (just as we w o u l d be
morally) to point out to someone when
they are doing something blatantly
wrong.
There have been some misunderstood
and misguided letters on both sides,
portraying an uncaring Christian faith, of
which this must be the fault only of
ourselves.
Another criticism of Christians writing
in is not of quoting the Bible, but of not
giving a context or a reason for their
belief in it, or an interpretation of w h y
the person in question might be telling us
to do or not to do something.
5) Agreeing w i t h Athena's views on the
prehensile antics of mascotry and the
solutions suggested, I ask myself, is it the
children who are at risk or the Union
funds and recriminations w e should be
worrying about?
Yours, trying to be Christlike,
Giles Pettit, Mech Eng 1
