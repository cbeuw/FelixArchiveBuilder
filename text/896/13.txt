Goodbye
Mr Mackenzie
—Now we are Married 7"
There is a saying 'if you try hard enough
and long enough you will eventually
succeed'. Give it another ten years and
the Mackenzies might get somewhere.
After five listenings I w o u l d have great
difficulty in remembering a single line
save for 'now we are married' that seems
to constitute the majority of the track.
There is no melody or hook—nothing to
stop you wanting for the needle to reach
the middle.
O n the B side is a track that even 1
would be embarrassed to release, and I'm
about as musical as a deaf lobster.
Please stop trying.

W h o were they?
Tonight's openers, Duh, w e r e not on
the bill and all they were able to provide
was an energetic wall of sound and
plenty of asprin you w o u l d not even have
deciphered their name without looking at
the t-shirts on display—there really wasn't
all that m u c h there.
The disappointments of the evening
were Steelpole Bathtubs. T h e y
successfully managed to lose their finely
w o v e n edge apparent on their albums
amongst the noise w h i c h seemed to
prevail from Duh's somewhat intriguing
performance. If you'd seen them without
expectations you may have survived but I
emerged with all illusions shattered. The
set was so undefined that I was surprised
I could recognise anything.
T h e n the Melvins. No illusions here,
none at all. The Melvins built a 900 foot
high monolith and no one knew quite
how to look at it. W i t h all superflous
guitars removed they've perfected
minimalist thrash metal. T h e sound is
reduced to a 15mph crawl through the
remains of the hardcore crossover.
Crunchingly slow and terminally loud
The Melvins steam on, the bass never
stopping. But the drummer set it up.
Beating out rhythms suitable for the Gods
requiem mass. Dressed only in drumstick
adorned y-fronts and grip-gloves w h i c h he
had taped to his wrists he beat out the
tattoo for the apocolypse.
W h e n the end of the w o r l d comes The
Melvins are producing the soundtrack.

Coming in the middle of the supposed
come-back of guitar based bands, this is
ground that is w e l l travelled. Fortunately
they are big enough to call their mark to
show the way for all those groups lost in
mediocrity.
In years to come when you put this
album on it will still sound fresh and
interesting, something to b u y and a
valuable asset to anyone's collection. One
small gripe; they still seem to be planning
albums for v i n y l uses. Putting a short
track at the end of side one to fill space
and give you warning to change sides is
great, but what if you have a C D player?
It does tend to make things a bit
disjointed, perhaps different order for
different formats? That aside, a great
album. So I think I'll give it four out of
five.

band on AT) who successfully fused
industrial and dance music to create a
near hypnotic effect without too m u c h
repetition. It's difficult to say this about
the Basti album. Alternating between
keyboards and guitars they provide a
tune w h i c h sits loosely on a bassline
which seems the same throughout. The
drums rarely rise to the challenge but
when they do, the result is worth it, a
truly great sound emerges and the
combination of various vocal styles and
samples m a k e you try to listen.
Unfortunately there seems to be no
theme to the album and the whole
package sounds too commercial. They
have enough good songs to have
produced a good single but not an album.

This is the forth album from this four
piece band released by 4 A D and there's
even twelve tracks on it (three goes into
twelve four times?).
It's jam-packed with janging guitars,
energetic drums and vibrant rasping
vocals. Each track unfolds like a moth
opening its wings. A dull melodic
beginning reveals a pandora's box of
delights. Unlike m u c h of today's music
the edges are left rough to give extra
bite, rather than the stale rounded sound
that record companies seem to prefer. I
get the feeling that they w o u l d be a
wonderful a n d exciting act to see live,
relishing in the atmosphere of tension.
The vocals are a maze of riddles and
double meanings making listening a
challenge, not a passive process:
7 throw an egg against the wall, I
watch it break and slide, I see my name.'
Basti
Basti—bit of u n k n o w n here. A l l I k n o w is
that I expected more from a band with
two drummers—a bit of a rarity
nowadays. The album is a n overvamped
through pseudo industrial wasteland
which seems characteristic of m u c h of the
music emerging from the London
hardcore scene. Although mellower than
bands such as Silverfish and Terminal
Cheesecake, Basti still manage to fit the
mould—grunge/thrash guitars with a
mixture of samples and vocals.
The main problem is that for a band
with two drummers they seem to produce
some singularly uninteresting backbeats.
Backbeats w h i c h could liven up some
deadly monotonous tracks.
The first and perhaps best exponents of
this musical ideal were the Beatings (US
