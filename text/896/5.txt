Help at Hand on the
Australian Adventure
Travellers taking time off to see the
increasingly popular sights of Australia
can join a unique new club to provide
them with a helping hand in their first
tricky weeks.
The W o r l d Travellers Club was set
up by two seasoned travellers in
response to the Australian tourism
boom which is fast making the country
the world's number one long-stay
destination. Since 1983 for example,
the number of British and Irish
travelling to the land 'down under' has
more than doubled from 1 26,880 in
1982-83 to 256,454 in 1988-89.
Leigh Harris and Amanda Galbraith,
the co-founders of the WTC, have
developed a safety package which
assists travellers of all ages both
working their passage and simply
holidaying to have a more enjoyable
hassle-free experience.
This system allows travellers to
organise a free airport pick-up and
book accommodation in their Australian
destination before leaving home. This
is followed by a complimentary
orientation tour or Sydney Harbour
Cruise. Once in the Sydney WTC
office, travellers are assisted with tax
file number registration —essential for
working holiday makers and medicare
cover. WTC staff also help with job
and flat hunting and provide a long
term luggage storage facility. For
people on the move, the W T C offers a
permanent postal address and
telephone number from which mail and
messages can be held in our office or
forwarded to the travellers next port of
call.
The first of its kind, the World
Travellers Club, has been operating for
over a year in Australia, ten months in
Britain and will shortly be networking
throughout Australia and into Thailand
and New Zealand.
Life membership can be obtianed in
Britain for a fee of £30 for a single
person or £50 for two people travelling
together. Members are also entitled to
reduced rates for secretarial services,
complimentary introductory drinks in
local restaurants and even free
surfboard rental!
For £52 per person or £101 for two
the WTC will include the first three
nights accommodation—in a budget
hotel owned and operated by the
WTC —in our membership package.
In Sydney the WTC has a travel
agency and information bureau. Here
Concorde House, 18 Margaret Street
Brighton, East Sussex BN2 1TS
Telephone: (0273) 672262
you can book your rail, air or bus ticket
to every destination in Australia and
overseas.
At the moment we are the sole
agency in Sydney offering car
insurance specifically catering for
travellers who are non-residents.
The latest addition under our
umbrella organisation is the World
Travellers News. This is our newly
developing free fortnightly publication
aimed at both overseas and budget
Australian travellers. The World
Travellers News is full of information
on what's happening 'at home' with
current affairs, sports and
entertainments news, from Europe,
Candada, USA, New Zealand and Asia.
Travel features and tips, financial
column and classifieds also what's on
and where to go in Australia and other
features. All in all a good read.
The whole idea of the World
Travellers Club is to provide a quality
service which travellers want to use, at
a reasonable cost. Also to provide
some security for travellers without
being obtrusive or too much like a
'package holiday'.
