Travelling on the cheap isn't always fun.
IRAN EL Istanbul Blues
Easing the weight off m y injured foot, I
leant on the reception desk. A weather-
beaten biblical face peered u p from his
paper.
'Dormitory...', I began. T h e stubbly face
remained blank, '...kac lira?', I continued.
'Bes bin...' came the muffled reply barked
through his thick black moustache.
I paid in advance, a n d left m y passport
as requested. T h e moustache ventured
out from his desk and beckoned as he
headed for a battered, handle-less door in
the corner. K i c k i n g it open, he descended
into the gloom of a Tolkein style
dungeon. A solitary sky-light illuminated
the flaking, rancid walls w h i c h curled
d o w n to the hotel cellar. T h e stairs
flowed into an irregularly-shaped grotto
swamped by a slag-heap of black dusty
rubble. M y guide stepped off the final
stair into the filth. I hobbled in his wake.
He opened the door in front of him. It
revealed a r o o m that w o u l d comfortably
have held one double b e d , but was
crowded by the four double bunks w h i c h
lined the walls a n d windows. A shredded,
green, cobweb-coated mosquito mesh
hung limply across each tarnished pane.
T w o millennium of Constantinople grime
caked the glass a n d tainted the twilight.
'This one... or this one' m u m b l e d the
moustache, gesturing to t w o bunks w h i c h
already had rucksacks strewn over them.
'They move out today,' he assured me.
The little dungeon master scuttled back
upstairs to lie in wait for some more
budget travellers.
The squalid appearance of the little
r o o m was eased by its inmates. T h e
bunks were home to a b u n c h of
backpackers, modern-day explorers
trading traveller's tales of hash-hazed
felucca trips d o w n the Nile, of pre-
Tiananmen China, and of Top Deck travel
throughout Eastern Europe.
I sunk onto a soiled sheet and released
m y throbbing foot from the scuffed
baseball boot. The insignificant blister of
three weeks ago h a d turned septic. N o w
the hot anger of infection throbbed
through m y weary nerves. The swollen
festering foot intrigued m y room-mates.
Something else to record i n their travel
logs, no doubt!
In impeccable English, a Swedish medic
volunteered his services. After some
painful prodding, he offered to lance it.
A n Australian graphic designer donated
the scalpel a n d some antibiotics. The foot
was bathed, the scalpel burnt, a n d the
Swede scrubbed up.
I lay back o n the lumpy mattress, a
towel gripped between m y teeth. Gazing
up at the sagging, stained mattress above
me, 1 stifled m y first scream...
