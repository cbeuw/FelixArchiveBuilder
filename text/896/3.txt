Felix, and since the start of this academic
year has been studying English at Q M W ,
whilst continuing with Felix.
W h e n asked about his reaction to the
result, A d a m said 'I'd feel pretty damn
good if I didn't have the flu...'. He plans
to make Cub more regular and increase
its quality, drawing on his experience at
Felix, and is in the process of arranging
for Cub to printed by the ICU Print Unit.
A d a m has done a huge amount of work
for Felix this year, despite having to
travel for an hour and a half to get to the
office. A n d y Butcher, Felix Editor, said of
A d a m 'He's a total super hero, and
deserves a medal. Besides, he reads the
same comics as me!'
The Felix staff wish A d a m all the best
for the coming year.

Cancellation
The Gulf War debate has been cancelled.
The debate was being organised jointly
by IC Anti-War in the Gulf (AWG) and
ICU Y o u t h Peace Through N A T O Society
(YPTN), on the left and right of the
political spectrum respectively.
A W G had already collected the one
hundred and fifty signatures necessary to
call a Union Extraordinary General
Meeting. At the suggestion of the IC
Union President, Paul Shanley, the A W G
decided to hold Union Extraordinary
General Meeting at the end of the debate.
A W G could then propse a motion to be
adopted as the official ICU line on the
'Gulf Issue'. Y P T N said that they found it
'... unacceptable that ICU should officially
support any single view on the Gulf
War...'
Y P T N have withdrawn their goodwill
from the debate and have cancelled the
appearance of Conservative M P Terry
Dicks who was due to speak.
Resignation
Geoff Reeves, Head of College security,
resigned this week. Mr Reeves, 64,
planned to retire next year, but felt that
he would have too little time left to see
through changes in college security that
are currently being mooted.
Mr Reeves recalled that when he took
up his post eleven years ago, after thirty-
three years w i t h the Metropolitan Police
Force, he inherited a newly changed
security system. Mr Reeves said that he
did not want his successor to inherit 'half-
baked change'.
Apology
Last week's report on the arrest of man
in Garden Hall on suspicion of a bicycle
theft was inaccurate. W e stated that M r
W o n g was happy to purchase what he
suspected was a stolen bike. Mr W o n g
claims that he was part of a 'set-up' that
he and another student had organised to
trap the man suspected of other thefts in
Garden Hall.
M r W o n g had been approached by the
man who was trying to sell the bike in
question. The hall authorities contacted
the police who instructed M r W o n g to go
head with buying the bike, as this would
incriminate the suspected thief. The man
was duly arrested but because the police
were unable to prove that the bike was
stolen the m a n was released without
charge.
