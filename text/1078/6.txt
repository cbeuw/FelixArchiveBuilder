6 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 7TH FEBRUARY
Alan Clark, the new MP for K&C?
N E W S T E A M
Thanks to the drunken antics of sit-
ting M P Nicholas Scott, the
Kensington and Chelsea
Conservative Association have been
forced to select a new candidate for
the imminent General Election.
Faced with a maximum of three
months in which to build up support
and popularity, this clearly is a tough
job for any replacement - although
Sir Nicholas' large majority in 1992
provides a huge safety-net.
Consequently, they have selected
Alan Clark, a candidate whose very
name brings instant recognition
amongst the voters of SW7.
Mr Clark, infamous former
Cabinet Minister and ardent
Thatcherite, retired at the last elec-
tion, despising the successors to
Margearet Thatcher (whom he
described as "the most attractive
woman in politics"). However, hav-
ing failed to secure a peerage, and
seeing the prosecution case in the
Arms to Iraq inquiry (in which he
was heavily implicated) collapse, he
has been chaffing at the bit to return
to the Commons. He unsuccessfully
launched a bid to become the official
candidate for the Newbury by-elec-
tion in 1993, and has recently been
scouting for possible seats for the
forthcoming election - all without
success.
Having finally found himself a
candidature (and, considering the
size of the majority which he
defends, a virtually assured place in
the next parliament) he promises to
keep the spotlight on Kensington &
Chelsea. His reputation, as an wom-
aniser and impetuous radical kept
him in the glare of publicity through-
out the late eighties, and was well
founded. His affairs were legendary,
including one weekend when he slept
with a high-court judge's wife and
his daughter. His wife even admits to
his having taken his girlfriend
Christina on their honeymoon.
Alan Clark's career as a minister
was no less colourful. Whilst a junior
minister at the Department of
Employment in 1985, he described
the Third World in somewhat un-PC
term "Bongo-Bongo land". His time

ing the future now he has secured
the Conservative nomination for
Kensington & Cheksea.
as Minister of Trade, from 1986 -
1989, included the Arms to Iraq deal-
ings with Matrix Churchill, whom he
advised to emphasise the general
uses of machine tools, rather than
their specific uses in Iraq. Even the
normally quiet role of Minister of
State for Defence took on a whole
new life under Clark, thanks largely
to his dislike of NATO as a whole,
his ardent nationalism, and the out-
break of the Gulf War.
However, Clark's appointment is
also indicative of the current shift to
the right in the Tory party, with
Clark's politics far more reactionary
than those of the more reserved Scott.
Sir Nicholas was a confessed
Europhile, lying on his party's more
liberal left-wing, whereas Alan Clark
has been described as a "radical reac-
tionary British nationalist", and has
spoken out in favour of protectionism
and industrial intervention. He comes
from a background to match these
beliefs: his homes include Saltwood
Castle and a chalet in the Alps, he has
a passion for fast cars, and to pay his
tax bill he was forced to sell one of
his Turner's.
Although he is unlikely to find a
place in the next government, his pol-
itics vary wildly, and his exploits
make him a friend of any tabloid edi-
tor, Mr Clark does however have at
least one thing in common with
Nicky Scott - he already has two con-
victions for driving offences.
