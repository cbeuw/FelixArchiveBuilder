Trainer, maintains that despite this
many students are under the impres-
sion that they would receive a
Council Tax bill if they did register.
A second reason offered as to why
almost 2 million young people
neglected to vote in the last general
election is apathy. Students who live
in a world free from council tax and
income tax feel detached from the
rest of the voting population.
From birth until now, the particu-
lar flavour of political party in power
has never really affected them. The
fact that they are now entitled to vote
seems irrelevant when they are
locked away inside large academic
institutions. However, students
should not feel like a tiny minority -
all the political parties accept that
student votes will be crucial in the
general election. The applies particu-
larly to constituencies where the sit-
ting M P has a slim majority and a
large student populaiton. Both the
Conservative and Labour parties
have identified twelve or more seats
where their MPs could be ousted by
the student vote. In fact, Health
Secretary Stephen Dorrell was
reportedly so concerned about the
student vote in his seat of
Loughborough, despite a majority of
almost 11,000, that he switched to
the safer Charnwood. Luckily for
incoming Kensington and Chelsea
candidate, Alan Clark, the
Conservative majority of over
30,000 is likely to swamp any vote
by Imperial College students.
The recent 'Rock The Vote' cam-
paign, supported by the NUS and
various celebrities, was aimed to
encourage students to vote. The NUS
is careful to be non-partisan, claim-
ing that they "are not worried who
students vote for, as long as they
exercise their right to vote".
Estimates suggest that around
250,000 extra students have regis-
tered as a result.
The final reason is the growing
doubt expressed by some students in
'the system'. Many students who are
politically orientated, and would like
to vote, feel that none of the major
parties appear to represent students to
their satisfaction. With this in mind,
they would prefer to abstain rather
than make a choice which represents
a compromise. MATTHEW BENNETT
The end may be in sight for the long-
running pay dispute between the
Universities and Colleges Employers
Association and eight trade unions,
led by the Association of University
Teachers, which threatened to dis-
rupt exam and admissions proce-
dures for universities in the United
Kingdom later this year.
The dispute started in June 1996
with an offer of a pay rise to univer-
sity teaching staff of 1.5%. This was
rejected and in protest various boy-
cotts initiated, including a boycott of
the Teaching Quality Assessment
exercise. When no agreement was
reached, the A U T and seven other
unions organised a joint strike which
took place in November last year,
closing many universities completely
and shutting down many depart-
ments at IC.
Earlier this month, AUT members
were balloted on whether they
should take further action. The move
would have meant that exams would
not be marked and admissions proce-
dures would be delayed, both of
which were seen as very serious
threats to the running of institutions.
The ballot came back with a massive
majority of over 75% voting to esca-
late the disruption to universities.
Union officials met with the
employers on 30th January who
offered a new pay deal of 2.9% for
the next two years. After this meet-
ing, the first since June 1996, the
A U T committee voted to advise
members to accept the new pay
arrangement. A ballot has been sent
out to union members on whether to
accept the offer. If the vote comes
back 'yes' then all action against uni-
versities will be ended, and the pay
offer formally accepted. If the vote is
returned with a majority of members
voting against the offer, then the
action against universities will con-
tinue and possibly be stepped up.
One major concession to the
unions has been the support from the
universities Vice Chancellors and
Principles for the formation of an
independent Pay Review Body that
would settle future pay disputes at a
national level. This has been avoided
by universities for some time, and
was the major concession in the talks
last Thursday, as the pay offer did
not change substantially.
Imperial was always able to pay
staff more, and had indeed budgeted
for a pay rise of around 4% for its
staff, but its hands were tied by the
National bargaining rules. Some
other universities or colleges may
find it harder to increase the pay of
existing staff, but some of the pres-
sure was alleviated with an increase
of funding for higher education in the
November budget. Many had
thought that there would be a cut in
funding, which was why the first pay
offer was so low.
