Academic Affairs Committee
Residences Committee
and others
I
Certain others are involved in the academic administration of the college who
"cannot easily be involved within the structure shown above. Among these are
the College Tutors, bless 'em, who, I am told, are the unsung heroes of the
College. Their job is basically to put things right when they go wrong. Then
there are the many committees, appointed either by the Governing Body or the
Rector, many of which, such as the Information Systems Strategy Committee,
the Health and Safety Council and the Student Residences Committee, can have
great impact on the lives of students and staff.
