I shall deal with the very important
business first. Due to a technical
error last week, the thrust of my final
point about Southside became a tad
garbled. The piece as written implies
that I am advocating the consump-
tion of cream beers, such as Caffreys.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. These insidious creations are
the bodily fluids of Beelzebub him-
self. Wouldn't touch them with a
bargepole, mate. I was, of course,
referring to the unsurpassed range of
proper real ales on offer. I thought I
better make that clear, lest anyone
think I have taken leave of my sens-
es (no sniggering at the back, thank
you).
It would seem that the Library is the
centre of attention once again for all
the wrong reasons. First we had the
water leak that knocked out the elec-
trical supply to Sherfield. My dear
friend Keith Reynolds, Head of Fire
and Security, said that this presented
no danger. No Danger? Did not the
loss of power and subsequent battery
exhaustion mean that the Chemistry
explosion was not indicated in
Sherfield? This is not the first time
that his comments looks unnerving.
A reassurance from Mr Reynolds
usually leads me to assume the foetus
position under a stout table and pray
for salvation. The other problem con-
cerns the closure. This has under-
standably irritated our biological
friends, coming as it does in their
revision period. On a personal level,
my degree of sympathy for them is
slightly reduced by the racket I had to

people. The
whole project timing has been a
shambles. While it would be naive to
expect no inconvenience, the major
works could have been organised a
little better. Exam dates are, give or
take a day or two, written in stone. It
is not therefore unreasonable to
expect the boys and girls at Schal and
College Estates to take them into
account.
If the project had started a mere
month earlier this would have coin-
cided with
Christmas, a
slack period for
the library.

It was nice to see that the Europe
debate has become fractionally less
hazy, with speeches from Robin
Cook, espousing E M U , and John
Major going as far in the opposite
direction as Ken Clarke will allow
him. Make no mistake, the man who
decides E U policy in the Cabinet is
not the Prime Minister.
If the debate continues, the public
will at last have some sort of choice
on what could be the most important
decision taken since the War. It also
throws the Conservatives a lifeline.
Every poll conducted indicates wide-
spread public opposition to closer
union, both here and abroad. Though
most should be taken with a large
pinch of the white stuff, the trend is
clear. Parties so out of step with pub-
lic opinion on major issues have two
choices- change policy or move to
the Opposition benches. The public
realise that E M U is fatally flawed,
albeit for reasons of varying validity.
The Conservatives should stop beat-
ing about the bush, and if that means
losing a chancellor, even a good one,
so be it. The economy is at stake.
The Weekly Poem
(supplied by PoetIC)
They
"Come", they said to you and me,
"We will protect you, help you see."
"Protect us from what?", said we.
"From a world of sin and degradation,
Torture sod humiliation,
Diseases, hatred, open sores,
Look at chew and see them pour
Their badness into humankind.
They capture them and make them blind
To goodness, joy and charity,
Happiness and sympathy,
Come along with us and we
Will clear your minds and help you see."
"Who are they?", said we.
"Who they are it matters not,
You'll find out if you are caught.
Come with us and you'll be safe
From their jealousy and hate.
You'll live with us and make new friends,
Your new-found joy will never end,
And we will live in purity,
Till badness dies and we are free."
You smiled at them and I could see,
Your mind was captured with their plea.
"I'm going with them, will you come?"
You asked we, but I had to run
Away from you, and down a road
That I chose, I and I alone,
And now I've found my destiny,
And I am happy, I am free.
Except...
I still love you, and you me,
But wore than friends we cannot be,
For I am one of them, it seems,
And I am bad, uncouth, unclean,
Unworthy of your precious love,
Not faithful (or not weak) enough,
But I know one thing to be true,
That they are chose that are not you.
