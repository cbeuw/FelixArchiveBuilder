IC Birds draw with midgets in the
Battle of the Babes
ICFB overcame their hangovers on
Sunday morning to turn out against a
petite, begrudging St George's team
at Harrington. Let down badly by
their Old Boy referee, they were off
to a poor start as the opposition
coach reluctantly took to the field.
Despite finding themselves one bird
and one goal down early on, spirits
soared amongst the IC players as
they bounded, yelling through the
midfield. An energetic but fruitless
period followed: Hege, Steph and
Eleanor kept control in defence and
determined midfield worded hard,
but luckless strikers Maryam and
Juliet "Baby" were thwarted by the
charging dwarves. Captain Young??
fought back in best Scots
"Braveheart" style and left plenty of
marks on defenders, if not on goal. It
tool opportunistic Mary's medic
Hyena to exploit the dopey George's
goalie early in the second half and
rouse the IC girls to greater efforts.
Smooth play from Tracey "Coach"
Williams and Ioanna, and all-round
coverage from Helen saw IC with
most of the possesseon but few
chances on goal. Frenzied last-ditch
bursts from St George's midfield
stretched some desperate defending
but the score remained even and a
freezing Bente got little chance to
display her goalkeeping skill. IC cel-
ebrated their point with a ball-sign-
ing session on the way home
ICWFC 1 - 1 St George's Medical
School
Fourth team not perfect - shock
Despite winning, IC fourths cannot
be happy with this performance
which, to be honest, was dire (rear!)
It was perhaps our worst perfor-
mance of the season but at least three
points were achieved to maintain our
place at the top of our division. If we
can play this badly yet still win, what
will we achieve if we play well?
An own goal by Sion following
poor play be 'keeper Stu meant we
went one down. A scramble in the
QM box lead to another og but this
time an equaliser for IC. Perhaps the
turning point occurred when the Q M
striker missed an open net from five
yards. This was unsportingly cheered
by the 'keeper to such an extent that
the said striker totally lost his confi-
dence for the rest of the game.
Pete scored from a well worked
three-man move but yet again sloppy
defending brought Q M level. Just as
time was running out David moved
forward from defence and placed a
twenty-five yard chip into the top
corner to win the points for IC.
Despite the score, the game had
been frankly poor from the team
point of view. The defending was
abysmal, the goalie was unwilling to
claim any ball outside the six yard
box, wasteful finishing from the
strikers and worse from the midfield.
Even in this mire of mediocrity, Sion
managed to stand out with an own
goal and a penalty blasted over the
bar.
Let's hope that it will be Winsday
in BUSA.
IC fourths 3 - 2 QMWC
Sport i n brief
SNOOKER
Last Sunday Imperial played a
friendly against B U S A champi-
onship hosts Warwick. After consec-
utive wins against Cardiff,
Southampton and Bristol, IC were
looking to keep up their red-hot
form. For the A team Jon led the
way, winning 5-0 and finishing one
frame with a 60 clearance. Wins fol-
lowed from Simon and Alex, con-
tributing to a final 16-9 win.
For the B team Spike whitewashed
his opponents 5-0 and with a 4-1 vic-
tory for Russell they cruised to a 13-
7 win. With only a couple of weeks
to go before the Nationals, IC are in
good shape for the biggest tourna-
ment of the year.
RIFLE A N D PISTOL
SHOOTING
More competitors are still needed
for the Courtman Shield rifle match
(March 1st) however, as otherwise
RCS are in sever danger of white-
washing all the other CCU's.
Furthermore, anyone is invited to
take part in the Bell Target air rifle
shoot (an old Black Country tradi-
tion) on Wednesday 12th February.
Enquires can be made at the range
on Wednesdays and Saturdays about
other forthcoming attractions.
Finally, we have a home match
against Cambridge on Saturday as a
warm-up for the Nationals, where we
hope to make it into the medals after
last years fourth place.

Felix's regular "external" sports column by the ever tal-
ented and good-looking Dave Robinson.
Earlier this week UEFA decided to
back Germany as the European bid
for the World Cup in 2006.
Although it is FIFA that decides it is
likely that they will be heavily influ-
enced by the decision. The only
other nation even interested is Brazil
and the World Cup has been over the
Atlantic since 1982. This all means
that the most successful bid from
Europe will probably win. The rul-
ing authority seems to think it can
decide who this will be.
England has the most money, best
stadiums and also the most sporting
players and crowds. The FA could
easily strengthen our already sub-
stantial bid. Firstly they could alter
it to one from the United Kingdom,
this would give it the cosmopolitan
air that they seem to want and not
commit it to one country. Fixtures
could be played at the new Hampden
Park and Cardiff Arms Park
Stadiums even if Wales and
Scotland didn't qualify. The Welsh
and Scottish authorities aren't exact-
ly going to object since they have no
chance of ever staging anything
except from Rugby. Secondly they
could state exactly how much cash is
available and bugger the
Bundesbank backwards, the
Lotteries' coffers are overflowing
and it has to go somewhere. Instead
of letting Graham Kelly huff, they
should be busily pointing out the
progress of this countries game, the
success of Euro' 96 and the present
dominance of our sides in Europe.
We could reveal secret plans to allo-
cate more tickets to our 'guests'
from abroad, plans for hospitality of
away fans and guarantees of cheap
seats at every game. I doubt UEFA
will change their mind since the
chairman of the decision committee
and the chief secretary are both
strangely German, but hopefully
FIFA will see sense.
On the domestic scene, it is pleas-
ing to see that Newcastle and
Liverpool have yet again been rele-
gated to also-rans unable to win any-
thing, the only likely title challenge
will come from Arsenal as the Red
Devils romp to a third double.
Stockport are a pretty solid bet for
the cup, seeing how Middlesborough
struggled against Hednesford it is
not beyond them to get to the final
and surprise everyone by staking a
place in Europe. The treatment
given to this trophy is ludicrous, for
all but the big four it is the most
direct and easiest way into Europe
and a first round tie with some
plucky Swedish part-timers, yet no
one seems to care till the quarter
finals.
While our cricketers would
improve their record by coming
home, our Rugby team seem to be on
their way to a crushing Grand Slam.
Although initially uncertain our
national side is going in the right
direction, the killer instinct present
in destroying Scotland has been
sadly missing recently. They are
expected to take the triple crown and
the only true test will be against the
French. M y only uncertainty would
be over the captaincy, Jack Rowell
must now relegate one of his best
two centres to the bench every game.
However who can complain if we
continue to win so well ?
IC fifths beaten by peasants
On Saturday, IC fifths, down to ten
players thanks to third team captain
Pereira's lack of organisation, were
defeated by King's fifths - who must
surely be the ugliest team in the
league.
The first half was even, despite
Flossy's inch-perfect through-pass to
the opposition centre forward, but
the second half was pretty much one-
way traffic, resulting in an unfortu-
nate loss to an unfortunate team.
Credit must go to Kublai, twenty-
one last Sunday, playing up front by
himself for much of the game, and to
Steve, Dan, Gine and Mike who all
worked hard.
IC fifths 0 - 3 King's fifths
An apology:
Sorry to the members of the ski team
who's names where erroneously
spelt in the report which apperared in
the last issue.
The triumphant skiers' are actually:
