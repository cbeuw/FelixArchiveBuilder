Sabbatical election season kicks off
Glaxo-
Wellcome to
pull out of
research i n U K
KATY N O L A N
Glaxo-Wellcome, a major funder of
many research projects at U K univer-
sities, has signal its intention to shift
more of its funding to overseas insti-
tutions. The company currently sup-
plies nearly a quarter of all medical
research funding in the U K
The company blames the poor
research facilities at some universi-
ties as reasons for the switch and par-
ticularly the research environments.
A spokesman for the company
explained that U K universities "lack
the enviroment where you could get
full results."
He went on to place Glaxo-
Wellcome as "an internatonal organ-
isation in an international industry."
Thus, he concluded, Glaxo-
Wellcome needed world-class
research facilities. "We have to find
our research science and technology
in the best centres. Where we would
hope that this would be in the United
Kingdom, it is not a foregone conclu-
sion" he said.
While it seems that many smaller
universities may lose out, staff at
Imperial College do not think that
departments here will be affected by
Glaxo Wellcome's actions. Dr David
Chapman, Finance Administrator for
the Biochemistry Department, com-
mented "I don't think this will affect
us as we have always had very close
relatons with Glaxo-Wellcome, and a
lot of our students have placements
with them. They were also a signifi-
cant contributor to the £2.1 million
cryoelectron microscope that is to be
installed here. We work to follow the
College's mission statement, and be
a centre not just of national, but
international excellence."
The sabbatical election season got
off to a slow start this week with only
two nominations being posted by the
time Felix went to press. Papers for
nominations for the sabbatical elec-
tions went up outside the Union
Office in the Beit Quad Union
Building on Monday morning and
will remain up until 5.00pm Friday
evening.
So far the only posts that have
received nominations are Deputy
President (Finance & Services) and
Felix Editor. 4th year mechanical
engineer Duncan Tindall is fully
signed up for the former, while third
year physicist Jeremy Thomson is
standing for the latter. To be elegible
to stand, a candidate must be a full
member of Imperial College Union,
which all students at IC are, support-
ed by twenty seconders and must
find someone brave enough to pro-
pose them.
The other two positions open for
election are President and Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies).
Potentially, there is a fifth sabbati-
cal recently established to cover the
medical merger. Unlike the first four,
this post is funded from external
sources, such as the St Mary's old
boys association, as is not elected by
campus wide ballot. It is thought that
this year may see the first sabbatical
taken by a medical student.
