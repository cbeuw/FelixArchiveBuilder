Medics secure
independence
KENT YIP
Medical students at St Mary's
Hospital Medical School were cele-
brating this week after securing the
future students' union's financial
independence. During a question and
answer session for medical students
last Monday, Professor Alan
Swanson, Deputy Rector of Imperial
College, said that he saw no reason
why the Student Union of the future
Imperial College School of Medicine
would not be funded separately from
the main Union after the merger.
Further backing came from their
Dean Professor John Caldwell, who
has written to Professor Swanson to
urge him to have his promise offi-
cially noted.
Whilst at present the student
unions of RSM, RCS and C & G are
funded by Imperial College Union,
that of St Mary's receives its subven-
tion directly from the College. There
has been fear that this practice may
be abandoned after 1998, when the
pre-clinical undergraduates will be
taught in South Kensington. Such a
move would have presented a severe
financial blow to the future ICSM
SU, who might receive only £15,000
from ICU. Currently, the combined
subvention of the two medics'
unions, St Mary's and CXWMS's,
stands at £80,000.
At the meeting, Professor
Swanson also stated that the College
would not object to the medics enter-
ing their own teams in future BUSA
competitions, and this would be a
matter for the students concerned to
sort out. The question as to whether
the College would continue to fund
the teams elicited the reply that no
changes to the present system of
funding would be introduced. It was
pointed out, however, that when
making decisions on such matters
one should consider how to get the
best level of competition.
Questions concerning the shape to
be taken by the crest of the future
medical school, which will appear on
the jersey of the various sport teams,
were also posed. Again, it was
promised by Professor Swanson that
the College would back whatever the
medics from the four constituent
medical schools agree on.
After the merger, first year medics
will be housed in halls of residence
over at South Kensington. This has
led to fears that Wilson House,
which has always been a hall for
medical students, will be opened up
to students from other disciplines,
and result in final year clinical stu-
dents loosing their priority when
applying for rooms there. Professor
Swanson assured the medics that all
clinical finalists will still be given
priority at Wilson House.
When asked to clarify the recent
suggestions that residents of Wilson
House may have their parking rights
outside the house removed,
Professor Swanson said that he was
not aware of any such plan. He
agreed that it would be unreasonable
to remove the parking rights of clini-
cal students, who have to undertake
their training in many different loca-
tions around and outside London
throughout the duration of their
course. Professor Swanson also said
that he saw no reason why residents
of Wilson House should not be
allowed to keep their belongings in
their rooms for a nominal fee during

Students - Can't vote,
won't vote?
MICHAEL ROBERTS
Students throughout the country
appear to be waiving their right to
vote, according to a recent article in
The Times. Despite eligibility they
appear not to wish to go to the ballots
for three main reasons.
The first is that they fear that by
registering with their local council
they will become liable to pay
Council Tax and cause further strain
on already stretched grants and
loans. Normally students are exempt
from paying the tax but conflict aris-
es for those who share a house or flat
with someone receiving income sup-
port, such as unemployed recent
graduates. Those receiving benefits
lose their council tax rebate when
sharing with others not on income
support, but the rules do not discrim-
inate between students and non-stu-
dents. Although the government
plans to rectify the anomaly in April,
this will be too late for those students
not already registered, preventing
them from voting in this general
election.
The government states that regis-
tering to vote has no connection
whatsoever with benefit assess-
ments. However, the president of the
National Union of Students, Douglas
