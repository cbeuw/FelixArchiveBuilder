Grubby Miners on strike as The Slags
heap on the humiliation
FOOTBALL
With the seconds glorious run of two
wins stopped dead in its tracks by St
Mary's on Wednesday, the signs
looked ominous for our heroes. The
opposition were the league leaders,
Royal School of Mines, who had
won nine out of ten thus far; two of
our centre-halves were out due to
exam stress; and our goalkeeper cri-
sis was still unresolved. Everything
pointed to a drubbing, but there are
no easy matches against "The Slags."
Our most pressing problem was
the lack of goalie (especially as R S M
had sportingly sent home a spare
keeper to prevent him playing for us)
and so volunteers were asked for.
With even the mighty Robo balking
at this challenge, there was only one
man brave enough to don the gloves
of destiny for what was surely to be a
siege of the IC goal. That man was
Andy - about the shortest player
there and someone who had never
played in goal. Truly this was a day
when he would have to dig deep and
show the world his mettle.
The first twenty minutes con-
firmed that this was going to be a
tough match. Our midfield was being
pulled apart by the slick passing and
movement of RSM. Solid defending
from German and captain Steve
could only stem the flow so much
and the grubby miners managed sev-
eral shots on goal. Each time,
though, with the ball whistling
through the air on an seemingly
unstoppable course for the back of
our net, from out of nowhere flew a
blur of blue to intercept and disarm
the missile. Andy was a revelation in
goal - "inspired" doesn't really do his
performance credit. With an uncanny
knack of perfect positioning and
Bostick gloves, a few extra inches in
height and he could be playing for
England.
Even with Andy's heroics, we
were hard pushed to play a construc-
tive part in the game. With the wind
against us and the playing uphill
there was a real sense that holding on
until half time would be an achieve-
ment. This was not to be, however,
as the miners broke and scored to go
in leading at half time.
The second half started and sud-
denly we looked like a different
team. R S M were still playing the ball
around well, but now so were we.
Good use of the full-backs Phil and
Loz to bring the ball out from short
goal kicks gave our play a cultured
air that even the league leaders
couldn't match. The equaliser came
from a corner. Throughout the match
the antics of the miner's 'keeper had
us wondering how bad the one that
had been sent home was, but from
this one he excelled himself - stand-
ing watching in the middle of the
goal as the ball sailed over his head
to be smashed in at the far post by the
mighty Robo.
The momentum of our play was
taken away as R S M were awarded a
very dubious penalty for one of their
players lying on the floor and kicking
the mighty Robo. The spot-kick was
duly scored, but not by the player
who placed the ball. Despite this ille-
gality the referee let the goal stand
and we were struggling again. More
cat-like heroics from Andy couldn't
stop a third goal, and it looked like it
was all over.
Luckily it seemed that we had
taken good notice of the article in the
kit bag mag about coming from
behind, and the passes started to be
strung together. The miners seemed
to be on strike as we piled forward,
every member of the IC team wanti-
ng the ball to run with at their belea-
guered defence. Felix's mid-season
renaissance continued as he skinned
the left back time and again and even
Dave looked quite good as "The
Slags" rallied for one of their gutsiest
performances to date.
In the end RSM were more pound-
ed into submission than pulled apart
by slick passing, as we were twice
quickest in a packed penalty area.
First Martin scored his obligatory
goal as their donkey of a keeper
dropped the ball at his feet, and then
Hajo managed to keep his head as all
about him defenders were losing
theirs' (German is getting more and
more aggressive) to lob the ball from
Loz's square pass.
The game ended with IC the moral
victors, despite the points being
shared.

Early celebrations (and downright
arrogance) fail to halt Fencers charge
FENCING
Imperial College Men's and
Women's First Drinking team won
again. Unfortunately, the women,
after seeing the men thrash the shit
out of Nottingham, failed to match
them for total domination of the
game. What are we talking about?
Why, fencing of course.
The Men's team consisted of our
team captain, Master of Weapons
Crazy Legs, Ray, Sebastian, Geezer,
Babyface and Animal. Fights were
dropped by Crazy Legs and Ray,
leaving the score 7-2 to IC. Next
came the foil, with wins for Crazy
Legs, Ray and Babyface. 7-2 again.
By this time the overall match was
well won, so certain members of the
team started getting a tiny bit merry
before the match was over. Which
fool decided to put a bar in a sports
centre? However, the epee was still
won in a stunning final match win by
Crazy Legs (again!).
The Women's team were Fire,
Earth and Air (the men's team got
through enough liquid to amply
make up for the absence of water).
With all three women fencing both
epee and foil, they put a good show-
ing against a very strong opposition,
to win six of their fights.
The next match for the men (who
present an excellent chance of win-
ning the B U S A team event) is
against Manchester or Bradford, and
with luck a full team will turn out as
each round will be harder - so be
their Tweedledum and Tweedledee
(the foil twins).
