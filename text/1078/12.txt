LETTERS TO FELIX

Bookstore Tender
question marks
Dear Mr Feakes,
In the Felix of 31s
' January, the
article entitled 'Waterstone's on
JANET' suggests that Waterstone's
will be using the academic network
JANET for commercial purposes via
a campus connection. During the
evaluation of the Bookstore tenders,
the Centre was asked to specify
under what conditions any of the bid-
ders could access the campus net-
work. The response was that anyone
of them could have a connection to
the campus network, but would then
have to guarantee, in writing, not to
try to access or use the JANET net-
work. These are the terms under
which, for example, STA the travel
agents are allowed to use the campus
network. If Waterstone's wish to use
the Internet for commercial purposes
from the College campus, then they
will need to obtain a commercial
connection from an Internet Service
Provider.
Yours sincerely,
RJHynds
Get a Result....
Dear Felix,
I am writing to let you and all the
students know that the Library con-
sidered very seriously how it could
alleviate the hardship to be caused by
the closure, for part of the day, dur-
ing the next two weeks. We have
also received the letter from the
Biology students and wholly sympa-
thise with them - after all, the library
staff have been exposed to noise,
dust, dirt, flooding, accidents and
inconvenience since last Summer.
We have always insisted that we
must keep the Library open, but now
the construction work demands that
we close for certain periods. We can-
not but accept this demand.
However, I can now tell you that
library staff have volunteered for
Sunday work to keep the Library
open on the 9th of February (the
Sunday before the exams) and the
16th of February (the mid Sunday of
the closure period) . We shall be
open between 9.30am and 5.30pm.
Only the basic Library Desks will be
staffed but all the reading areas will
be open. We would also like to
encourage users to make use of the
extra borrowing allowance, but ask
them to return books as soon as pos-
sible so that others might use them.
Finally, we welcome the students
raising their concern about the build-
ing work. This will help us to fight
against further disruptions. As for
disasters - we would like to avoid
them as much as you!
Yours sincerely,
Magda Czigany Director of
Library Services

"...THOSE
PESKY MEDICS"
'Medics secure independence' is a
grand headline for a stirring story of
triumph in the face of adversity. The
medical students of St Mary's and
Charing Cross medical schools have
succeeded in ring-fencing up to
£80,000 a year for the students'
union of the Imperial College
School of Medicine.
Unfortnately this is, and will be in
the future, to the detriment of
Imperial College students as a
whole. Yet again St Mary's students
have managed to force the agenda to
meet their own selfish interests and
in the process have deprived other
students of funds for their activities.
The new medical school students
union, as they envision it, will bring
much duplication of the services and
clubs provided and funded by
Imperial College Union. ICU and
the College have been neatly side-
stepped by a room full of baying
medical students and left in a much
weaker postion to face future
demands by those students.
If it was simply a case of giving
here where the College had taken
away elsewhere, then some remu-
neration for the loss of social space
in the new bio-medical science
building might be justified.
However, this possibly legitimate
allocation of funds and the negoita-
tions surrounding it have bypassed
the College's stated medium of pro-
viding student services, ICU, and
have therefore prioritised one sec-
tion of students over another.
Duplication of the services pro-
vided by ICU is unnecessary and a
waste of resources when money is
already scarce. Duplication of the
clubs and societies by the union is
again, apart from sporting clubs
such as rugby and hockey that are
already devolved to the Constituent
College Unions, a wasteful and divi-
sive use of funds. Nobody would
deny the medical student's right to
an identity, particularly one rein-
forced by sporting merit and
achcivcmcnt, but however vocal
they may be, these students must be
treated the same as other students at
Imperial College.
The new ICSMSU will be a CCU
of equal standing to the other three,
slightly smaller than C & G and the
RCS and bigger than the RSM.
These CCUs run clubs similar to
those that St Mary's and Charing
Cross currently operate with a fifth
of the subvention. Additonally, these
CCUs are funded through ICU thus
ensuring that the College's financial
regulations are followed and allow-
ing proper accounting of these funds
to be maintained within the context
of the student body as a whole.
I would question whether the
medical students really have gained
in the long run by sneakily extract-
ing this concession from College.
There is certainly a short term gain,
for both ICSMSU and the College,
but this move will only serve to help
alienate these medical students from
the rest of the College, which must
be detrimental to the substance of
this institution.
Ultimately, I can only say well
done. Well done to St Mary's for
securing their 'independence'. Well
done to the College for ensuring
future division on the campus.
OPERATIC SOCIETY
While I'm here, I feel that I ought to
mention the excellent performance
of 'Sweet Charity' by OpSoc I
enjoyed this week. I would recom-
mend it for an evening's enjoyment.
