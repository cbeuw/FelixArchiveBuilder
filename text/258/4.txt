For all the criticism levelled at NUS in this College, one can have
only respect for the way that the executive of this body has chosen to
run the grants campaign.
Using the experience gained from the ill-fated campaign against
the raising of overseas students' fees, a plan of action has been worked
out which aims to :
(1) Point out the basic contradiction in the government's policy
in halving an unknown sum to be recommended by a body, set up
by the government, to determine what will be the MINIMUM amount
students will need to live on from 1968-1971. ,
(2) Show that cots in education are detrimental to the long-term
well-being of the country for the sake of short-term administrative
expediency.
(3) Kill the " parasites on society " image of students.
(4) Demonstrate that we are willing to help out in the country's
financial difficulties by accepting the 50 per cent cut for ONE Y E A R
(not " for the time being ").
The large measure of support from the leaders of almost all
sections of the student body many of whom, like myself, ire not no'ed
as being the most ardent fans of NUS executive) is one indication '.hat
the right line is being taken. Another is that a plan is bein;» produced
which will not expand all our resources and possible means of action
at once. The campaign will probably have to keep up momentum
until at least May, when the final decision is announced, if it is to
have any effect at all.
I hope that I will be forgiven for statin? what, to most people, is
obvious, but we are not affiliated to NUS. NUS have, however, made
no attempt to stop IC from participating in the campaign sa far, in
fact, we havs been accorded the same rights as members and our par-
ticipation vtc!i amcd. I hone that the students from 'his College (yes,
that means vo« as well a
< executive and Council) will take every
opportunity to «5 e the .. if r
n their full support.
The next big event -A'.11 K 'he lobby of Parliament next Wednes-
day. We are less than ha! a hour's journey from there, the loss
of an afternoon's lab work bi » game of rugby is a small price to pay
for safeguarding the income uot only of ourselves, but of countless
students yet to enter higher education, and for keeping the oppor-
tunity of a university education open to chose from families who
could not other se afford it.
I know th.. it is difficult for peep <ot submerged in Union
affairs take part in this sort of actio: since one ine *abi, feels an
outsic I confess that I have not Jsen part in snilar actions
before ior these sort of reasons. T^is ti e must oe different. I
appeal to all IC students to supp the ohb; at .1 persuade their
parents to write to their MP. Yo ve an effect, your voice
will be heard, no one will do it for y ,

PHILLIPS'
INTEGRITY
K I N S E L L A
F E L I X
Dear Sir,
The two letters you published
last week concerning apathy did
nothing except underline the in-
ability of these writers to produce
a scathing letter and the fact that
they don't like C. J. Kent. It is
a pity that the arguments were
not presented in a more mature
fashion.
I have always been led to be-
lieve that the selection procedure
for university was quite rigorous,
especially at I.C. How, then, can
university be a microcosm of
society? Perhaps S. P. Chambers
should take a look at C. Tuxford's
copy of Cassell's Concise Oxford
Dictionary.
Is the problem of apathy as
real as we are led to believe? I
think not. The majority of stu-
dents only have time to attend a
few functions of any one type
each term, and are thereby
branded as being " apathetic " by
those who attend any given type
of function continuously through-
out the term. It is not a matter
of indifference, it is a matter of
trying to fit everything in.
There is, however, a feeling of
apathy towards the Union. This
is surely due to the feeling that
I.C. Union is just a club run by
a clique, in this case I.C. Exec.
One way to reduce this would be,
as C. J. Kent suggests, to have the
I.C. President elected. In this
way interest in the candidates
their policies and the function of
the Union would be stimulated.
It is important that the students
of I.C. feel united to their Union,
for it is only as a united body that
I.C. can express its views with the
same force as N.U.S. or R.S.A.

Dear Sir,
I personally have always been
prepared to believe that when the
President of the Union acted in
the Union or as its representative
he sincerely believed that he was
acting in the interests of the
Union as a whole. On several
occasions I have questioned his
interpretation of those interests,
but neither I nor, as far as I
know, other members of Council
have questioned his integrity.
I also believe that the same
applies to other members of
Council and other officers ol trie
Union and its various organiza-
tions : their many differences on
Union policy have always ap-
peared to me to be sincerely held:
and those differences have pro-
vided the debate which is going
on and must always go on about
the future of our Union.
It was, therefore, with con-
siderable shock that I read the
attack on (unspecified) members
of Council and (unspecified) offi-
cers of the Union launched by
President Phillips in the last issue.
In it he saw fit to accuse those
who differ with him of name-
making and egoism, and effec-
tively refused to recognize that
their ideas might jbe motivated
simply by a different interpreta-
tion of the Union's interests.
This unsubstantiated allegation
appeared next to the " Felix"
survey in which 60 per cent of
those interested said that they
were not impressed with the
Union Executive or Council. I
would hardly think that assault
by the President on the integrity
of (unspecified) members was the
best way to improve this sad situ-
ation—I personally would prefer
the method of open debate in the
Union on the Union—a debate I
have tried to encourage both on
Council and in Union meetings.
It is perhaps unfortunate that
your interview appeared two
Dear Sir,
On behalf of IC Union Members
So 150 people attended the last
Union meeting? So 150 people
are interested in the affairs of the
two-dozen or so politicians whose
names were liberally scattered
around the last Felix?
Has it not yet occurred to Felix
that a potentially powerful stu-
dent newspaper is devoting itself
to a very small minority?
1 have no wish to disparage ine
interesting and often highly enter-
taining personalities of the " poli-
ticians." (I am acquainted with
several of them), nor do I say that
the Union does not play a vital
part in the organisation of student
life. I do say that the majority of
IC is socially lively and the
very reverse of apathetic (a word
so frequently bandied around by
those who consider that anyone
who is not interested in them-
selves is living the life of a
recluse).
IC has around 80 clubs and
societies, their leaders all very
actively keen on extending the in-
terests and broadening the hori-
zons of the students of this Col-
lege. Would you know this from
reading the last Felix? No. You
would have the impression that
IC is 200 highly discontented
bureaucrats.
Union officials are necessary to
run and coordinate the student
body as a whole, when required.
weeks after Mr. Phillips' friends
who believe that the power of
Council is increasing and ought
to be diminished—opposed a con-
stitutional amendment at an I.C.
Union Meeting designed to have
the President of the Union elected
by the general student body. I
would have thought that this
amendment would have not only
given the Union as a whole the
final say in one of the most im-
portant decisions of the year, but
also made Council more respon-
sible to the Union : aims which
Mr. Phillips (and his friends?)
claim to embrace.
Your interview also appeared a
week before the President (and
his friends) opposed on Council a
motion aimed at bringing before a
Union Meeting, Council, or the
relevant Council sub-committee
all correspondence addressed to
the Union—a motion designed to
keep both the Union and Council
more informed of what was being
done in their name.
This has, so far, been a hard
year for the Union and a harder
one for Council. It has been a
year in which personalities have
inevitably intruded into debates
about issues and *here, until Mr.
Phillips chose to open the subject
in "Felix," debates about perso-
nalities have been avoided. I feel
that while the Union allows the
President, Executive and Council
to govern the Union and act in its
name—subject only to the few
quorate Union meetings which it
suits them to adequately publicise
—personality clashes will con-
tinue. I only hope that in future
ail members of the Union—ana
its officers—will recognize that
serious differences can exist on
the future of the Union, and that
only by debating these differences
honestly will progress be made.
Yours sincerely,
PETE R U H E M A N N

They are naturally interested in
their own personalities. No-one
else is.
For two years I have been pro-
minently associated with a social
club that typically represents what
IC Union means to the vast ma-
jority of students. The Union is
a vast selection of activities to
which the student can devote
every ounce of his energy if he
chooses. Through these clubs
lifelong friends are made and life-
long interests are fostered. This
is a unique opportunity that can
only be met in a highly active
College such as our own. The
only shortage is three years of
time; the field is tremendous.
Almost any activity becomes
feasible to a fresher when he
enters this College. Because the
number of truly interested people
is so large, these activities cost
far less than their counterparts
in town or factory structures.
By all means keep the front
page of Felix to affairs that are
presumed to concern every stu-
dent to an equal extent, j But
please don't devote the inner
pages to a minority of 150.
I quote : " The majority of
students are happy." Why not?
A large number of people are
quietly concerned with making
them so.
Yours faithfully,
STEPHEN J. KINSELLA

Dear Sir,
This is in the nature of an in-
formative appeal.
The United Nations Students
Association is beginning a non-
organisation called the Universi-
ties Fight for Economic Develop-
ment (UNFED). The aims of
UNFED are a bit diffuse at the
moment except the broad one of
helping in the effort of under-
developed countries to increase
their rate of development. This
has stagnated seriously over the
past few years and is causing
deep concern to everyone con-
cerned. UNFED wants to help in
finding out the reason for this
stagnation, and, possibly, in sug-
gesting ways of rectifying it. We
do not want people to say that
they are " interested " in the sub-
ject and that they want to join
the organisation, because we hope
that it will not be an organisation.
It will merely bring people with a
common aim together from all
Universities and provide a central
sieving and distributing agent for
the information.
If anyone is interested in con-
tributing something to it would he
please contact me and I will put
him (or her) in contact with
UNFED. You needn't think of
anything of cosmic significance :
everything helps, even if it is a
small project on a very limited
scale. I would also be interested
in hearing from anyone conduct-
ing research in something which
can be applied directly to any-
thing that would be of help to an
underdeveloped country; also
from anyone who can suggest a
subject worthy of research in the
College which can then be applied
to the needs of an underdeveloped
country.
Could I be more vague?

Sir,
During my three years at Im-
perial College I have been too
apathetic to attend Union meet-
ings—I only heard of the Union
last week and was surprised to
hear we had a president. Today
having read FELIX I am a wiser
orang-utang. Contrary to the
opinions of most council members
and Union addicts, I am a happy
person. During this year 1 have
felt no need for the Union and,
surprising as it may seem, I know
three people and one of them is a
friend ! We have spent the whole
day discussing this article and I
have after much deliberation de-
cided not to stand for next year's
President for the following
reasons : —
(a) Tfiare is no election.
(b) I am unphotogenic and would
not look good in FELIX.
(c) I don't think ICU has any
aims, policies or ideals—only
money.
(On second thoughts I think I
will stand).
(d) Because I do not need the
Union to bolster my ego.
(e) Because I am not a power or
glory seeker and consider my-
self a complete enough rerson
without needing a Union
office.
(f) Because the Union has become
an authority against which to
rebel and not part of my fight
against authority.
(g) It is too far to walk to the
Union.
You may ask why I am not
going to do anything, about the
Union. The truth is—I just don't
care. _
