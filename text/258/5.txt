Delving deep into the compli-
cated hand-outs from our Minis-
try of Social Security I believe I
have at last found an investment
that could appeal to at least a
few of the students here; namely
that of contribution to the
National Insurance scheme.
Most students will have par-
taken of part or even full-time
employment at some time during
their life. All such people will
have had, or certainly should
have had, a National Insurance
card. This card, the organ of the
contributory scheme, is also used
to make the payments while at
University. Students undertak-
ing full-time study need not, it is
stressed, pay towards the scheme
at all, unless they wish to do so,
but there are certain advantages
"And on the first day of that
week (referred to as last week in
the unauthorised version) the six
apostles, in the heavenly forms of
the brotherly executive, clashed
mightily with the fourteen disci-
ples, who were resurrected as the
rest of council. When the six
asked for more powers ,they were
turned on with a sound as of a
rushing wind. And they were not
allowed the keys to heaven and
hell. When ye shall sin, ye shall
be heard by the disciples, not by
the apostles alone. For the apos-
tles are unlike the disciples. They
are not typical of disciples in
these affairs.
But in some affairs, the apos-
tles were in concord with the
disciples. For when Brother Pete
Ruhemann asked the gathered
throng to note the command-
ments that rest in the ark of the
Union Blue Book, the throng said
"Nay."
And the day after the gathering,
there was a great clamouring
and the heavens opened above
the heads of the apostles in the
Beit Quadrangle and they became
exceeding wet. They and the
women that were gathered with
them at that time. For they that
disobey the commandments of
that great God. the general stu-
dent body, shall be shewn the
wrongness of their ways.
And on the day after the Pan-
cake Race, there came forty days
of abstinence. And it was ru-
moured abroad, yea, even unto
the World's End, that Ray
Phillips would give up the Presi-
dency for Lent."
It seems to me that last week's
council meeting shewed up well
some of ICU's problems. The
members of the executive often
disagree with the majority of
Council, a body which one would
hope is more representative.
Council often misses the point.
They spent too long discussing
the rewording of a working re-
port, though all present were
agreed what the sense of the
wording should be. But they
dealt well with the disciplinary
matters. It was unfortunate that
they deliberated on these matters
in camera. Council took these
decisions on behalf-of ICU—this
was a responsibility members took
on when they were elected—and
it is unfortunate that the Union
was not allowed to see how the
decisions on the punishments
were taken.
in paying, and the decision to
make is whether the sacrifice of
about £40 a year (about £30 for
women) is worth the slightly in-
creased benefits gained thereby.
Benefits
There are five main benefits to
be had from the NI scheme. These
are: Retirement pension, sick-
ness, unemployment, widows and
maternity benefit. Normally stu-
dents do not immediately benefit
from retirement pensions, or even
sickness and unemployment bene-
fits. This leaves Widows and
Maternity benefits which could,
and I can see nothing to the con-
trary, be claimed by a student still
at College. So we will deal with
these first.
The working report I men-
tioned was about Union places in
hall. Perhaps it should have
covered a wider range of allied
topics. We have good halls of
residence—good in a lot of ways.
And a lot of the complaints that
people have about them have
been put right. As an example,
the system of appeal against
punishment from a hall commit-
tee—a matter in wmich I had
some personal interest last year—
is being changed. Previously the
Court of Appeal was the Rector.
Now there is a lesser one consist-
ing of the Senior Warden, one
Mr. Stephenson of Civil Engin-
eering, the Halls representative
and one independent warden. But
still there are not certain neces-
sary protections for the culprit.
When I, with others attempted to
appeal to Stephenson last year,
we were warned that our party
in hall—described as unruly be-
cause of a trilling fire alarm—
would be investigated from top to
bottom. We had no wish to bare
the perversions of our particular
party to public inspection and we
backed down. But does the new
system change things?
And then there are the hall
committee members who almost
invariably get back into hall for
a second year. Why? Most of
them contribute a lot less to the
IC student community than a host
of club members, hop runners,
Bow Street attenders and others.
The hall committees must accept
that there is no justification for
this discrimination.
Finally, there is the question of
warden's places. The Senior
Warden has one place in each hall
and each warden has a few places
in his own hall. The distribution
of the individual warden's places
seems to be done mostly on a
basis of personal contact. There
is no reason to connect the num-
ber of gliding club members in
Beit or of Wells Society members
in Tizard with the allegiances of
the respective warden and sub-
warden. But it is/ bound to cause
speculation when certain members
of these clubs got into these halls
when they were not selected by
the hall committees. There is an
obvious and very good case for
warden's places : they are neces-
sary for medical reasons and for
cases of financial hardship. But
it might be better to give them all
to the Senior Warden who could
then distribute them in consulta-
tion with the wardens.
Widowhood
The Widows benefit can only
be claimed if the widow's hus-
band had paid 156 flat rate
weekly contributions, and also to
get the full benefit, had paid an
average of 50 a year since the
age of 18. Not many students
in this class, I fear. Whether this
lengthy trial period is to dis-
courage recently immigrated
Pakistanis from dying on us, I
don't know; maybe the Ministry
is just short of money. But to
persevere, the advantage with
paying for this benefit lies in mar-
rying, and possibly dying, within
three years from now, even after
leaving university. Your pay-
ments while at University will
then count towards the three year
minimum and if contributions
have been conscientiously paid
since your 18th birthday, your
wife would get the maximum al-
lowance. Is that worth the
money? Probably an insurance
society could give you more fa-
vourable terms.
Maternity
As for Maternity benefits, if a
woman (or her husband) has been
diligently paying the contributions
for over a year before actual con-
finement, the Ministry honours
her with a lump sum of £22. A
simple reference back to the be-
ginning of this dialogue will indi-
cate that Maternity grants too are
a loser.
But before any would-be
mother turns away there is a
maternity allowance which is paid
to those who have been in full-
time employment for at least a
Or, if one happens to be
18 years 6 months only six
tbour is required. If this
ther obscure, and it un-
doubte is, this , is how the
Ministry words it:
" Fk ite contributions cou.
towards ,ne conditions for mater-
nity allowance. Where, as is usually
the case, the allowance is claimed
before confinement, it is payable
at the full rate of £4 a week if in
the 52 weeks immediately pre-
ceeding the 13th week before the
Monday of the week in which the
confinement is expected . . ." So
it goes on.
Dole
Sickness and unemployment
benefits are only paid if about 18
months of full employment is
undergone first. The voluntary
contributions while at university
do not count towards these bene-
fits at all. If, however, an ex-
student becomes sick or unem-
ployed after leaving university
before 18 months of work are
undergone, a " special rule " al-
lows him or her to get the benefit
anyway. The Social Securicorps
" pretends " that the contributions
have been paid as long as at least
six months' work has been com-
pleted. A " special inducement"
to enter university, perhaps?
Retirement
This leaves us with the Retire-
ment Pension. To qualify for full
pension at the age of 65 (60 for
women) one must have paid con-
tributions for at least three years.
No problem there. However, to
qualify for the full flat-rate retire-
ment pension, an average of 50
contributions per year from the
age of 18 must have been paid.
Quick arithmetic will show that
a three years deficit in contribu-
tions will never normally be made
up to the correct average before
retirement age.
This point, I feel is the only
serious encouragement to pay
contribution at University; but it
is not very serious L shown by
the following considerations.
First, as well as a flat-rate pen-
sion one also receives a graduated
pension which is related to one's
previous income. The loss of a
few shillings in the flat-rate pen-
sion >ld hardly be noticed
when .. j? duated pension is
added on. Second, a ' pro-
bably more important, is ihe fact
that most university graduates
would probably not be relying too
much on their state pensions after
retiring.
Grants
If there are any other advan-
tages in the N.I. scheme, they
must be very well-disguised. Even
if these benefits are enough to
cause serious consideration to
paying while a student, £40 a year
is far too much. The Ministry of
Social Security cannot really ex-
pect the average student living
even on a full grant, to be able to
afford to spend £40 a year for
such vague benefits.
An extra item on grants would
cover the cost but a simpler
solution would be to give all stu-
dents free credits with similar
benefits and conditions to fully
employed people.
The R.S.A. policy of wages for
students would also go part of
the way towards solving the
problem. Students, then being
fully employed would have to
contribute to the N.I. scheme and
the size of the wages would have
to be taken into account, the pay-
ments being compulsory.
Back to the present system.
For anyone who wishes to find out
more about the N.I. system, you
are urged to go to your local
branch of the Ministry of Social
Security. There you will be given
the appropriate leaflets to take
away and study. Read them and
then the choice is yours. The
payment is surely a luxury, and
is it worth it?
Especially with 6 years to pay off
contributions after leaving col-
