The Parkinson
Corbyn Laws
Entropy is on the increase, or more precisely the entropy idis-
ordcr) of any closed system tends to increase. This law applies to
human as well as thermodynamic systems.
Untidiness and " disorder" are declared undesirable by many
people. The reasons for this are not obvious except of course in the
case of room-cleaners who frequently suffer from the increasing
entropy of books.
Is there anything wrong with apparent disorder ? When the
fanatical proponents of tidiness say " tidy " they do not mean well-
ordered. It is quite possible for a room, a filing system or indeed
somebody's whole life to be both tidy and in a muddle. When a
system is in the state of a tidy muddle it appears tidy—neat (e.g. all
other books and papers are arranged in nice piles perpendicular to
eich other) but is not in order—not organised—illogical—difficult for
the " controller " to find anything in it. The meanings of tidy muddle
and the converse, untidy order, are illustrated by a set of lecture notes
which if randomly jumbled up and put in a folder would be a tidy
muddle, but if they were sorted out into sets for each course, and
then the clipped-together sets were spread all over the floor, they
would be in untidv order.
As far as a person's life is con-
cerned it might be true that the
people who live in a " tidy
muddle" are those who, consider-
ing neatness above all else, place
great importance on their appear-
ance, manners, and general
facade, they are pretentious.
Clearly it is more efficient to
keep systems in untidy order than
in a tidy muddle but because so
many people are so superficial,
general social pressures dictate
tidy muddle to be the form of
local, national and international
chaos.
What about Parkinson's law ?
His original law said something
like " In any system of humans
interacting in an organisation the
work to be done is spread over
the available time." This law is
the first of what I will call the
seven laws of organisational be-
haviour and is Parkinson's Time
Law. The Space Law states "The
goods associated with any person
or group of persons tend to be-
come distributed over all avail-
able space." The Communica-
tion Law states that " In any
communication the information
tends to be spread over all the
words (bits to computers) which
are increased in number to fill the
available space" (this applies
very well to the Sunday Times
and politicians. The Decision
Law says that " Decisions are
made with the greatest possible
indecision (as many options as
possible are left open) in the
maximum possible time" (wit-
ness most Civil Service depart-
ments). Parkinson's Inertia Law
is " Human systems are implicitly
conservative, changes being made
as late as possible." (This is the
one that drives Leftists crazy.)
We have all met the Spending
Law which states " The quantity
of goods purchased is only limited
by the amount of money avail-
able." The Seventh Law sum-
marises all the others : " All
human systems tend towards
maximum inefficiency," or more
simply " Organisational Entropy
is on the increase."
Systems become more efficient
after efficiency drives (putting
things in order) when organisa-
tional entropy is removed,
whether or not this is the most
efficient way of counteracting the
Seventh Law is debatable. I
think it is more efficient than try-
ing to maintain super-order (ig-
more the irrelevant super-tidiness)
all the time ; if we accept this we
sec that the most effective sys-
tems (effective from the point of
view of doing something) are not
100 per cent efficient, that is to
say, no systems can continuously
convert ideas into reality without
wastage.
Why on earth we should con-
vert ideas into reality at the
greatest possible rate I will not
comment on except to say some-
thing (modified quote) in the true
spirit of Waste Paper :
Don't run if you can walk.
Don't walk if you can stand.
Don't stand if you can sit.
Don't sit if you can lie.
Don't lie if you can curl up.
Don't live if you can die.
PIERS CORBYN.

Bob Mackman, tried for var-
ious sins at last week's putrid
R.C.S. All-Sport Union Meeting,
was sentenced to have his trousers
removed or marry the seductive
Miss Southside (" Spooks"
Duckett in disguise). Wisely he
chose the former course, inciden-
tally a far more terrible fate than
befell the multitudes of Guilds-
men who penetrated the meeting.

But on a more serious note,
what value is there in living in
Hall? Is it just a cheap bed, or
a vital, integral part of a univer-
sity education—the answer is that
as in any other sphere, living in
Hall is not just what you make it
but to a large extent what other
people make it for you.
If you insist,, your room can
take on the lonely isolation of an
unfriendly bed-sit but with just a
little effort from either or both
you and your neighbours it may,
and often does, become the
centre of an active social life. It
is for this reason that I feel it
important that as high a propor-
tion of First year students as
possible should be in Hall, as this
is a prime method of involving
people in social activities early in
their university careers, when most
of us have a larger proportion of
time to spend in specific non-aca-
demic activities or just sitting
around drinking coffee—or hot
water in the case of one of my
First year neighbours.
Of those fortunate few who do
get into Hall as freshers, the ones
that make full use of this privilege
are often in a position by their
first summer to reapply for a
second year " in," with a fair
chance of being among the 15 per
cent of residents who are usually
re-admitted. However I feel that
it may often be a mistake to use
the lever of newly won committee
posts to effect a second consecu-
tive year in Hall because having
usefully used your first year you
have a ready-built circle of friends
through which to maintain con-
tact with the College during a
year in the wilds of—say—Clap-
ham, while still being eligible for
a second year in Hall as a Third
year or PG student when the pres-
sures on your social and academic
life are liable to be greatest.
When filling in the Hall appli-
cation (see footnote) the inevitable
question arises as to which of tiie
ever increasing number of Halls
to apply for. With one or two
general exceptions there doesn't
seem to be much in it as they all
offer similar facilities, if in vary-
ing degrees of modernity, at com-
parable prices.
Garden Hall (with its propor-
tion of double rooms), which once
used to be the province of those
who " wanted to live in a closed
community of men " as one ap-
plication form put it, is joined
this year by the new student
houses which promise to be very
good value for money at £2 10s.
for a fairly small single room or
about £3 10s. to live in larger
rooms shared by two or three
people.
Joining student houses in the
new swinging Hall scene is the
new East Side Hall, Linstead.
Structurally similar to Southside,
this will run as a cross between
Oxbridge Halls and the freer
system at present prevalent at 1C
The cost will be about £49 a term
which will include a compulsory
evening meal 5 days a week, com-
pared with the £28 termly charge
for Southside and Weeks resi-
dents; this again seems to be an
economic addition to IC's Halls.
While for those less well off the
basement of Old Beit seems the
best bet at £23 a term, if you have
aspirations as a future president
of 1CU it may be as well to get
used to the atmosphere of Weeks
where, for some obscure reason,
you will inevitably want to be
while in office.
As food for thought, I finish
with the interesting fact that for
the sufficiently ambitious a place
in Hall becomes increasingly easy
with time and probably cheaper
as well and so recommend the
following stages as the optimum
passage through College :
First Year
Get in by telling the interviewer
that you will accept place at IC
if he guarantees a first year in
Hall of Residence. Once in, get
on Hall Committee.
Second Year
Hall Committee place might
ease you in but play an active
part in some " i n " club as a
preferable bonus.
Third Year
Chairman/Secretary of A C C /
RCC/SCC : this gives automatic
place in Hall. So does Editor of
FELIX but that's hard work.
Fourth Year
Halls Rep on Council auto-
matic place in Hall. Use year to
transfer your allegiance from IC
to constituent colleges.
Fifth Year
President of constituent Col-
lege. This is hard work but fun
and half the cost of Hall place is
paid for—care must be taken in
transferring from IC Clubs Com-
mittees to Constituent Colleges.
Election platform must be sound.
Sixth Year
President of IC. All your Hall
place is paid for. Use your year
to transfer your allegiance from
students to staff.
Seventh Year, Eighth Year , . .
Get nominated Sub-warden; an
unonerous task for which you are
(Footnote: Hall application forms
may be obtained from Miss Sher-
wood on 3rd Floor of New Beit
or from Miss Burns in the South-
side office and must be returned
completed to Miss Burns by 1st
May.)
