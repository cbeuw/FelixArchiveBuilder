P A N C A K E S WITHOUT PRESIDENT
A little cheating by I.C.W.A.
Well, we finally made it. Des-
pite Martin Lack attempting to
shut off all the fire hoses and bar
all ways of access to the roofs
surrounding Beit Quad, we had
our Shrove Tuesday feast of banal
ablution to prepare us for the
abstinence of Lent. Unlike
Morphy Day and the Swimming
Gala, the Pancake race did get
off the ground and gave a few
people the chance to sling water
at each other. In spite of the ab-
sense of your hydrophobic presi-
dent, Ray Phillips, ICWA execu-
tive and prominent members of
ICU threw their pancakes with
great abandon ,and amongst cas-
cades of pure undiluted water
ICWA won by a distance.
Council
Discipline
At the Council meeting a week
last Monday three members of
the Union were suspended for
short periods.
Two gentlemen who had spent
the night in the 1CWA lounge and
were discovered early the next
morning by a security guard were
suspended for one week. The
security guard claimed that ob-
scene language was used at him
and that beer had been spilt on
the floor. The miscreants denied
these charges but admitted taking
a jug of beer into the lounge,
where they played cards and de-
cided to stay the night when it
started raining.
Another person who was seen
to throw a chair on to the stage
at the end of the Smoking Con-
cert, and was stopped by Mike
Tait, Vice-President of RCS from
throwing another, was suspended
for ten days, a second one who
admitted throwing beer but no
chairs, glasses or bottles was cau-
tioned. These two were unfor-
tunate in that they were the only
two out of a fair number of
people who were identified.
Although discussion of the
cases was in camera it is reliably
reported that some members of
Council tried to have the sen-
tences of the two who slept in
ICWA lounge postponed because
it might prejudice the chances of
IC Rugby Club (people under
suspension are not eligible to
play for IC teams or take part in
the activities of clubs).
RSM RUGBY HITS PARIS
The R.S.M. Rugby Club were
in Paris for the weekend of the
France-England International, as
guests of the Ecole des Mines de
Paris.
The short tour began in South-
side at 9.00 on the Friday morn-
ing somewhat surprisingly with
nobody late. Having boarded the
train at Victoria, except for one
or two incidents, the party of 21
Minesmen and one distinguished
member of the RCS—who for
the sake of anonymity will here-
after be referred to as Mr. Smith,
proceeded to quietly drink its wa,y
down to Newhaven, whilst playing
500.
Around 12.00, the boat sailed
from Newhaven for Dieppe, the
entire party by this time being
well established in the bar. The
French Beer was going down very
well, but not as well as the Ricard.
As the crossing lasts about four
hours, one can fully imagine that
a good time was had by all, in-
cluding the gentleman who gene-
rously, but rather stupidly, sur-
rendered his trousers into the
eager hands of Mr. Wells.
The first major incident of the
tour occurred at Dieppe when
one of our number, who shall be
nameless, struck a member of the
local gendarmerie in the region of
his lower abdomen. The claim of
self-defence was not accepted,
and our much maligned comrade
eventually rejoined us in Paris on
the Sunday afternoon.
Despite the distraction of a
rather randy Russian Ladv the re-
maining 21 arrived in Paris at
about 6.30. Our hosts met us at
St. Lazare station, and quickly
settled us in at the Maison des
Mines. At this junction, Mr.
Wells retired to bed.
Allez
The early part of the Friday
evening was occupied with a tour
of one or two of the locai1
bars.
In one particular bar, Mr. Smith's
experiments with hard-boiled eggs
amused all but the good land-
lady who somewhat bluntly asked
us to " Allez."
The latter part of the evening
was spent at a dance given in our
honour. Everyone thoroughly
enjoyed this, but none more than
Mr. Smith, whose exhibition on
the Billiard Table remains a
priceless memory. So, too, does
his rapid disappearance to bed
shortly afterwards.
About this time, the episode in-
volving " Le phantom pisseur "
is thought to have occured. Sub-
sequent investigation and recon-
struction of the episode revealed
little except that Mr. Smith, for a
change was not involved.
Rumour has it that by 3.30
on Saturday morning, everyone
was in bed.
Rugby for some
Saturday morning saw 18 very
tired Minesmen attempting to
play rugby, against an enthusias-
tic if not over talented Paris side.
For the record, in an uninspiring
game, Mr. Greetham led his side
to victory by 11 points to 9. It is
also worth noting that having
been sent off the field, after ten
minutes, by both captains, and
disowned by the spectators, Mr.
Burgess retired to the sanctuary
of some nearby bush, where he
proceeded to sulk.
In the afternoon, the inter-
national was watched. This was
far and away the least entertain-
ing part of the weekend, despite
Mr. Smith's valiant efforts.
and Gaol
Saturday evening was an event
in itself, but one weighed down
with one hilarious incident after
another, the " hard core " of the
party again being to the fore. We
were very well entertained by our
hosts, who laid on a very good
meal for us in a " downtown "
restaurant. They also supplied
a little red wine. The meal was
rounded off with a lively sing-
song, and carrot, expertly con-
trolled by Mr. Smith.
Our hosts then left us to ex-
plore Pigalle and Montmartrc. A
great night was had by all, despite
an outstanding bill for a round of
Ricard, a slightly damaged ladies
toilet door, and a game of 500
played in a gaol in Montmartre.
On this occasion Mr. V. K. and
company did not go to bed at
all.
Sunday morning saw a rather
chaotic return journey start at
9.00. Everyone was a little tired
(at least) and heartfelt thanks
must be extended to Mr. Gunnell,
who performed the near-impos-
sible task of getting everyone
safely onto the train.
To say the return journey was
uneventful would be stretchine a
point but everyone arrived safely
in London at about 7.00 Sunday
evening, to have a quiet drink in
Southside. Concratulations are
extended to Mr. V. K. who
amazed us all between Saturday
evening and Sunday Evening.
It is the considered opinion of
all members of the party that the
weekend was one of the finest, if
not the finest, ever experienced by
RSM Rugby Club on tour. Very
grateful thanks are due to our
hosts in Paris, but also to Messrs.
Greetham, Gunnell and Smith, for
all they contributed towards such
a magnificent weekend.
DAD.
Dancing
IC Dancing Club won two
trophies last Friday evening at the
inter-University Ballroom Danc-
ing Championships at Porchester
Hall, Bayswater, when U L U were
the hosts.
IC had entered three couples:
Kim Shim and Giselle Marriner
reached the semi-finals of the fox-
trot and individual rhumba,
Karen Gott and Nigel danced in
the cha-cha and Derek Southgate
and Ann Everard won both the
waltz and the individual rhumba.
Two further successes were a
bottle of wine won by an IC com-
mittee member in a raffle and the
abduction of the Manchester Uni-
versity Mascot which may be
viewed by appointment with a
committee member.

Punch up
with O S S
So OSS makes another first.
No; not just more than 50 pints
on the hot-blood scheme, but an
A G M with that added ingredient!
Bedford College Task Force and
Imperial College OSS unite for
a Punch-up. We will unravel the
secret of Sscch to produce a punch
with a punch and the Steel Band,
a snack and a film, perhaps, more
punch? With the ladies of Bed-
ford present it can be nothing but
another sweeping success on the
social scene! If you miss it, don't
blame me. I told you everythin;.
except that it is in SCR Physics
(Level 8) at 7.30, March 7th after
the A G M in Civil 207 at 6.30 and
that committee members may be
bribed into selling you a ticket.
