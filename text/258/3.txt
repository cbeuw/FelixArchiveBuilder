We regret to inform you that
Jay Ukelelee Murendel will not
be appearing at Guilds-Mines
Carnival after all. His agent tele-
phoned to say that Mr. Murendel
has just reached a state of trans-
cendental constipation and could
not be disturbed. Arthur Brown,
on the other hand, will be appear-
ing and we hope that everyone
will have a good time on Friday.
Try not to miss his first number,
" I don't want to set the world on
fire."
Carnival collections have
reached, to date, a grand total of
£1,200, and our vice-president

way ?) has vowed to increase

The next big event looming up
on the RCS calendar is the annual
dinner to be held on 2nd May.
Although that's next term, all
tickets must be obtained this
term. Guests include Lord and
Lady Beeching, Lord and Lady
Penney and Heads of Depart-
ments. Tickets can be obtained
from Year Reps so hurry, hurry!
In the more immediate future, in
fact tomorrow, there is the
Chemistry Social Dinner. This is
likely to be interesting as both
the speaker, Dorothy Hodgkin,
the .Nobel Prizewinner, and the
president, Judith Poe, are women.

term or bust. The question now
is, whose bust ? Congratulations
to Mech Eng 1 on their magnifi-
cent effort on Sunday 25th, next
time perhaps they could surround
the Albert Hall before it empties!
Guilds have once again en-
tered two very strong Pedal Car
teams for the Bristol 24-hour
race. We would like to thank all
those who have devoted a great
deal of time and effort to the race
and its preparations. Refer to
page 2 for the results.
The results of the training
undertaken by a large number of
Guildsmen at Union Meetings
may be tested at the Paper Darf
competition on March 12th.
Please look out for all relevant
posters and give it your full sup-
port. All proceeds will be used
to swell the Guilds Carnival
After an encouraging start and
an overflowing lecture theatre, at-
tendance at Management Studies
has declined somewhat. This is
surprising as the lectures are ex-
tremely interesting as well as
being easy to listen to. Perhaps
people don't realise that each
lecture is complete in itself. There
are four more lectures in the
series and they are well worth
going to for both second and third
years. You can find out how
British industry works. For those
applying for jobs at the moment
they are invaluable. Don't for-
get : Tuesdays, 4.30, 542 Mech

Now is the time to start train-

ment on March 10th. Unfortu-
nately, the application for a three-
hour extension for the Union bar
has been rejected. Coaches will
run from the Union to Harling-

support is required. In fact, if

Although RCS decided not to
join NUS last year, opinion in the
College supporting the NUS
grants campaign is strong. Presi-
dent Mackman went as official
RCS representative to the L R O
conference held at U C last week.
He personally does not support
strike or rally action but is in
favour of a parliamentary lobby.

pen to get beaten up on Chelsea

Now that election time is round
again it is pleasing to look back
and see what a tremendous jcb
has been done this year by the
committees of the various clubs
and societies within Mines.
The more academically biased
societies have had a particularly
successful year. Mining and Met.
Soc. have had an impressive pro-
gramme of speakers from
throughout industry and their big
event of the year is Min. and Met.
Day on 14th Marcn The De la
Beche Club too have had a very
successful year despite the fact
that the foot and mouth disease
epidemic has restricted their ac-
tivities in the field. Last week the
annual De La Beche Club Sym-
posium was held in the Union and
the topic of " Fract ig in Geo-
logical Materials " tv /ed a great
succe s. The smaiiu Petroleum
Society is also flourishing and the
full pr ammo culminated three
weeks a1

a fine svm^osium
on " Aspects of C p donate
Bodies."
In the sportine field the Soccer
Club did not quite manage to win
the Technology Cup but Captain
Dick Adams is confident that his
team will once again thrash Cam-
borne. Under Stan Greetham the
Rugby Club is still coing strong
and after an alcoholic week-end
in Paris, which included a win
over Ecole de Mines Stan informs
us that the team will have re-
covered in time to once again win
the Sparkes Cup, Engineers Cup
and the Bottle.

On luesday Mr. Anthony
Durham, a Research Chemist
from Cambridge and Birmingham
Universities spoke to the H . G.
Wells (or S. G. Wells after one of
its founder members) Society and
suggested mundane reasons to ex-
plain the phenomena of Unidenti-
fied Flying Objects.
Calling his talk " From the
Sublime to the Ridiculous," he
began by outlining some of the
interest that can be achieved in
verifying reports of phenomena.
90 per cent of reports can be dis-
missed because they are either
easily explained or because they
v\ ere so badly observed as to ren-
der them useless. He quoted one
such report, which members
found difficult to believe was writ-
ten seriously, though he assured
his audience that it was genuine.
He explained that many reports
can easily be shown to be astro-
nomical, often due to Venus or
the Moon. Failing this explana-
tion he suggested that more rare
occurrences were due to meteors,
aurora or even clouds. A fair
number of reports can be ac-
counted for by man-made objects,
such as aircraft, balloons, heli-
copters and such rare but fasci-
nating effects as aircraft flying
without lights in order to bring in
contraband goods.
Particularly interesting were his
accounts of phenomena caused by
atmospheric effects like ice crys-
tals in the air scattering sunlight.
This can produce memorable illu-
sions particularly just before or
just after sunset when the phe-
nomena due to the sun could be
observed but the sun itself could
not.
Mr. Durham described his spe-
ciality on this subject, the investi-
gation of effects due to lightning
or tornados and during the lecture
showed some interesting slides
that could have convinced one
that UFO's really existed, but he
gave a plausible explanation for
each.
Perhaps the only conclusions
that can be drawn from his dis-
cussion is that what we think
contains green men from Venus
may well do so—being the planet
itself.
Find out first-hand what life is like as a
Patent Examiner*
You would be surprised to learn
how interesting a career as a Patent
Examiner can be. Accept this invitation
to visit us at the Patent Office and
find out all about it first-hand.
Basically the job of the Patent
Examiner is to vet applications for the
patenting of new ideas in electrical,
mechanical, chemical and other fields.
When you join you are assigned to
a senior Examiner who will start you
off on the less complicated
specifications, to give you the chance
to grasp the mechanics of the task.
As your aptitude develops so you will
be given more and more demanding
work and with less and less
supervision, until eventually you work
entirely on your own.
Make no mistake about it, to meet
the challenge which this kind of work
involves, you need an enquiring mind
and the ability to develop your critical
and analytical faculties to the highest
degree. And you have to be prepared to
argue your case with the applicant or
his professional advisers.
You will earn an excellent salary,
starting at £1,051 and reaching £1,756
after 3-5 years. Virtually all examiners
reach senior grade, salary up to £3,625.
This can be reached after 8-10 years.
Holidays are significantly better than
you could expect in industry.
Non-contributory pension.
Now you have an outline idea of
the job. If you would like to find out
more, please write to Mr. C. L. El. Smith,
The Patent Office, 25 Southampton
Buildings, London, W.C.2. He will send
you full details, and you can then
arrange a day to visit the Patent Office.
*N.B. To be eligible you must have, or expect
to obtain, a First or Second Class Honours
degree in engineering, physics, chemistry,
or mathematics with physics or technology,
or an equivalent qualification.
