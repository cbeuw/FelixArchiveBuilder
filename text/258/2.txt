Bristol Pedal Car Race
RCS WIN THEIR
CLASS AGAIN
Speed down the home straight
For the third year running RCS in " Jezette " have won their
class in the 24-hour Bristol Pedal Car Race
Staged as part of the Bristol University Rag Week the race was
won outright by Bristol University Engineering Society and the handi-
cap (the number of laps of the course, Whitchurch airfield near
Bristol, divided by the wheel circumference) is believed to have been
won by QMC. RCS won Class 1, for cars with under 14 inch dia-
meter wheels. The two Guilds cars, both in Class 2 for up to 20 inch
wheels, broke down, one with a broken crankshaft, and the other with
a collapsed frame. After repair, the latter completed the course and
finished about 12th. Guilds were also robbed last year because of
mechanical failure of their cars.

QUIET COUNCIL
MEETING
The meeting of Council a week
last Monday was a quiet affair,
certainly by the standards of the
previous one. Nevertheless, due
mainly to arguments over such
trivia as whether part of the
wording of the new policy on
Union places in Hall should
read " The editor or assistant edi-
tor of FELIX " or "The editor
or failing him the assistant editor
of FELIX " or " The editor or if
he is ineligible the assistant editor
of FELIX " or " The editor or in
the event of his not accepting a
place the assistant editor of
FELIX," the possibilities are
limitless. Everyone knew what
they wanted to mean, but they
spent at least five minutes expres-
sins such a simple idea.
The President disclosed in-
formation on the Appeals Board
for the Halls (see separate story),
that the Secretary of the College
had compiled a report for the
Rector on careers advice and that
the Registrar had written to firms
taking vacation trainees to try to
improve their waees.
New Boards
A Union Publications Board
was set up, amalgamating the
present Felix and Phoenix Boards
and taking in the Union Hand-
book. Any other Union publica-
tions which may be produced will
come under this Board as well.
A constitution for the Carnival
Board, formalising the present
set-up and admitting the Chair-
man of Ents was accepted.
A new policy on Union Places
in Hall, which recommends an
increase of five more Union
places: for the External Affairs
and Welfare Officers and the con-
stituent college Vice-Presidents,
was approved and will now be
presented to the Halls of Residence
Committee for acceptance. None
of these places will be in Student
Houses, since it was felt that the
reason for havine Union places
was that the people should be ac-
cessible.
J U D C O
An examination of the College
Charter by the Rector and a
working paper written by the
Rector recommending the setting
up of JUDCO—the Joint Union
and Deans Committee—consist-
ing of Council plus the Deans of
the three Colleges, the Rector,
Pro-Rector and Secretary of the
College, were studied. A pilot
meeting of JUDCO is being ar-
ranged.
Mr. Ruhemann, in a letter,
brought up the plight of overseas
students who are able to register
for College awards and not for
University degrees, because they
only deal with the College when
applying and College and Univer-
sity regulations are sometimes
different. The College is to be
asked to provide information
about University regulations as
well as the College information.
Bob Fryer, the Halls of Resi-
dence rep had his jurisdiction ex-
tended to cover the residents of
student houses until they can
justify their own representative.
Exec uti ve
Powers
Pete Ruhemann tabled a mo-
tion noting that the powers of the
executive in the Union bye-laws
are limited to domestic and ur-
gent matters which, incredibly,
was defeated. Afterwards no
one seemed sure of exactly what
they had voted on, Keith Guy
claiming that the executive were
now not able to act on any
matters.
Barbara Hedge, the External
Affairs Officer, was instructed to
organise IC participation in the
Trafalgar Square rally, a motion
that discipline should be en-
trusted to the executive was voted
for by the executive and Rog
Chappell and defeated and the
meeting closed after 3| hours of
truly breathtaking inconsequence
with a suggestion that Council
IC MEN
BEATEN UP
In a so-called " civilised " city
such as London it is surprising
that people are attacked and
beaten up for no apparent reason.
A week last Friday Bob Mack-
man, RCSU President, Rob
Collinpe, a hopeful candidate for
Council, and two others slopped
on Chelsea Bridge for a hot dog
on their way back to College from
a party. After Rob Colhnge had
bought his hot dog he vanished
behind the stand and when Mack-
man followed him a few moments
later. Collinge was being attacked
bv about eight men, aged around
30, who were trying to throw him
into the river. Mackman man-
fully strode un to this scuffle and
began to explain that such deal-
ings were not really in the rules of
cricket. For his efforts he was
punchedfivetimes in the face and
rendered unconscious. Collinge
seems to have passed out after re-
ceiving a few punches and kicks
to the face, and would have been
thrown in the river if the men had
not returned to their senses. The
other two in the students' party
split their efforts—one joined the
fight, the other, more sensibly,
ran to 'phone the police.
The, three warriors were taken
to hospital where Mackman and
Collinge were detained for two
nights. Their recovery seems to
have been speeded by a lady doc-
tor whom Mackman claims he
tried to chat-up. The standard of
nurses at St. Stephen's Hospital is
not supposed to be very high, but
as to their nursing ability there
can be no doubt for Mackman
and Collinge recovered at such a
rate that they weren't discharged
from hospital, but "chucked out *
in time for Monday lectures.
might meet on a Sunday after-
noon, defeated because Stew
Barnes would be seeing his girl
friend and ICWA were making
decorations for their Formal.
The next meeting will be 5.45
p.m. on Monday, March 18th, in
the reading room of the Union
when once again FELIX will
bring you exclusive coverage of
this mammoth spectacle.
LRO LAUNCHES
CAMPAIGN
" I'm sure my sums are right,
I can't do mental arithmetic in
my head," said Patrick Gordon
Walker, Minister for Education,
in a recent Commons debate on
the impending cuts in education
finance. So claimed Graham
Searle of King's, challenging the
competence of the Government
when he chaired a meeting on the
Student Grants Campaign at the
Institute of Education on Friday
23rd. In harness with last Sun-
day's Trafalgar Square Rally, this
meeting was the launching pad of
the Grants Campaign in London.
23 pc increase
The London Regional Organi-
sation of NUS, of which Searle is
Chairman, called the meeting
which heard representatives from
NUS, LRO, the Association of
Teachers in Technical Institutes
and the Liberal Party support the
campaign and hammer the Educa-
tion Ministry for the dictatorial
attitude they were taking in pro-
posing grant cuts.
After reviewing the position
that whatever increases the inde-
pendent advisory committee rec-
ommends, the Government will
slash these by half, Searle was at
pains to stress that the campaign
was primarily an unselfish one
because the NUS were only ask-
ing for a 23 per cent increase to
restore the 1961 purchasing power
of the grant. The crunch will
come for students following us,
as the next review is not until
1971, when rising costs will have
devalued the grant even further.
Eric Robinson, of the ATTI,
said his personal view was that
this government would go down
in education history as conser-
vative and backward, not realis-
ing that in a time when we were
economically deprived of basic
resources we would have to de-
pend on the skill and resources
of our people. In this context,
students become very important
people. He also stated that to
win the campaign, students would
have to make coherent and ex-
plicit statements of their case and
of its consequences, not merely
rely on rabble rousing and he was
glad that NUS seemed to be
adopting this line.
NUS Position
Geoff Martin, president of
NUS. following Mr. Robinson,
said little that hadn't been said
before, but appeared to convince
most of those present that NUS
wasnt the inefficient, bumbling
organization that it had some-
times appeared to be. He men-
tioned we should be ingenious in
pointing out ways the government
can make savings within the pre-
sent system, such as abolishing
the £50 minimum grant which
would result in a saving of nearly
£500,000.
Christopher Greene, from the
Liberals, the only party speaker
at a meeting which advertised
speakers from all parties, thought
that it was a pity the issue had
now become a political one, but
now that it was it should be
fought to the finish.
SLL slam NUS
Comments from thefloorcame
from members of the very vocal
Socialist Labour League, who evi-
dently believed Geoff Martin was
leading a sell-out to the govern-
ment. They were sure that the
campaign would fail unless the
left wing MPs were " made to
stand up and fight Wilson."
Whether or not the S.L.L. fore-
cast of the result turns out to be
correct, they gained a certain
amount of qualified support from
Gerry Johnson, president of UC,
who thought the NUS approach
was laughable in its timidity.
Another floor speaker was
Digby Jacks of RSA who men-
tioned the possibility of raising the
means test starting limit from
£700 to £1100 p.a. and applying
a bigger squeeze on the richer
parent. In answer to this Martin
said that they had already put
before the Minister a scheme
which would do this, cost parents
whose income was £4,500 a year
only an extra £16 per year and
save the country £1 million a
year.
