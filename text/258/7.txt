U S Universities —
Chemical
Warfare
A public meeting on " Joint
Action for Peace " was held at
Caxton Hall on Thursday as a
supplement to a conference held
last week on chemical and bio-
logical warfare. The speakers
were Dr. Victor Sidel, a physician
from Boston, Mass. (representing
the " Physicians for Social Re-
sponsibility), speaking on chem-
ical and biological weapons; Dr.
Stephen Rose of our biochemistry
department, on the use of these
weapons in Vietnam; Miss Elea-
nor Langer, a U S . journalist, on
defence research in the U.S.;
Prof. Eric Burrocks, Professor of
Physics, University College, Lon-
don, on the social function of
science; and Dr. J. H . Humphrey
on the peace movement.
Most of what was said has been
heard in IC this term; Dr. Stephen
Rose talking earlier to the IRC
and Dr. Humphrey to Wells Soc;
but new information was brought
to light.
Demonstrations
Miss Langer narrated the re-
cent incident at the University of
Pennsylvania when a student acci-
dentally discovered that the Uni-'
versity was conducting classified'
research on delivery systems of
chemical and biological weapons.
The result of this was mass de-
monstrations by students which
then rapidly spread to other uni-
ve'sities and exposed the vast net-
work of classified defence con-
tracts in many universities—
Michigan, Cornell, etc. At Penn.
University itself the faculty di-
vided into three broad groups :
(i) A minority which wanted to
get rid of all defence contracts on
the grounds that it was misuse or
abuse of science; (ii) a majority
which said that defence contracts
should not be accepted by the
university purely because they
were classified; and (iii) the rest
most of whom were engineers,
were in favour of keeping the con-
tracts because of the financial
gains they accrued. (Later the
President revealed that in fact the
university was losing $^m. on
these contracts per year.)
As a result of the students'
agitation and the support of some
of the staff, most contracts relat-
ing to chemical and biological
warfare at that university are
likely to be terminated shortly.
Miss Langer had described this
incident in detail to show how stu-
dent demonstration had brought
attention to a wide problem, and
how it was a great help to the
peace movement in the US.
Although it seems generally ac-
cepted that no classified defence
research is carried out in univer-
sities in this country, Mr. Wedge-
wood-Benn, the Minister of Tech-
nology, replying to pressing
questions in Parliament recently,
revealed that the Ministry of
Technology is spending £900,000
on 525 " aerospace" research
agreements with 51 universities
and CATs. The contracts cover
every field of basic research, from
chemistry to cybernetics and some
could have both defence and civil
applications: 37 contracts for
pure research for defence pur-
poses placed last year were classi-
fied. Mr. Benn said that it was
not in the public interest to reveal
the number of university staff 'ind
research workers subject to se-
curity clearance. The Minister
also said that for the last 5 years
the U.S. department of defence
has been paying £395,000 p.a. to
27 British universities for re-
search : all for unclassified pure
research. British exports to the
U.S. of defoliants and herbicidais
have quadrupled in the last 5
years and are now at the level of
£2m. per year.
Just Cause?
Prof. Eric Burrock propounded
the controversial view that he
believed scientists were right in
developing weapons if the cause
they were fighting for was iust
He gave the example of the belief
widely held that the allied scien-
tists were right in developing the
atom bomb in World War TI for
the cause was "obviously just."
He even said that he thought that
if North Vietnamese scientists
were developing weapons they
were right in doing so because
they were fighting for a just cause
while American scientists should
not be doing this because they
were helping an unjust cause.
While I believe that the Ameri-
cans should not be in Vietnam
and that the North Vietnamese
are largely fighting a just war, I
fail to see the logic in Prof. Bur-
rock's argument. It seems to me
obvious that scientists should not
be helping in developing anything
for destructive purposes.
Anyway, let us hope that IC is
not aiding this country's (or any
other's) " defence " effort in any
way except in supplying scientists
to the U.K.A.E.A. and to Porton
Down.

H ITS OUT
A week last Monday evening, the Socialist Society met to consider
Union affairs. A report by their Union Affairs Study Croup was
accepted without opposition. This is printed, with a few omissions,
due to lack of space, below.
General Dissatisfaction
When there is general dissatisfaction with a Collepe Union which
persists over a number of years it indicates that something is organi-
cally wrong. So it is with ICU. It is the structure that needs reform-
ing. The time has come when our interest in palace revolutions and
coups which have produced the last two presidents, and numbers of
other leading Union Officers acquires another dimension. The very
structure of the Union enables the top people to gain power by dis-
couraging the active participation of tiie average Union members and
refusing to educate or inform him ol essential matters concerning
him.
The executive as at present formed is undemocratic without
parallel. Those few Unions where the President was elected by Magic
Circle have now changed to more democratic procedures. Of the
members of 1CU executive only the Deputy President can pretend to
have any mandate from ICU and it can be said no executive member
acts as if he need have a mandate from 1CU. The present incum-
bent of the highest post our Union affords was elected without ques-
tions being put to him, or even a proposal speech being made for
him . The election of the Secretary is a similar charade.
The three constituent college presidents also sit on Exec. This
is a hangover from a bygone age which unfortunately still lingers on.
At the present time two of these three persons were elected in the
traditional manner—because they were good chaps and could hold
their beer. The third was elected on a purely constituuent college
platform and rarely mentioned ICU, if at all, during his election.
On council only 6 ordinary
members are elected democrati-
cally. 3 represent notorious sec-
tional interests and 3 the old
boys' association ! Another 4
are involved largely with finance
and do a useful job in this respect
but in little other.
ICU general meetings are
notoriously inquorate. The num-
bers constantly amaze, and em-
barrass an Exec blatant in its con-
tempt of UGM's. They fail to
call UGM's to decide important
issues, attempt to cover up im-
portant information, mislead,
gerrymander and generally at-
tempt to pass the whole affair off
as a joke. Mrs. Robb should pre-
sent each new President with a
copy of " Citrine" and a state-
ment from the college solicitors
explaining what the abuse of
Union bye-laws entails. Still,
ICU Exec has one final weapon.
No other comparable Union has
such a high percentage quorum,
no other Union would regard
having the quorum the limit of
the seating capacity of the Hall In
which the meeting is held as any-
thing but a joke. Unless the
quorum is lowered, and lowered
substantially, the Union will con-
tinue to be run by a few in their
insular ways.
It must be specifically stated
that the Union General Meeting
is supreme and the number of
UGMs per year should be in-
creased to a minimum of five.
Blame for Crisis
The old executive set-up must
be given the lion's share of the
blame for the present crisis. The
three constituent college Presi-
dents can be replaced by three
new Vice-Presidents, on the lines
of the vast majority of other Stu-
dents' Unions, who will h«ad
their own democratically elected
committees. The new vice-presi-
dents would be Internal Affairs
V.P. (doing the growing internal
organisation work now managed
by the Deputy President), Exter-
nal Affairs V P . (iieading an
External Affairs Committee of
greatly increased usefulness) and
a Welfare V.P. (working for
better student welfare). It will be
up to the ladies of the college if
they should wish to be repre-
sented by a Lady V.P., but we
must all recognise that the day
when ICWA was needed to
help the girls of the college to
settle down is so far passed that
ICWA tends nowadays to hinder
this process. It should be remem-
bercJ that this Executive of 5 or
C
) will, like the theory of the pre-
sent Exec, be only a sub-coin-
mittcc of Council and safeguards
must be built up to ensure this.
The reform of Council is
equally urgent and can take cither
of two paths : (a) we can call for
a Council of similar size to our
present Council but require it to
be elected and to act more demo-
cratically ; (b) we can call for a
radical change in the nature of
Council and ask for a Council
representing most facets of Union
life and larger than committee
size. Many Unions have chosen
the latter alternative and we
would suggest a Council compris-
ing :
(1) The Executive (5 or 6 to be
elected by referendum of the
whole college);
(2) The thirteen department reps,
(to to be mandated regularly
by their departments);
(3) 'lhe Executives ol the Clubs
Committees (the big spenders
—about 20 persons in all);
(4) Reps, of important sectional
interests, e.g. Halls, Overseas
Students, Sjlwoot!, treasurer
and three constituent college
presidents (if cotiiiiiqcnt col-
leges arc thought to be worth
preserving).
These then arc the recommen-
dations of the Study Group :
(1) The pierent undemocratic na-
ture of ICU be exposed and
attacked
(2) Union members be encour-
aged to participate in. and al-
lowed to run. their Union ;
(3) Executive and Council to be
radically reconstructed as de-
tailed above;
(4) 1CU to join NUS as a fir*t
step to aiding lhe welfare of
IC students and students as a
whole ;
(5) Th* quorum for ICUGMs to
be lowered :
(6) At least 5 UGM's to be held
every year;
(7) Ultimate authority to be
vested in UGMs;
(6) At least 5 UGMs to be held
every year;
(7) Ultimate authority to be
vested in UGMs;
(8) All elections to Executive to
be by referendum of the
whole college;
(9) ICU constitution to be altered
so as to bring these changes
about.
It is only by fundamental
changes of this nature can we ac-
quire a useful Union we can be
proud of instead of a petty in-
crowd we try to pretend does not
exist.
