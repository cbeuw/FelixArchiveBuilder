Cubby away with the Fox

hen you’re a new
establishment is-
suing a challenge
to been-around-
the-block GBK by
proclaiming you’ve got better burgers
than they do – and oﬀering punters
the chance to play bartender with the
ﬁrst self-serve beer wall in the UK –
you’re sure to set a few tongues wag-
ging. Tucked away from busy Fulham
Broadway, where the quaint cobbled
Vanston Place meets quiet Farm Lane,
relative newcomer he Lazy Fox has
done just that.
Initially I was slightly concerned
that the oft-lauded beer wall was only
a gimmicky way of drawing the punt-
ers – after stepping inside with my
boyfriend, that certainly wasn’t the
case. Upon setting up a tab card and
getting a pint-pulling demo from the
lovely Jonathan, it actually presented
itself as an ingenious benchmark for
pubs to follow: PYOP (pour your
own pint) means that even on a busy
night, you won’t be experiencing the
infamous Imperial FiveSixEight-esque
queues waiting for a pint. Or less than
a pint, even – the clever wall (of which
I’m trying hard not to insert refer-
ences to a well-known kids’ song about
green bottles every time I think about
it) allows you to pour in increments
of 1/10th of a pint, with prices being
displayed as you pour and adjusted de-
pending on amounts.
his ﬂexibility is perfect for the
nitpicky to keep tabs (hah!) on their
consumption, or for the curious ones

wanting to sample the whole mix of
beers on oﬀer. Don’t expect Magners
or Stella, as there’s an eclectic inter-
national selection of eight drinks:
from the Oktoberfest-favourite
Warsteiner, to possibly my new fa-
voUuite – craft brewer Meantime’s
oﬀering of London Pale Ale. Popular
customersuggestionssometimesap-
pear as featured drinks on the wall,
and while prices may be a bit higher
compared to established favour-
ite he White Horse further west
(which we previously reviewed), I’m
certainly not complaining with the
added control you get over your tip-
ple here. Of course, if you’re not a
craft beer person, you’re more than
welcome to have a good ol’ pint of
Guinness or some other classics
from the friendly barman.
It’s nice to see that in spite of all
the modern bells and whistles, he
Lazy Fox still has a cosy charm
about it. he interior is clean and
simple, with wooden accents,
comfy couches and real ﬁreplaces
in the bar – all of which keep it
from feeling spartan and give the
place an intimate vibe, even on a
quieter evening. he dining area
at the back is roomy, easily seating
a good amount of diners without
feeling cramped. And of course,
the Fox has two decent-sized
screens with satellite TV for those
all-important game days – other
than in your own home, this is one
of the few opportunities you’ll get
to watch satellite TV in “front-of-
the-hearth” com-
fort.
But of course,
we couldn’t leave
the place without
investigating their
bold GBK-chal-
lenging claims.
True to its aim,
the core menu is
mostly populated
with, well, burg-
ers (£9-12), while
also being ﬂanked
by a selection of
typical pub grub
(like seafood lin-
guine/sausage and
mash) and daily
specials, all per-
fectly tailored to
the season. On
Sundays, there’s a
separate roast din-
ner menu where
the meat selection
diﬀers each week,
and appears to be
one of their more
hectic days. Even
though we didn’t
have wine, I have
it on good author-
ity that the selec-
tion is perfectly
matched to the
menu whilst not
costing the Earth.
Our pan-fried
halloumi salad
starter (one of said specials) was sea-
soned and dressed just right. I shared
it with my boyfriend, who isn’t the big-
gest fan of veggies but absolutely loved
it – in hindsight, maybe I should’ve
had one to myself!
Ever the carnivore, my boyfriend,
plumped for their popular Redneck
Burger (£11.95): an 8oz ﬁllet ribeye
mix and barbecue pulled pork combi-
nation served with chips on the side.
Presented on a rustic wooden chop-
ping board, the size was absolutely
unreal. We reckoned that if our bub-
bly Greek waitress Yanna was raving
about this burger despite not being a
burger fan, we couldn’t go wrong – and
was she right. Fox one, GBK nil.
My Fritto Mistro di Mare, another
daily special, single-handedly righted
all that was wrong in this world with
greasy overcooked seafood. he bat-
ter was light and crisp, the squid and
prawns were cooked just right, and the
ﬁsh ﬁllets were so beautifully ﬂaky that
they put a Labour politician’s prom-
ises to shame. Like the Redneck, this
came with chips and salad on the side
and was just as hearty. We noticed
one couple opted to settle the bill at
this point in the meal – prior to that
we heard them commenting on how
full they were getting even after two
courses, so it wasn’t just us!
Desserts (£6 each) were a mixed bag,
as their Apple Crumble could’ve used
a bit more time to crisp up the top-
ping; but their Sticky Toﬀee Pudding
served with ice cream was divine. he
nice thing was that we were comfort-
