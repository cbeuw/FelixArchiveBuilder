FRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY

Imperial has talent
10 acts, 3 judges, 1 night and a whole
lot of fun! his year’s Imperial’s Got
Talent has proved to be bigger and
better than ever before and has raised
over £1700 for IC Save the Children.
Our ﬁnalists gave us an amazing show
with joint third place going to Jessica
Haddon and Esther Berry represent-
ing Pole Dancing Society and Kasia
Pietrzykowska’s Hula Hoop act. In
second place we had Wellington Tsu
performing a body-popping dance
and the winner of Imperial’s Got Tal-
ent 2013 was... Vidish Athavale doing a
Michael Jackson mash-up dance! he
judges had many things to say about
each performance with the RAG Pres-
ident David Goldsmith commenting
that he loved the Belly Dancing act,
Union President Paul Beaumont say-
ing he was ‘moved’ by the Piano act
and our Save the Children President
Yang Liu left speechless after the UK
national yo-yo champion performed.
With a guest appearance from Camer-
on Jay, who has performed with Emi-
lie Sande, a mega raﬄe draw and crazy
after-party, we can happily say that
this year’s Imperial’s Got Talent was
the best ever! A massive thank you to
everyone who came down and to the
performers who helped us raise such
a substantial amount of money for the
charity. We hope to see you all there
next year!
