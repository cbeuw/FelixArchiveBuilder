NSS - great response so far!
See what your Sabbs are up to on their blogs
Final years are currently smashing last year’s participation rate when you compare us to this time last year. Each subject needs at
least a 50% participation rate for the results to be published but we should be aiming for 75% across the College to make sure the
results are fully representative. This is possible, as we got 71% last year.
Also remember to not be neutral when filling it in, commit to a view.
Elections time is almost upon us! You may have seen over the last few weeks our
Sabbatical team taking a retrospective look back at their manifesto pledges that helped
them get elected. Of course, it is hard to plan an entire year of a new job before you
have even started and your Sabbaticals end up acheiveing considerably more than
what was on their manifesto.
The Sabbatical Blogs give you a chance to see what your Sabbaticals are doing day-
to-day to help improve the student experience at College. Some of the recent posts
include Paul’s trip to India with the Rector, Stefan’s Summer Ball working group,
Becky’s latest initiative to encourgae you all to start up campaigns you care about and
the great news that Henry has worked with the IC Trust to secure an increase in Club,
Society and Project tours funding by £3,000.
