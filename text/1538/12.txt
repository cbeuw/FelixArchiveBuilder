Think about the C word
Student Volunteering Week – 10 - 16 February
onday 4th Febru-
ary is National
Cancer Aware-
ness Day and the
ten-month-and-
twenty-seven day anniversary of my
father’s death from – I need hardly say
it – cancer.
According to Cancer Research UK,
roughly 325,000 people were diag-
nosed with some form of ‘malignant
neoplasm’ in 2010. But how helpful is
that statistic, or indeed any other ﬁg-
ure related to cancer? he sheer inci-
dence of the disease implies that it is
both predictable and prosaic. Cancer
is neither of those things.
First as to the predictability. Can-
cer shares all psychotic irrationality
of tyranny. It cats people about. Ini-
tially it works with stealth, frequently
announcing itself with a malevolent
ﬂourish in the young and seemingly
ﬁt, consigning them to a hamster
wheel of radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
surgery, yet more radiotherapy, anoth-
er form of surgery... Sometimes treat-
ment will manage to block the wheel,
and suﬀerers will be taunted with
daydreams of remission, which might
last for months, years, even a lifetime.
Student Volunteering Week, brought
to you by the NUS and your very own
Imperial Hub is a week aimed at cel-
ebrating, inspiring and supporting
student volunteering.
Sunday 10th
If you’ve been waiting for the right
time to get involved with Soup Run…

gest Soup Run Imperial’s Soup Run
society has ever done.
Monday 11th
Flash mob of kindness! Keep an eye
open for extremely lovely and happy
people making kind and generous ges-
tures throughout the day… there will

will be free hugs and more.
Tuesday 12th
Pancake day!! here will be lots of de-
licious pancake-oriented volunteering
opportunities – pancake party for el-
derly people in Kensington Olympia,
Kate Pumphrey wants you to remember cancer awareness day
All too often this is proven an illusion,
with cancer careering back into the
picture bearing a ﬁstful of aces.
And there is nothing mundane
about this disease, despite its preva-
lence. Chemotherapy – still one of
medicine’s most commonly deployed
solutions – is chemical warfare at its
most vicious. Extreme exhaustion,
weakness, consistent nausea, depres-
sion, profound constipation – these
are the inevitable results of treat-
ment; many also lose their hair or suf-
fer other random un-pleasantries (in
my father’s case a raw sensitization
of the nerves on his ﬁngertips, which
–extraordinary – was only eased by a
German cream made for cow udders).
And, because chemotherapy is deliv-
ered in cyclical bouts – usually every
three weeks or so – just as soon as the
patient has recovered from the worst,
they have to return for more. It’s hard
to believe that this is the remedy – the
friend, not the foe.
he impact of cancer in a family is
felt at every level. Walk into our home
a year ago and you may well have
thought you had entered a pop-up
pharmacy. Anti-emetics, anti-depres-
sants, proleukin, prolacta, carbopl-
atin, temazepam (Scrabble is now a
breeze), sleeping pills by the bedfull…
Painkiller? Do you seek Astral or
Volterol or an alphabetic intermedi-
ary? Low immune system? Take a ta-
blespoon of Manuka honey (sourced
from some obscure bee colony in one
of the remoter spots of the Far East,
then retailed at obscene expense in
central London). And the strang-
est associations are made: I look at a
Magnum ice cream, and think not of
summer and sunshine but of its ben-
eﬁts to a skeletally thin man lacking
saliva glands.
You might expect the horror of the
situation to make life very dramatic,
but mostly the path of the long-term
sick is one of dull ﬂatness. It’s tedious,
unremitting and inﬁnitely wearing.
here are frenzied lurches – the scan
results, say, or the epileptic ﬁt caused
by the drugs – but even those tend to
be smothered in the wishiwashiness of
a hospital’s grey-blueness.
If it’s hard to be gracious there are,
nevertheless, those that are grace-
ful. In my case, some of the winners
emerged from the most surprising
quarters, like the corporate law ﬁrm
(my then-employer), that more or
less let me work part-time while I was
nursing dad at the end of his life, and
the GP, who dared to speak of “inﬁnite
love, inﬁnite benevolence”. Above all,
however, it was my friends that res-
cued me from despair. Calls, cards,
messages, ﬂowers, cakes, invitations
to parties, pubs and clubs… How good
people are at being friends! How much
it matters.
Be aware on Monday. Check for
lumps, bumps, and moles; pay atten-
tion to any other strange changes in
your body. Maybe send a message to
someone you know for whom the C-
word is personal. And don’t let us ac-
cept cancer: it is unacceptable.
