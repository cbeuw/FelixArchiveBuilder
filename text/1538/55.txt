They came, sword and conquered
The guys started on Saturday, fac-
ing Bristol. Their opponents had
lost one of their main fencers, but
gained an international who held his
ground well in foil and epee. Whilst
the epeeists found the going tough,
losing their match 32-45, the foil-
ists were able to even out the score
through a 45-35 victory and then
handing it over to the sabreurs to
comfortably win 45-13 for an overall
victory of 122-93.
Next up they had Cambridge, an
opponent which had always been
strong but where Imperial had al-
ways been able to rely on the sabre
team saving the day. However, this
time they were reminded that no
success should be taken for granted
and nothing lasts forever: sabre still
won their match but by a margin
much smaller than previously since
Cambridge had now gained some
new faces that were able to put up
a challenge. IC’s sabre victory was
still by a fairly solid 14 hits, but
with Cambridge being significantly
stronger in both epee (27-45) and
foil (22-45) they had to accept an
overall defeat (94-121).
The following day, the girls joined
them on the adjacent piste. Ahead
of them were the last two matches
of the league, against Cambridge
and UCL, whilst the guys had only
the newcomers UWE left. The lat-
ter match was not expected to be a
big challenge, based on their perfor-
mance against the other teams, so it
came as no surprise that the sabreurs
quickly finished their match (45-17)
and left it to the foilists (45-40) and
epeeists (45-44) to wrap it up.
Alongside this, the girls started off
facing Cambridge, a team they had
already beaten away earlier in the
season. Both the epeeists and foilists
were able to increase their indicators
this time, from 43-44 to 45-42 for the
former and 34-45 to 38-45 for the
latter. This meant that sabre wasn’t
under much pressure, but they still
had to win the match for us to win
overall. The results from last time
(45-25) indicated that the task wasn’t
going to prove too tough, however
all three girls had recently suffered
from injuries and illness and strug-
gled especially against Cambridge’s
strong Polish sabreur. The rest of
the team couldn’t do anything but
watch and cheer, but they were not
to be disappointed: the match ended
45-38 to Imperial and they were just
one match away from a clean sweep.
The epeeists had warmed up to
take on UCL, a weapon match that
had been lost last time due to some
team changes. With a 10 hit victory
in memory, UCL seemed confident
that it was going to be similar this
time and as a result gradually got
more shocked as they lost hit after
hit, reaching a final score of 45-28.
The sabreurs took over and showed
no mercy with heroic efforts in the
final bouts to produce a stunning
score at 45-17, meaning that even
if UCL was to win foil by 45-0 they
could not win overall. IC’s foilists re-
laxed, happy to avoid any pressure,
whilst UCL were fencing for their
own pride. The final result landed
on 41-45, a comfortable overall IC
victory of 135-90. The two IC teams
celebrated the end of the weekend
with some pizza, working on prepar-
ing the guys mentally for the second
leg of the league the following week-
end.
Fencing gives you wings!
