This week you go skiing on
Hampstead Heath because
it’s the closest thing London
has to a mountain and there
are even some gnarly trees.
But after a close shave with
an abandoned picnic blan-
ket you have a nasty fall and
your ski pole lodges 6 inches
up your bum. Good luck ex-
plaining that one to your GP!
This week you try a new pull-
ing strategy. After an accept-
able period of eye contact and
sweaty grinding, you move
in like a cobra, weaving from
side to side to hypnotise her.
She could be the one to charm
your snake! But she backs
away, revolted when you start
hissing ‘seductively’. Creepy
clearly isn’t the new sexy.
This week you are fist-pump-
ing so fast that you break the
sound barrier. The resulting
sonic boom sends you over
the edge and you let the pres-
sure waves wash over you in
ecstasy. As your vision clears
(or was that the vapour cone?),
you realise you’ve just had the
world’s first supersonic wank.
Your parents will be so proud.
This week you buy some
‘study’ pills from a dodgy
dealer and take one before
your deadline the next day. But
soon your feet start twitching
and you can’t stop your teeth
grinding. Next thing you know
it’s 8am and you’re shuffling to
imaginary techno in the corner
of the library. It wasn’t quite the
all-nighter you were expecting.
Thisweekyourhandissomuch
pain from pipetting all day that
you snort some paracetamol
for faster relief. In the cold light
of day it’s invisible, but when
using the UV lamp the glow-
ing white residual powder on
your nostril is exposed to your
supervisor. Too embarrassed
to admit snorting painkillers,
you’re expelled for drug use.
This week when pushing the
treadmill, you see a rare 8/10
lifting weights. Seeing an op-
portunity for your first not pitch-
black/doggy-style shag since
coming to Imperial, you ramp
up the speed to impress him.
But concentrating too hard on
your sexy pout, you lose bal-
ance and fall off the end. He,
and the entire gym laugh at you.
This week you are so busy
with coursework that per-
sonal hygiene is forgotten un-
til you notice a film of mould
growing between your toes.
You scrape it off, and keep
scraping but there’s more and
eventually you scrape off your
entire toe. You stare sadly at
the flakes of blackened, re-
dundant flesh on your carpet.
This week you run out of
food and can’t be bothered
to go 100m down the road to
Tesco Express. You decide to
use your shit as your dinner
ingredient – there are sure to
be some nutrients and fibre
your gut missed the first time.
You grill it until crispy on the
outside but still tender inside:
cooked to poofection!
This week you are desperate
for a pee but your lecture is
so interesting that you can’t
face leaving to go to the toilet
in case you miss something
extra-exciting. You lose the
battle with your bladder, but
it doesn’t matter because
the lecturer just referenced
a figure from one of his own
papers!
This week you are sick of
the verruca that your foot
has been harbouring over
the last 3 years. You try
to get rid of it by gouging
it out with scissors but it
grows back, twelve times
as big. It learns to speak
and starts insulting you ev-
ery time you cut your toe-
nails.
This week you are constantly
followed by a giant rat that
bites your ankle every time
you make a grammatical mis-
take. Confusing your/you’re,
or improper use of two/too/to
induce particularly agonising
lacerations. By the end of the
week your ankle is a bloody
mess but your grammar is
perfect. No pain, no gain!
This week you have to choose
between having your toe
hairs plucked out one by one
(if you don’t think this is that
bad, try it and see) or hav-
ing a monobrow for a week.
Plucking toe hairs is super
painful but would at least be
over quickly, while the mono-
brow would be ugly but pain-
less. What’s it going to be?
the horoscopes – what’s wrong with lowercase?
