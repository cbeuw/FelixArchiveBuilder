The Jewel in the Coronet
Alex Savell Film Writer
If my undergrad is anything to go
by most people don’t spend a huge
amount of time in Notting Hill Gate.
You might make it up to Edgeware
Road or into Bayswater for a year
but for the most part those I know
spend most of their time hanging
out in Fulham or Shepherd’s Bush.
Everything in Notting Hill Gate is
overpriced and there’s not really
that much there right? Wrong. The
Coronet Cinema is a hidden gem
that is not to be missed. Independ-
ent cinemas are much less numer-
ous than they used to be as the big
cinema chains are able to offer more
films at more times in more loca-
tions. Those that survive are gener-
ally forced to find some niche to fit
into; foreign movies or arts films,
etc; unable to afford the high prices
for studio blockbusters on the limit-
ed showings and audience sizes they
can manage.
Not so the Coronet Cinema.
Though they only manage four
films at any one time and can only
have limited showings each day
on their two screens, the Coronet
manages to survive in an industry
where big business usually wears
the crown. You would assume then
that the prices they charge must be
extortionate; directly on Notting
Hill Gate, trying to survive, how
could they not be? Well I’m not sure
but at £7.50 a ticket they manage to
beat the price of most top cinemas.
Perhaps the lack of the 3D and HFR
gimics of modern multiscreen keeps
their costs down. So what’s the
drawback? Well so far as I can tell
there isn’t one! An old theatre build-
ing means that both screens are in a
beautiful rooms that feel more like
going to a play than a film and the
quirky “No Smoking” and “Coming
Soon” ads that seem to have been
there since the early 90s give the
place a nostalgic feel that really gets
you in the mood.
If that’s not enough for you, why
not go on their student night? On
a Monday it makes a great alterna-
tive to Orange Wednesdays, espe-
cially for anyone that maybe plays
sport on a Wednesday afternoon.
The price then goes down to £3.50
a ticket! And you get your popcorn
for a whopping £1.50. Or, you could
choose to eschew the popcorn and
have a cheeky glass of wine or any
other kiosk item on the same offer.
So a large glass of wine, and The
Hobbit for a fiver? I’d pay more than
that in quite a lot of pubs, and I’d
probably get a worse seat too!

103 Notting Hill Gate
London
Katy Bettany Film Editor
Hyde Park on Hudson
Director: Roger Michell
Screenwriter: Richard Nelson
Starring: Bill Murray, Laura Linney,
Samuel West, Olivia Coleman
It is sometime in June 1939, at Frank-
lin D Roosevelt’s (Murray) private es-
tate, upstate New York. Europe is on
the brink of war, and King George V
(West) and Queen Elizabeth (Cole-
man) are about to become the ﬁrst
British monarchs ever to visit Amer-
ica, in a bid to improve relations and
convince America to assist them in
a War that was understood to be in-
evitable. Most of the ﬁlm takes place
during the weekend of the Royal visit;
the rest documents FDR’s dalliances
with several women other than his
wife Eleanor, (including the ﬁlm’s
narrator, Daisy (Linney), his sixth
cousin, intimate friend, and later,
lover).
At times, the screenplay is too
obvious and scripting lacks punch.
Linney’s narration can be melodra-
matic and cliched - in fact, overall her
character is not much of a testament
to Linney’s skill as an actress. Daisy is
plain, and altogether quite dull when
compared to the eclectic Eleanor,
who in contrast shines as the show-
wife; columnist and closet lesbian.
In a ﬁlm that was always going to be
compared with the Academy Award
winning ‘he King’s Speech’, West
and Coleman had big shoes to ﬁll in
playing the monarchs. West plays the
struggling George well, portraying a
man desperate to step out from un-
derneath his brothers shadow; and be
the kind of King he believes the Brit-
ish public deserve. Coleman is enter-
taining, but no Bonham Carter, and
her obsession with the secret mean-
ing behind food-types and occasional
outbursts at her likable husband do
not endear her.
Murray is the star of the ﬁlm -
playing the invalid President with
great timing and a jaunty good tem-
per. In a touching moment shared
in Roosevelt’s study, the two men
compare ailments: the King with his
now infamous stutter, and Roosevelt
with his useless Polio crippled legs.
Roosevelt bolsters the King’s conﬁ-
dence, revealing that his disability is
not seen and ignored, but simply not
seen: the American people choose
what they want to see in a leader. We
see Murray provide a sort of father-
ﬁgure to the young King in the cen-
tral scene of the ﬁlm.
Daisy’s relationship with the Presi-
dent is intended to be an explora-
tion of the intimacies and nuances of
friendship, but falls short. When FDR
receives what has been described as
‘cinema’s most PG-rated handjob’
(not an exaggeration), his relation-
ship with his distant cousin moves
into the icky league; and Linney’s
night-time forest running pushes it
into the melodramatic. More than
this though, is the odd positioning
of this not-quite-love story with the
serious business of international rela-
tions. he relationship between the
President and the King was far more
interesting, and more time should
have been spent developing this rela-
tionship.
Part period biopic, part comic, this
verges from the funny, to dull, to
the distinctly queasy. Fantastic sets,
soundtrack and costuming capture
Depression America perfectly; and
countless panoramic shots of upstate
New York make this a visually pretty
piece that nonetheless probably has
more style than it does substance.
Alice...all grown
up now...
