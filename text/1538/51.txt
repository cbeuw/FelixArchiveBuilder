Hashi Ophis
Connect all the is-
lands with bridges
so that you can get
from any island to any
other one. There are
restrictions, though:
the bridges have to be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must
not intersect. You can
have up to two bridg-
es between any two
islands and, last but
not least, each island
must have exactly as
many bridges stem-
ming from it as the
number on it.
Fill the cells with a
continuous line (the
“snake”) that does
not pass through a
cell twice, doesn’t
intersect with itself,
and passes through
all white boxes. The
numbers show you
how many times the
snake turns in the
corresponding row
or column. The snake
enters and exits the
grid at the shown
points (and only
those points). There
are some hints to get
you started.
