FRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY
STUDENT FIGHTS
JOB ADVERSITY
CUMBERBATCH
NOT SPOTTED NEAR
CAMPUS
An enterprising student is un-
dertaking the hellish task of attend-
ing 30 assessment centres over 30
days in order to raise awareness
about the fact that he wants a job.
John Dominance, a final year
student, hopes to raise £50,000
from the challenge, a sum which
he says will “go towards me and
my unending quest for a job”.
When asked whether the constant
travelling, group exercises, interviews
and blue-sky thinking will detrimen-
tally affect his degree results, Domi-
nance said, “I have a positive outlook
about the whole thing. You just need
to believe in yourself and be yourself,
then everything will sort itself out.”
As part of the task, Dominance
must wear a suit and tie for the du-
ration, including when he sleeps,
“if I sleep at all,” he continued, “I
work hard and I play hard. That’s
what recruiters want to see.”
“At the end of the day, it’s for
charity. Sure, the charity might
be me, but it’s still for charity.
Who could be against that?”
Rumours of a Benedict Cum-
berbatch sighting outside South
Kensington Station on Monday
turned out to be just that - rumours.
Much to the disappointment of
the Star Trek Into Darkness actor’s
die-hard Imperial-based fans, it
was confirmed later in the day that
the Sherlock star was not enjoy-
ing the ambience of Wafflemeister.
The rumours, thought to originate
from an individual in the Library
Café, were swiftly quashed by the
same individual, who confusingly
clarified that he “thought that [not-
Cumberbatch] looked a little like Mr
Cumberbatch, not that it was him”.
Not everyone was disappointed
by these revelations. A second year
Civil Engineering student who wishes
to remain anonymous due to the in-
evitable backlash told Trash Talk: “I
don’t really care whether or not it was
him. Personally I think his portrayal of
Sherlock Holmes isn’t all that great.”
“That’s just typical anti-Cumber-
batch slander ,” said one fervent ad-
mirer from the Biology department.
Coffee Break sits down with the Editor-in-Chief of
Felix to get to the bottom of things once and for all
TRASH
TALK Cutting to the heart of
the week’s big topics
Hard-hitting interview
aking the 74 bus is an ex-
perience any day of the
week, but this particular
journey towards College
is fraught with danger.
Danger of an intellectual format. It’s
dangerous because I’m desperately
formulating a way of writing an intro-
duction for this interview. A child in a
buggy throws a stern stare in my direc-
tion that can only say, “don’t go, don’t
go…”. Of course, the infant is, in ac-
tual fact, incapable of human speech,
a fact which steadies my nerves. he
bus grinds to a halt and a quick walk
along Queens Gate and into the West
Basement of Imperial College Union
brings me to my destination.
I’m here to talk to the current Edi-
tor-in-Chief of Felix, Tim Arbabza-
dah. Following his medium-rare grill-
ing of the current sabbaticals over the
past few weeks, Coﬀee Break has tak-
en the opportunity to turn the tables,
as it were, and interrogate him. What
does he think are the most pressing
issues that students currently face?
What drives him? Face-to-face with
the man, would I even have the nerve
to ask such questions?
Opening the door, we instantly greet
each other, as people generally do:
Coﬀee Break: Hi Tim.
Tim Arbabzadah: Hi.
CB: How tall are you?
TA: 5 foot 4.
CB: hat’s an interesting height. Do
you think you’re tall enough to be in
the position of Felix Editor?
TA: Yeah, there have been Editors of
the shorter persuasion before and
they’ve had a great time.
CB: You’ve painted a wall in the of-
ﬁce with blackboard paint so people
can write on it. Isn’t that a waste of a
perfectly decent blank wall?
TA: I don’t think so, there was only a
framed picture of London hanging on
it before, and it wasn’t even that good.
CB: Fair enough. Who or what are
your main inﬂuences?
TA: John Oliver from he Daily Show
along with Danny Dyer’s subtle per-
formance in his latest ﬁlm, Run for
Your Wife.
CB: Cool. Who invented the foun-
tain pen?
TA: Petrache Poenaru.
CB: Good knowledge.
TA: I thought we were going to be dis-
cussing stuﬀ that’s important to stu-
dents, like fees.
CB: I get a bit nervous when I give
interviews.
And on that groundbreaking note,
I cut the interview short and left the
oﬃce.
So what did I learn from this meet-
ing of the minds? I now understand
that the Felix Editor has an impressive
knowledge of the history of the foun-
tain pen, a skill that undoubtedly lends
itself to the production of a weekly pa-
per.
