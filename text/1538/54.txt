On a crisp sunny January Sunday
morning, (or a continuation of Sat-
urday evening depending on who
you ask), 30 of Imperial’s ﬁnest, the
IC and RSM teams, faced-oﬀ at Har-
lington Sports Ground for an epic
Mixed hockey match and a half time
boat race. he two components of the
match up are ﬁercely contested al-
lowing both teams to show oﬀ their
strengths!
We had a slightly late start as we
needed to allow time for the force of
the RSM to lower their blood alco-
hol levels, then commenced a match
of epic proportions. humbs were
caught in pockets, guys were slide
tackling girls, sticks made contact
with opposition’s heads; these are just
a few examples of the mayhem that
proceeded to take place. With trig-
ger-happy umpires, one would think
that the players would take a more
serious tone to the match, but the
spirit of mixed hockey won through
with the casual disregard of general
hockey rules and nonchalant attitude.
his was a fun match but there was
certainly a ﬁghting attitude from both
sides as can only be expected from
highly competitive Imperial students!
he ﬁrst half began with both teams
well-matched, and plenty of attempts
on goal coming from both sides. Af-
ter a bit of a tussle, Rooster managed
to net the ﬁrst goal of the match for
IC. his gained a slight momentum
shift for IC as another one. his time
pressure from IC resulted in a RSM
own goal by the surprisingly fully
clothed Matt Webb! his was unlucky
On a balmy Wednesday afternoon,
ICURFC travelled to the all weather
pitch at Maidenhead RFC for a dou-
ble header match against Reading
Uni.
Top of the league Reading were
always going to be a tough physical
match, and playing it on the plastic
grass pitch was only going to add to
the drama and pace of this crucial
game.
After a brief and intense warm up,
IC kicked off. Captain Jack made the
initial hit on the catching Reading
player and drove him into the rubber
crumb. Imperial held their ground
for a couple of phases, however
Reading looked good on the counter,
and after an initial break were mak-
ing good yards.
An isolated Imperial munster run-
ner had the ball tackled off him on
the halfway line and Reading were
away. Three quick passes and some
pace on the wing put Imperial 5-0
down after five minutes. The con-
version was close to the touch-
line and the kick was poor so the
shellshocked Imperial kicked off
again, only five points down.
This time the defence held firm
for around fifteen minutes, with
great work by Tom Chavas, knee
chopping everything that dared run
at him. New prop Pierre L’Bour was
an inspiration in the front row, haul-
ing his weighty frame around the
park and doing all the donkey work
asked of him. While relatively inex-
perienced in the dark art of the front
row, he was still confident explain-
ing to the ex-premiership referee
what was happening, much to every-
one else’s amusement.
At this stage in the game, neither
team was making many yards as
both defences remained firm; Impe-
rial managed to stem the yards they
were previously haemorrhaging un-
til a scrum finally managed to un-
lock the Imperial back line. After the
initial line break, the Reading backs
flooded through, and touched down
close to the posts. Luckily, the sec-
ond kick was as bad as the first and
so IC were only 10-0 down.
Reassuring words from Birkett
in the huddle under the posts to
stick to our guns, play pattern and
remain calm were listened to. IC
surged forward off the kick off,
with many controlled short phases
tiring the Reading defence before
some sublime handling on the left
wing by O’Connell and Floyd sent
Syarif darting towards the try line.
Hauled down five meters out, the
Reading defence scrambled to slow
the ball down, which meant George
Lane, the boy from up North, had to
do some rucking, for which he got
kicked in the head. After checking
that he hadn’t broken his eye socket
like his hero, Chris McGeough, a
quick dab of Vas and he was back in
the game. In their desperate attempt
to avoid conceding a try, the Reading
flyhalf dove into from the side of the
ruck and threw the ball away. The
resultant penalty was kicked out on
the five metre line. The always domi-
nant lineout went up, and the maul
went over the line with ease, L’Bour
touching down a well deserved try,
which Cox, on the wide angle, failed
to convert.
With the momentum clearly on
their side, Imperial received the kick
off for the second half with practiced
precision and restarted the pressure
on the Reading defence. However,
the advice to ‘keep calm’ at half
time hadn’t been heeded by Floyd,
who cynically stopped a Reading
counterattack on the left flank with
a deliberate knock on. An immedi-
ate yellow card left Imperial a man
down in the backs. However this did
not deter the forwards who contin-
ued to dominate the larger opposi-
tion pack with their sheer intensity.
The pressure on the Reading defence
built and built until eventually they
cracked. With Coxy taking the ball
to the line and drifting along the
defence, Lane cut a hard line back
and strolled through two poor at-
tempts to tackle before putting the
ball down under the posts. A simple
conversion for Cox put Imperial in
the lead by two points.
From the kick off, Reading camped
in the Imperial 22 for 15 minutes
before coming away with a penalty
which put them in the lead.
With only ten minutes remaining,
and a point down, Imperial threw
everything they had at Reading.
Hard yards gained by Hardisty and
Flanagan, and the always impres-
sive maul, which made 10-25 yards
a time, kept Imperial within strik-
ing distance of the Reading line,
but to no avail. After a turned over
ball, Reading played out the last two
minutes with pick and goes and the
game ended with them a point up.
The entire pack to a man excelled
themselves, particularly Olisa Ufo-
diama who was at the bottom of eve-
rything, legally and illegally, like a
good 6 should be.
By the end of the game, the ground
was littered with Reading players,
who admitted that Imperial were
‘one of the best drilled and hardest
rucking teams’ they’d played against.
Despite the loss, this was one of the
gutsiest and best performances of
the year and if they can string to-
gether a few more performances like
this one, ICURFC will stay in Prem
B, and deservedly so.

but he is now the RSM mixed top goal
scorer. his led to a 2-0 advantage for
IC at the end of the ﬁrst half.
hen came the opportunity for
RSM to show that though they were
losing the hockey match, their more
experienced social life gave them an
advantage for the half-time entertain-
ment: the boat race. Unfortunately
IC already started with a disadvan-
tage due to their choice of beverage.
hough IC valiantly tried their best,
RSM won the race almost a whole
person ahead with ﬁre in their bel-
lies and having rehydrated the RSM
started the second half with renewed
conﬁdence.
Unfortunately despite a valiant ef-
fort a dramatic comeback was not on
the cards for RSM. Matt Webb put his
body on the line to save a goal (this is
sadly against the rules of hockey) so
a penalty ﬂick was awarded against
the RSM crushing their hopes of a
comeback. he ﬂick was successfully
converted by Banana Split (Harriet
Stevenson). A win was cemented with
the ﬁnal goal of the match by Flexi
Vadge. herefore the ﬁnal score was
four goals for IC to one boat race win
to RSM.
