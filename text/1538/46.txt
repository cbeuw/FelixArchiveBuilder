I know most of you have connected
the above phrase with Las Vegas, but
I decided it’s high time that we turned
our attention also to Los Angeles and
its hidden gems. From the moment
you land there, you really feel you are
in a truly cosmopolitan city, which at
the same time features lots of green
areas, beaches and recreational ac-
tivities. It’s diﬃcult to comment on
every aspect of this city, but I will try
to draw a general image of what it has
to oﬀer and basically appealed to me.
On the one hand you can ﬁnd the
rich and glorious neighbourhoods,
that accommodate all our favourite
actors and TV stars, like Beverly Hills
and Bel Air. Of course it is not neces-
sary to be one of those to appreciate
these areas, as everybody can walk
around these neighbourhoods and
just admire what is way over his/her
budget for sure and dream that maybe
one day he/she can aﬀord something
similar (dream a little dream). But
even so the architecture of the houses,
the parks and the shops are worth a
visit.
On the other hand there are also
famous beaches in the vicinity of the
city, just a short bus ride away. To start
with there is the Santa Monica Beach,
where one can swim, surf or if afraid
of the ocean (like me) can just walk by
the beach and reach the Venice Beach
on foot. Along the way there are lots
of small shops to browse and just en-
joy the walk. he most famous beach
of course is without saying Malibu,
home to many TV stars as well, and
has become more famous due to the
series Two and a Half Men. his beach
oﬀers a nice beach to swim but most-
ly surf. Lastly I want to mention the
also well known “Long Beach”, which
despite being a rather long bus ride
away, is worth the travel. he view of
the area is magniﬁcent especially dur-
ing sunset and this area also oﬀers a
wide range of restaurants and cof-
fee shops to just relax and enjoy the
view. All these beaches are a great way
to escape the hectic rhythms of the
city, but I would advise to avoid go-
ing there on a Sunday since it can get
quite crowded.
Of course how can I omit the most
famous landmark of Los Angeles, Hol-
lywood?! Walk on the famous “Walk
of Fame” and discover the star of your
favourite actor on the pavement and
just walk around the area to enter the
magical world of movies. To conclude
the visit, one should deﬁnitely visit the
Griﬃth Observatory, from which the
view of the entire city is breathtaking.
It is actually possible to see from there
how many diﬀerent areas comprise
this glorious and huge city.
Obviously Los Angeles has a vast
oﬀer of shops all around the city. My
favourite places would have to be
the Grove Mall, with a wide range of
shops and restaurants and also close
by the farmer’s market with food from
all over the world. It is worth paying a
visit to those places!
My suggestion overall is to visit
Los Angeles as it combines perfectly
the life of a big city with many rec-
reational possibilities to forget the
humdrum of modern life... Also the
temperature there is more or less the
same throughout the year, so all can
ﬁnd some time and a cheap bargain
to visit it. What are you waiting for?
