Heatwave at the corona
http://sottyreview.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/why-does-the-moon-stay-with-earth/
he enormous fusion furnace at the
centre of our solar system has been
continually belting out light and heat
for the past 4.6 billion years since its
formation. From the distance the
Earth lies from the sun, the solar
rays are strong enough to warm the
atmosphere to around 20-30°C. he
sun’s surface is understandably hot-
ter – with measurements around the
6000°C mark. But one question which
has had solar physicists baﬄed is that
its corona – the particulate layer above
the surface – has temperatures meas-
uring up to 4,000,000°C. So where’s all
this extra heat coming from?
Other than the regular conduction
heating from the photosphere below,
theories have been put forward that
wave heating is a contributor. Jona-
than Cirtain, a solar physicist at NA-
SA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in
Alabama explains that sound waves,
caused by friction and vibrations
within the sun, travel to the surface
and deliver energy in the form of heat.
Calculations using this model lead
to a coronal temperature estimate of
only 1,500,000°C, so while this theory
is enough in cooler regions of the co-
rona, there is something more hap-
pening in the warmer regions which is
more than doubling the temperature.
Recently, Cirtain and colleagues
have gathered evidence in support of
another theory focusing on the sun’s
magnetic ﬁeld. he team sent out a
rocket equipped with the High-res-
olution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) into
space last July. he resolution of Hi-C
was 0.2 arcseconds; enough to pin-
point features on the sun as small as
150 kilometres (which is comparable
to spotting a 5 pence piece from 6
kilometres away).
he camera-telescope was set to
measure the extreme parts of the ul-
traviolet spectrum (with wavelengths
at 193 Ångström) that are usually
blocked by the Earth’s own atmos-
phere, with the aim of observing the
emission lines of Fe XII atoms (iron
atoms which have had 11 electrons
in their outer shells ejected). Despite
venturing out for a total of 5 minutes,
observing a mere 3% of the sun’s sur-
face in this time, two distinct episodes
were observed where the magnetic
ﬁeld strongly interacted to produce Fe
XII. hese contortions of the magnet-
ic ‘braids’ would release enough en-
ergy to raise temperatures to as high
as 7,000,000°C. It is likely that these
interactions occur fairly regularly in
magnetically-active areas of the sun,
providing overall coronal heating,
bringing temperature estimates closer
to those measured.
he theory that magnetic braids
(strands of magnetic ﬁeld) were being
unravelled and reconnected has been
theoretically proposed before, but it
lacked substantial evidence. Cirtain
and his team have now observed re-
sults that can provide ﬁrmer backing
to the theory.
“he new ﬁndings are a tantalizing
glimpse of what is possible with such
an instrument,” says Peter Cargill, an
Imperial College solar physicist. Even
with this limited glance into solar
mechanisms, the new apparatus de-
veloped is still enough to test many
old hypotheses, and to develop new
ones. he next step will hopefully be
to develop instruments which can
orbit Earth full time, providing a con-
tinual stream of data pertaining to the
sun and its unusually hot corona.
