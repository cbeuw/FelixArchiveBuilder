pple have undeniably
changed the world. It
used to be the most
valuable company on
Earth, ever. Now, stock-
holders are insecure and other brands
have come close, if not eclipsed, the
atmosphere of ‘coolness’ that Apple
once made its own. Have they divert-
ed oﬀ their successful path, have they
done wrong? Or is this just a momen-
tarily glitch?
Humble beginnings
Let’s quickly summarise Apple’s ori-
gins, as to understand the future, you
have to know about the past. Estab-
lished on the 1st of April by Steve Jobs,
Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.
Apple Computer Inc, as it was known
in the early days, was quite success-
ful; they sold the Apple I and Apple II,
the latter being one of the ﬁrst highly
successful microcomputers made. Its
success is mostly accredited to its ease
of use, and utility programs (e.g. Visi-
Calc, the ﬁrst spreadsheet program).
After the release of the unsuccessful
Apple III, came the era of the Lisa
computer and the Macintosh. Dur-
ing this time the ﬁrst fractures were
seen between the Apple board and
Jobs. hus after an attempted putsch,
Jobs was forced out of the company in
1985. he next ﬁve years were relative-
ly successful for Apple, even without
Jobs. However, then things started to
go downhill. Mismanagement, waste-
ful uses of resources and overwhelm-
ingly confusing product lines left the
consumer at a loss, leading to Apple’s
decline. Facing bankruptcy, Jobs was
brought back as an advisor and then
interim CEO. He then restructured
the whole company. He retired sev-
eral products, released revolutionary
new ones (iPod, iMac etc.) and gener-
ally changed the business model that
Apple used. It still took Apple a while
to really achieve mainstream success,
but things were looking up. In 2007,
with the release of the iPhone, Ap-
ple was on the way to the top,
and eventually became
the most valuable con-
sumer-directed com-
pany in the world.
hen Jobs was diag-
nosed with pancre-
atic cancer, which
severely aﬀected
his day to day
running, forcing
him to take medi-
cal leave. his leave
aﬀected the stock
market, with Apple
losing several percent
in trading the following
days. Jobs passed away
on 5th October 2011. Fol-
lowing Job’s death, Apple
have gone from strength to
strength, becoming the world’s
most valuable company. However,
now Apple’s stock is down, specula-
tors are doubting them to stay ahead
of the game.
Effect: Jobs
here we have it. So what conclusions
can we draw from this? Firstly, I think

if Jobs would still be around, Apple
would be doing better. Job’s perfec-
tionist management style, ability to
say no and general revolutionary view
of technology are what made Apple
what it is. He was the god of the com-
pany, and inspired all his employees to
apply themselves to the best of their
abilities, and forcing all the big egos of
Apple to work together to create great
products. In fact when Cook took
over, Forstall (head of iOS) was asked
to leave after some high proﬁle mis-
takes in iOS 6 (e.g. Maps). However
it seems the real reason of his
“ﬁring” was his feud with
Jonathan Ives, award-
winning designer,
who designed,
amongst others,
the iPod, iMac
and iPhone,

was kept at bay by Jobs.
his unique approach to leading a
company, gave Apple the reputation
of being a company that has the best
quality products that you can trust.
With the advent of ‘Mapgate’, this
reputation is starting to erode. Also,
it seems that the company is
also resting on its laurels.
While for any business
with $86 billion in the
bank and record prof-
its, this may seem quite
okay, however, for Apple okay
should not be enough.
Effect: No Jobs
he release of the iPad Mini, and
rumours of a low budget phone
also worry me. his reminds
me too much of the ﬁrst
non-Jobs era. he one
product per func-
tion approach was
perfectly work-
able, and with new
hybrid products the
consumer will be con-
fused about what is re-
ally best for them.
A lack of revolutionary
products is also a key factor in
Apple’s sinking. While Apple was
known for creating something new
every year, or doing something
that really kicked the market’s
butt. With the last few keynotes
though, starting with the iPhone
4S, Apple hasn’t really done any-
thing new. Yes, the iPhone 5 has a
bigger screen, but that is just a re-
action to the market. In fact so is
the iPad Mini. Apple is reacting to
others, instead of setting a stand-
ard of being the proactive one.
Effect: Android et all
However, not only internal factors
have led to Apple’s decline in the
recent weeks. Increased pressure
from Android, Windows 8 and the
Samsung Galaxy line in particular
have not really helped. iOS is still a
good operating system, if a bit out-
dated. Androids great modiﬁabil-
Apple, sweet or sour outlook?
Maximilian Eggl dissects the taste of the future for the fruity company
ity has lead to the decline in the iP-
hone OS, and now with Windows 8,
a great operating system in its own
right, it ain’t getting better for the
Cupertino based ﬁrm. Also a very
smart marketing campaign by Sam-
sung has really damaged Apple’s rep
as the coolest product around. In
fact, many people see Apple as being
dependable, for their parents, but
not for themselves.
So what?
his apparent downfall does depress
me somewhat. I used to get excited be-
fore Apple keynotes (sad, yes I know)
because I knew something amazing
would be on show. Nowadays, I tune
in just to keep up with what’s happen-
ing. Apple need something or some-
one to kick it in the backside and get
it going. Steve Jobs is not around to
do that anymore. Cook, seems able,
but he has not been faced with a crisis
before. All the Android fanboys and
Windows fanatics, are probably over-
joyed that this tech giant is possibly in
decline. But think on this, without Ap-
ple there would not be an Ultrabook,
smartphone, tablet, app-based market
like there is today. If Apple doesn’t go
back to its old self, we’ll never know
what we could have had.

Job’s death,

Tim Cook the right man for the job(s) to save Apple?
Apple is in a fragile state, just
like their products, as this 1” drop
proves.
