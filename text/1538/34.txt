FRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY
Sharon Van Etten: This lady is no Tramp
If the highlights of 2012’s musi-
cal oﬀering involved bitching about
Lana Del Ray’s face, swagging with
Odd Future, or simply dancing like
a drunk antelope to a Korean pop
mega-hit, then I fear the album of
the last year has passed you by like a
proverbial leaf in a stream. Sharon
Van Etten’s third album Tramp was
a piece of the purest beauty which
had the critics purring but may have
failed to make a nest in the public
consciousness. Miss Van Etten’s re-
cord is more delicate and fragile than
anything created by the nymph-like
Laura Marling and she has just as
many connections to Brooklyn cool
as Karen O, so I ﬁnd it a travesty
that it did not feature more highly on
album of the year lists. I jumped at
the opportunity to review her recent
show at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire,
and boy, I wasn’t let down!
he night started oﬀ with two
newer songs ‘All I Can’ and ‘Warsaw’
which set the tone for a fantastic
evening. At ﬁrst glance, the Brooklyn
based singer seemed a little intimi-
dated by the surroundings and she
apologised for having a cold, but by
the end of the night the packed out
Mark England Music Editor venue was eating from the palm of
her hands. Having only recently be-
come aware of her, I was not familiar
with the older songs but numbers like
‘Save Yourself’ and ‘Don’t Do It’ were
very refreshing and gave her a heavy,
grungier live sound. For all the beau-
tiful melodies and swooning guitars,
my highlights were her lyrics; Tramp
is an album based in heartache and
breakups and there is no venom
spared. One cannot help being taken
aback by the overwhelming honesty
and bitterness of ‘Serpents’ when the
lines “You enjoy sucking on dreams, so
I will fall asleep, with someone other
than you” are uttered. I found myself
becoming immersed in her fragile,
bittersweet world in ‘Ask’ where Sha-
ron whispers “like cigarette ash, [my
world] is collapsing around me”.
Before the show, I knew how strong
Van Etten’s recent releases were, but
what I was not prepared for was how
accomplished a live performer she has
become. Her beautifully lilting voice
reminds me of the late Jeﬀ Buckley
and there is not much higher praise
than that. I left Shepherd’s Bush with
a smile on my face, and I noticed that
every other person exiting the venue
sported exactly the same expression;
we had all seen something very spe-
cial, and we knew it.

Mohammad Mirza finds a fat slice of Brooklyn in Shepherds Bush
fter their successful
release of Fragrant
World, Yeasayer de-
cided to grace the
Shepherd’s Bush Em-
pire with a set list heavy on songs
from their latest album. In the air
was a whiff of dope.
The crowd roared as the band
took to their space station, which
was designed to look like a stage.
Kicking off with the well layered
‘Blue Paper’, it took them only a
couple of minutes before they had
turned the night into a dance party.
The enthusiastic performance
given by Chris Keating, Anand
Wilder’s bold vocals and Ira Wolf
Tuton’s slippery bass groans, and
not to mention the lively drums
brought in by Cale Parks really came
together well. They let each other’s
music ease in and it never felt as if
they were stretching it. Yeasayer re-
ally sounded like four guys playing
music.
Too cool for cliché, they distorted
the first few notes of their psyche-
delicious songs just to leave the
crowd guessing. ‘2080’ from their
first album, All Hour Cymbals made
the cut with its harmonised chorus
and their acclaimed single ‘Longev-
ity’ was a tasty addition with Keat-
ing’s breathy squeals and chirps
adding another layer of life to the
song.
The ending of ‘Longevity’ transi-
tioned into an improvised intro to
‘O.N.E.’ which in my opinion was
one of the most entertaining tracks,
recreated with bursting tempo
and manifesting a pretty bold and
beautiful performance from Wilder
who accentuated the lyrics with his
strong vocals. I am such a fan.
You could nod your head along to
‘Madder Red’s very catchy yet psy-
chedelic tune which morphed into
‘Demon Road’ after which ‘Wait
for Summer’ flew over and around
the crowd lifted by the rich warm
synths and exotic guitars. ‘Ambling
Amp’ was a delightfully bright and
uplifting song well placed as the last
of the main set.
A four song encore ensued, start-
ing off with the compelling ‘Fingers
Never Bleed’ and finishing off with
the surprising addition ‘Folk Hero
Shtick’.
It is not very easy to translate such
delicate musical arrangements to
stage but Yeasayer performed admi-
rably. One never felt that the pre-re-
corded tracks and drum loops were
overplayed and most of what you
heard was refreshingly alive and or-
ganic. The quartet was exhilarating
both visually and sonically. They
absolutely killed it.
