FRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY
Smashing two concepts together is
a curious business - about as curi-
ous as the length of time that it takes
to travel between Knightsbridge and
South Kensington on the Piccadilly
Line. But who else to turn to than
Quentin Tarantino? With his latest
feature ﬁlm Django Unchained, he
has delivered a serious labour of love.
Already being tipped as a strong
contender for the Golden Globes,
Django Unchained is Tarantino’s
chance to go full Spaghetti West-
ern. Of course, it’s not that simple.
his, for want of a better phrase, is
a Southern Spaghetti Western - one
that tackles slavery head on.
And this celluloid slavery isn’t
simply a background element that’s
routinely passed over. Here it’s ugly,
it’s raw and it’s very real. here has
been talk among critics that this ﬁlm
fulﬁls some kind of adolescent de-
sire to slip racial slurs through the
censors, and while this is unﬂinch-
ing, fast-paced and kinetic, it’s never
played for poking fun at race or slav-
ery. Instead, much like Inglourious
Django Unchained
Director: Quentin Tarantino
Screenwriter: Quentin Tarantino
Starring: Jamie Foxx, Christoph
Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry
Washington, Samuel L. Jackson
Basterds was Tarantino’s ﬁlmic re-
venge on Hitler, here it’s his revenge
on the slave trade.
Acting almost as a companion
piece to the fast and loose histori-
cal nazi-scalping adventure, Django
Unchained again takes a past setting,
here the America of 1858. he plot
centres around slave Django (played
in a winning performance by Jamie
Foxx) searching the Deep South for
his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry
Washington). However, Christoph
Waltz steals the show once again fol-
lowing his turn as the diabolical Col.
Hans Landa in Basterds. As den-
tist turned bounty hunter Dr. King
Schultz, Waltz is at all times hugely
threatening with the capacity for vi-
olence and also an immensely pleas-
ant character.
Django and Schultz (whose horse,
Fritz, may be even more of a scene
stealer) buddy up as they traverse the
land as a bounty-hunting duo. It’s
not long before the duo come face-
to-face with vile plantation owner
Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).
Much focus has been placed on Di-
Caprio’s turn as the rotten toothed
villain. While you can tell he’s hav-
ing the time of his life, drawling it up
like nobody’s business, so are the rest
of the ensemble players, and it’s fan-
tastic to watch.
I could wax lyrical about the
strength of the cast: Kerry Washing-
ton brings a more-than-convincing
bilingual turn as Broomhilda, and
Samuel L. Jackson’s long awaited on-
screen return to the works of Taran-
tino pretty much gives everyone a
run for their money, portraying Can-
die’s nefarious and wholly loyal slave,
Stephen.
Other than a fantastic cast and
its colourful historical setting, it’s
the regular tension, much like in
Basterds, that is at once unbearable
and gripping. One major scene fea-
turing the majority of the main cast
ratchets up the stress to an almost
ungodly degree before letting go.
And let go it does.
Indeed, it’s not a ﬁlm for the
squeamish (this is, after all, Quen-
tin Tarantino we’re talking about).
Blood splatters as freely as ever, and
the ﬁlm is unﬂinching in portraying
the barbarity of the slave trade. In re-
sponse to the standard questioning
of the amount of violence present,
Tarantino has spoken of his desire
to not gloss over the issues at hand.
Speaking to the Guardian, the di-
rector explained that “however bad
things get in the movie, a lot worse
s*** actually happened.” Neverthe-
less, Django’s rampage through
the Deep South may call for a little
cringing.
It may also call for a toilet break if
you’ve poorly judged your hydration
before sitting down to watch it. It’s a
reliably lengthy beast, clocking in at
nearly three hours. However, while
the ﬁlm never outstayed its welcome,
there were a couple of detours in a
kind of ‘whirlwind slavery tour’ that
didn’t quite jam. his includes a se-
quence where Django and Schultz
encounter some fanatic racists. he
scene is played for laughs, but at least
to me the joke went on a little too
long. he folks at the screening thor-
oughly seemed to enjoy it though,
and it brought some of the evening’s
biggest laughs.
Events also seemed to build up to
a natural climax, before it transpired
that there was a good twenty min-
utes left on top of this. he ﬁnal act
features some memorable moments
(including an explosive sterling cam-
eo from a certain individual) but I
can’t help but shake the feeling that
the ﬁnal sequence comes sneaking
up out of nowhere.
In keeping with the genre, natu-
rally Spaghetti Western composer
legend Ennio Morricone turns up
to compose a original piece, but it’s
the anachronistic soundtrack that
sings. Rick Ross, the Teﬂon Don
himself, lends his dulcet tones for
one scene, but it’s a combination of
Tupac Shakur and James Brown that
brought the house down when paired
with a climactic set-piece of near or-
giastic violence.
It’s reliably over-the-top, funny and
brutal. Out of the two historical Tar-
antino ﬁlms however, I’d probably
just choose Basterds over Django, if
only because I personally preferred
the greater prevalence of tense dia-
logue over Django’s action set-pieces.
If you’re a fan, it’s essential. If you
aren’t sold on this particular brand,
then this is unlikely to sway your
opinion. If you’re stuck in the middle,
then delving headﬁrst into this tale
of southern slavery is well worth it.
