How to look good dead
was told once that the best
way to know a city is to get
lost in it. I can’t say if this is
a universal truth but with my
truly terrible sense of direc-
tion I’ve had plenty of chances to put
it to the test. It was just this Monday
that I made my favourite ﬁnding to
date. Bumbling around the mean
streets of Chelsea, lost and late for
a lecture, I took a shortcut through
Brompton Cemetery and turned a
ﬁve minute shortcut into a 30 minute
stroll, stopping at the most interest-
ing graves, walking around the diﬀer-
ent mausoleums and ensuring I was
more than fashionably late for that
lecture.
he cemetery houses the moulder-
ing great and the decaying good of
19th and early 20th Century London
and long ago reached capacity. But
what attracted me to the place was
not so much the architecture of the
various stone monuments as gaining
a snapshot of how people had cho-
sen to have themselves, or their loved
ones, remembered. To sum up one’s
life in the space of a gravestone, per-
haps the length of a tweet, is surely
impossible and yet something must
be written. It was looking at the dif-
ferent attempts at this “summing
up” that grabbed my attention for so
long and got me thinking about how
and why people pick certain graves.
For those of you considering dying
at some stage, here’s my handy cut-
out-and-keep guide to choosing your
grave. After all, if you get it wrong,
you won’t get the chance to change
your mind.
he ﬁrst consideration when choos-
ing your ﬁnal resting place is surely
location. Residents of Brompton
Cemetery clearly had this in mind by
picking the leaﬁest, poshest area in
the city. One of the saddest aspects
of death is its democratic nature – it
takes us all and treats us as if we were
the same. By buying a really swanky
location for your grave you ensure
I
Rory Fenton on posthumous presentation
that future generations will know just
how loaded you were. If you wouldn’t
be seen dead outside of SW, make
sure you aren’t.
Now after a long, hard life don’t you
deserve to decay in style? Cemetery
chic is very much in for when you
go under but choosing that perfect
tomb isn’t quite as simple as keep-
ing up with latest from the Milan
catwalk. You’ll want a timeless clas-
sic, something that endures through
the ages but is still totally “you” and
stands out. his absolutely means
that the classic “rounded rectangle”
gravestone is a no-no. Nothing says,
“I really wasn’t that much” like a mis-
erable rounded rectangle – it’s the
jeans and t-shirt of the grave world
and, darling, you deserve better. Not
all budgets stretch to it but a taste-
ful, life-sized statue of an angel is
a great way to express yourself and
something many Brompton residents
have given their seal of approval. An-
other really great investment that we
at Felix can’t get enough of is a roof.
Remember, your hair still grows after
you die and you certainly don’t want
it getting wet. A classic choice is the
mausoleum, a small house to keep
you nice and dry during those winter
months and really leave your mark on
the landscape.
Lastly we come to the tricky part-
what to write? his has to be the most
personal part of the grave experience
– just how can you leave that perfect
ﬁnal message to the world? Yes, you
could go it alone, but we at Felix have
some great tips to make your epitaph
an epictaph. Remember that the ideal
gravestone is a permanent business
card; you want to make sure that peo-
ple know just who’s worm-gobbled
remains they’re walking past. Include
any titles you may have like Sir, Lady
and so on. I saw one person in Bromp-
ton who went so far as to mention
their Oxford MA and the barrister
ﬁrm they worked for – take an up-to-
date CV to your local stone masons
and see what they can do with it.
Once you’ve made it clear just who
you were, how will you ﬁnd those
choice sentences that really encapsu-
late your life?
his could be quite a challenge but
luckily there’s a handy, one-size-ﬁts-
all solution to that: a bible quote. No-
body wants to run the risk of having
people disapprove of their choice of
epitaph. By choosing a quote from
the bible, even if you don’t believe in
it in the slightest, you shield yourself
from criticism and ensure you blend
in nicely with the other bible quotes
on your neighbours’ graves. Sorted.
So there’s my guide to How To Look
Good Dead, allowing you to remain
fashionable right up to the end and
beyond. By following these simple
rules you really can take all of the
hassle out of dying and ﬁnally begin
to look forward to it.
But let’s say, for the sake of argu-
ment, that there’s another approach
to death and another take on the
Brompton Cemetery. he stoneworks
today are giving way to the chisel-like
wind and rain of a century, the carved
statements of self-importance ren-
dered increasingly illegible with pass-
ing years. he cemetery remains, as
any other cemetery, a ﬁeld of buried,
indistinguishable skeletons; a con-
gress of ex-people. It was this truth
that, for me, held the real power of
the Brompton Cemetery. he utter
absurdity of so much of our existence
is laid out in its coarse, stone-carved
nudity. he gaping disconnect be-
tween the pompous monuments and
the anonymous skeletons beneath
them could well serve as a stark re-
ﬂection of our own lives. Our ob-
sessions with collecting accolades
and positions simply for keeping up
appearances seem just as foolish as
keeping a roof over our graves. What
use is there in limiting our existence
for the sake of the approval of others?
One thing I certainly can recommend
– next time you’re walking to College
and have some time on your hands,
get lost. You just might like it.
