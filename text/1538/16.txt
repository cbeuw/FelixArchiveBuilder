(science-related, obviously).
he pill has been letting
women grab life by the
balls instead of washing
those of unwanted chil-
dren for over 50 years.
Roughly 100 million women world-
wide take the pill and this has led to
improved quality of living across the
globe, huge reductions in numbers of
deaths during childbirth and an un-
derstandably massive decrease in the
number of unwanted pregnancies.
he pill acts by changing hormone
levels to trick the body into thinking
that it is already pregnant. his stops
eggs being released from ovaries and
leads to various gruesome sounding
things like increasing your cervical
mucus. he main aim is to make the
womb a pretty inhospitable place for
eggs.
So the pill has been having its way
with women’s wombs for a long time
and has played an important part in
allowing women to have better edu-
cations and explore further into the
working world. It’s unlikely that many
female CEOs and even Destiny’s
Child could have been such independ-
ent women if it weren’t for contracep-
tives like the pill.
However, along with these many
female-empowering outcomes of the
pill, there is evidence that the pill may
be altering other choices that females
make, including their choice of poten-
tial suitors and their sexual tendencies.
Normally, when women are not on
the pill, they experience alterations in
their mate preferences through their
menstrual cycle. Research has shown
that when women are ovulating, and
therefore fertile, they show a strong
preference for more masculine and
dominant men. Whereas when wom-
en are not fertile they shift their pref-
erence to more feminine ‘good father’
type men who can look after them
and provide them with resources, be
it sandwiches or diamonds. So these
changes in women’s instincts lead
to the exploitation of men for ei-
ther their potential to show-
er you with resources or
to provide their fan-
tastic genes.
his cycling has
been put down as
one of the key reasons
why women tend to cheat
more on their partners when
ovulating. Women also tend to
act in a more sexually promiscuous
way when ovulating, so single men of
Imperial, maybe it would be in your
beneﬁt to show some interest in the la-
dies’ menstrual cycles. However, these
women are generally going to be seri-
ously fertile, so kids... use protection.
Preference changes also occur in
men in response to ovulating women.
It has been shown that men are actu-
ally more attracted to women when
they are ovulating, be it because the
women are acting more conﬁdently
or that men are picking up on some
kind of pheromone-type signal. So,
what better way to test this idea than
send a load of awkward scientists to a
strip club? hey basically looked at fe-
male stripper wages throughout their
menstrual cycles and found that they
earned on average $150 more when
they were ovulating. his pretty ri-
diculous sounding fact is true; it’s been
proven using numerous beloved sta-
tistical techniques. herefore, I con-
clude that ovulation makes me (and
all you other women) $150 sexier. So
thank you to you ovulation for fuelling
t h a t questionably sexy dancing in
Metric for the many
years to come.
All this normal
cycling is altered
when women are on
the pill. Instead of hav-
ing a change in mate pref-
erence, women on the pill
are generally stuck in the ‘good
father’ preference. As women
don’t actually ovulate when on
the pill, the switch in preference to
dominant, sexy, genetically matched
men does not occur or does to a much
lesser extent.
he kinds of relationships that form
when women are on the pill there-
fore tend to be with ‘good father’ type
males. Questionnaires of these couples
showed that they actually tended to be
happier in their relationship and there-
fore they often lasted much longer
than couples that met when the wom-
an was not on the pill. However, a huge
majority of these couples stated that
they were disappointed with their sex
lives and weren’t really very attracted
to their partners.
here are even further issues. Say,
there is a lovely couple that got togeth-
er when the girl was on the pill. hey
go through life fulﬁlling numerous dat-
ing and romantic clichés until ﬁnally
he pops the question. What wonderful
news! NO. Following this apparent joy-
ous news the inevitable baby conversa-
tions are going to come up, and the de-
cision to come off the pill commences.
Problem 1: when women come off the
pill they show a strong preference for
the masculine, sexy male type. his is
not the type of man our scenario hus-
band is. his means that these kinds
of couples have an increased chance
of splitting up at this point when the
woman comes off the pill. Problem 2:
If the couple do stay together, ques-
tionnaires have shown that these cou-
ples are more dysfunctional, unhappy
and have unfulﬁlling sex lives. So your
options here are either, never have
children, stay on the pill forever and
continue with your lovely relationship,
stop taking the pill and break up with
partner or ﬁnally stay with your part-
ner and grow into an old bitter couple
that probably hate each other.

it. As more women are on the pill than
ever before, more woman are having
to face these potential situations, and
many are choosing to stay with their
“good father” partner and having their
children. hese men are not as well
matched genetically as those men they
would naturally chose to make babies
with and it has been suggested that this
may lead to some detrimental health
impacts in the future. Basically, those
men that are better matched geneti-
cally have more genetic dissimilarities,
particularly in term of genes involved
in immunity. herefore, if more wom-
en are having children with poor ge-
netically matched men, there are likely
going to be more children with worse
immune systems than if women were
picking men naturally without the pill’s
interference. his could mean more al-
lergy prone children and the potential
increase in for example, cases of asth-
ma. With the future for health looking
already increasingly bleak with ever
increasing waste lines and pint glasses,
the addition of more sickly children is
not ideal.
But please don’t worry, this is not the
case for every woman and these nega-
tive health effects aren’t predicted to be
severe. Also, if you did meet your part-
ner while on the pill, don’t panic! his
is not the case for everyone, you may
be the lucky exception.

It’s unlikely that...
even Destiny’s
Child could
have been such
independent
women if it
weren’t for
contraceptives
like the pill
H5N1- coming to a lab near

Michelle is struggling to remember the last
time she took her pill....
