Forget parchment in calf skin bind-
ing. Forget mock pine ﬁling cabinets
jammed with A4. Forget CDs, DVDs,
MP3s – in fact, forget all digital, da-
ta-storing acronyms.
A team of scientists has stored all
154 of Shakespeare's sonnets in DNA
– the Bard of Avon quickly turns in
his grave – along with 26 seconds
of Martin Luther King's "I have a
dream" speech, Watson and Crick's
paper on the structure of DNA, and
a photograph of the European Bio-
informatics Institute where the re-
search took place.
he ﬁndings, reported in Nature,
suggest that DNA is the perfect ar-
chive. Enormous data sets can be
stored concisely and accurately. If
maintained in cold, dry and dark en-
vironment, it could last for millen-
nia.
he team led by Nick Goldman
translated computer ﬁles into DNA
code, synthesised the DNA, se-
quenced it, and reconstructed the
ﬁles with 100 percent accuracy.
All the data was stored on 153,335
strings of DNA, each made up of 117
nucleotides.
Nick Goldman suggests that DNA
storage could be used in large-scale,
long-term projects, for example, at
CERN, the European nuclear re-
search centre in Geneva. Eighty
petabytes – that is 1 million giga-
bytes – of data about the Large Had-
ron Collider currently stored on disk
could be kept in a small amount of
DNA.
Technological advances are rapidly
reducing DNA synthesis costs, sug-
gesting this form of storage might be
with us sooner than we think.
Scientists have considered storing
data in live vectors, such as bacte-
ria. But mutations might change the
text over time and storage conditions
would have to be carefully regulat-
ed. And perhaps the idea is just too
strange: Martin Luther King, more
than forty-ﬁve years after his assassi-
nation, living on in a bacterial smear.
Shakespeare's Sonnet 55 begins:
Not marble, nor the gilded monu-
ments of princes, shall outlive this
powerful rhyme... A statement that
appears eerily true.

ith great
p o w e r
comes great
re sp onsi-
bility,” one
wise man once said. Although he was
unknowingly hinting at those with
super powers to tread carefully, it too
can be applied in the wider context to
those that have the capacity to seri-
ously aﬀect people, either for good
or bad. Right now, scientists are the
super heroes of the real world (that
includes you, so feel free to give your-
self a pat on the back right now. Yes,
even if you are alone in the Library
Café), and with technology acceler-
ating at metaphorical speeds to the
point where we had to even redeﬁne
the greatest literal speed, great re-
sponsibility needs to come into play
too.
Virologists are such people who
have been treading carefully as of
late. Last year they imposed upon
themselves a moratorium to halt in-
vestigations into the avian H5N1 vi-
rus – a strain of inﬂuenza that is gain-
ing momentum in infection, both in
humans and birds, and which could
lead to the next pandemic.
Research was initially put on a 60
day hiatus in January 2012 to discuss
the biosecurity hazards of the investi-
gations into H5N1. his was sparked
by the attempt to publish previous re-
search covering the mutations need-
ed for the virus to allow transmission
between ferrets and that could pos-
sibly allow for human transmission
too. Researchers reasoned that such
mutations could just as easily occur in
nature, and ignorance will deﬁnitely
not lead to bliss if we just turn a blind
eye. It is better knowing the capac-
ity of the virus and being able to plan
for a possible pandemic than feeling
threatened by the hazards posed by
carrying out such research in the ﬁrst
place, the scientists reasoned.
However, people who opposed this
included the National Scientiﬁc Ad-
visory Board for Biosecurity sector
of the American government, who
feared that without censoring the pa-
pers, such data could be misused by
small labs that could lead to an out-
break of an artiﬁcially manufactured,
dangerous strain of the pathogen. So
despite research picking up consider-
able speed, the hiatus was introduced.
his “60 day” period halted as of
last week however, and a letter from
key researchers in the ﬁeld conﬁrmed
that with the WHO, among others,
issuing rules concerning biosafety,
biosecurity and communication, in-
vestigations will now proceed. Gov-
ernments and institutions need to
approve research before it is taken
any further, and a biosafety level of
3 or higher in labs is suggested as
necessary for the work. With level 4
being the highest and necessary for
investigations into pathogens such as
Ebola, another virus whose infection
is lethal and currently has no cure,
level 3 for a virus with a lethality that
is considerably less was considered
appropriate.
However, how careful is too care-
ful? “Scientiﬁc curiosity,” for want of
a better phrase, has never been one
to carefully toe the line between what
is needed for scientiﬁc advancement
and the relative views of the general
public. Safety concerns, moral con-
ﬂicts and technological constraints
have all been known to hinder re-
search, and it is how researchers con-
duct themselves when overcoming
these barriers, and the responsibility
they exhibit, that can add, or dimin-
ish considerable value to the papers
that they then publish.
Often, a balance has to be struck,
and this may be an example of when
the balance was just about right. he
introduced safety measures may limit
the lab numbers that can investigate
H5N1, but at least the labs that will
be able to will do so without danger
to themselves and others. Advance-
ment speed may be stiﬂed, but at
least measures like these may stop sil-
ly journalists wandering into labs and
getting bit by whatever research is on
show at the time. Because as much as
we might like it, there are not enough
Uncle Bens in the world to simply
state that with “Great power comes
great responsibility,” and hope that
that alone does the job.
