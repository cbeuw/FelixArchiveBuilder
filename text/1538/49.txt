FRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY
50
Gosh, that’s so, awkward...
Got a photo of someone being a waste of a student loan?
Get permission, then just send it to us at: felix@imperial.ac.uk
Farting (especially when it’s
in public places)
Oh come on, everyone does it. It’s just
kind of satisfying to think you got
away with. Most women pretend that
they go to a secret place to fart, most
men assume it’s somehow masculine.
If methane gas gently cascading from
your bum is masculine, then cows are
a regular 300 style beefcake.
Get into a situation where
it’s one on one with someone
you really want to get with,
but be too overwhelmed to
say anything
Some classic Imperial awkwardness
here. You’ve done it. Either you’ve en-
gineered (or through luck ﬁnd your-
self in) a situation where it’s just you
and them. Right. Now is the opportu-
nity to lay down some “mad seduction
skillz” and show them how amazing
you are. Oh, wait, hang on. What the
fuck should I say. It’s now been a good,
solid few seconds of silence and is
deﬁnitely getting awks now. Oh, okay,
just reference something that you’ve
compiled from knowledge of Face-
book. “I’ve seen you’ve been to Egypt”.
Hmmm, may be creepy as then they’ll
know you’ve looked at all the beach
shots. Harmlessly name drop that you
really like that band that they like.
“Oh, I really like Sum 41”... As soon as
you utter any words, you remember
that all music/TV/ﬁlm pages people
have on their proﬁle is from about ﬁve
years ago and you now just look like
you’ve been living under a rock for the
last few years.
hey make an excuse and leave. Sigh.
Thought you were being
funny, cool and a complete
badass while drunk, but
actually just being a bit of a
dick
What? Chanting on the night bus isn’t
exactly Bruce Wayne heroics.
Been caught exaggerating a
story from a night out..
Typical conversation:
You: Yeah, and we must have done,
like, about, 10 shots.
Someone you know: Erm, yeah, I
don’t remember hanging out with you
much.
hird person in the conversation that
you were trying to impress: Right, I’m
going to go back to my problem sheet
(while secretly noting down to never
believe any story you ever tell them).
You: I guess it was more like two, over
the space of three hours. Still. It was
crazy.
Taken a massive dump
Everybody poops. Bears partake in
this activity in a woodland area. For
some reason, however, it’s still social-
ly unnacceptable to do so at a house
party and/or a night club. Next time
you’re at either, take a stand: go to the
toilet – leaving the door proudly open
– and loudly grunt and moan while
relieving yourself. For added eﬀect,
play a quick game of Doodlejump
on the iPhone (for bonus points steal
someone else’s iPhone). here. Stigma
gone. Plus (just for the guys) let’s see
someone say “no spray no lay” to you
now that they’ve seen that. hey’ll
have to invent new rhymes just to deal
with you.
Talk to yourself
Yep. You give pep talks before exams.
Mutter “what the fuck?” during, think
“I wish I just did Art History or some
other waste subject at UCL” out loud
in the Library. Once, at least, you’ll
get caught by someone who will give
you a look. It’s okay. I’m sure that im-
mediately looking down and starting
to hum, followed by some looking
around and saying “ah, shit, yeah,
need to remember to call them up to-
night for the massive rave we’re going
to” will fool them. hey’ll think that
the talking to yourself is actually just
because you’re just that cool that you
need to say things to remember all the
amazing parties you’ll be attending.
Read the Daily Mail’s side-
bar of shame, unironically
It’s just really, really interesting to
know exactly what someone you’ve
barely heard of is doing on a Friday.
Rap lyrics of
the week
“Yeah I’m on camera, fresh out of a
sex scene,
I just turn all my nightmares into
wet dreams”
So, you’re a porn star I guess? Or
just a movie star that has done a
sex scene, and thought that they
should then tell everyone about it
immediately after. That’s not lame
“hey guys, I got to be in sex scene
today, that’s so cool”.
What’s weird though is that your
nightmares must have been some-
how sex related to turn them into
wet dreams. Also, wet dreams oc-
cur when you are not having a lot
of sex/not wanking. That means
you must not be getting laid at all,
which completely debunks the
idea that you’re “fresh out of a sex
scene” unless you didn’t cum in
that scene. In that case, perhaps
you have a really ugly face that
you make, which the director is
just not willing to show others. Or,
perhaps, you’re just not getting
any. Probably because referring
to yourself as “Big Sean” is kind of
douchey. Plus, as rap names go, us-
ing your real name isn’t inventive.
Big Sean: “High”
“She made us drinks, to drink, we
drunk them, got drunk.
And I think, she thinks, I’m cool”
First of all, thank you very much
for explaining how the intoxica-
tion process works. So, you drink
drinks and get drunk. Plus “I think,
she thinks, I’m cool” is probably
the least cool thing to think. If she
knewthatthenshewoulddefinite-
ly not think that you are cool. She
would think that you are a bit lame
and have a filthy search history.
T-Pain: “Bartender”
A non comprehensive (as that’s for dickheads) list of embarrassing things that
you do, pretty much all of the time
