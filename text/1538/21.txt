FRIDAY 01 FRIDAY
o, imagine you’re at a party
with all the UK’s univer-
sities. Standing in a cor-
ner are the Russell Group,
stroking their rugby team
ties and snubbing the rest of the unis,
who are actually having fun. Out in the
hallway are a bunch of businessmen in
a circle, all jacking oﬀ onto Imperial,
who willingly kneels in the middle.
hey’re jizzing job oﬀers or some-
thing – don’t read too much into this
metaphor, it’s just meant to show a
point: Imperial isn’t enjoying the party
or talking to the other universities at
all, but is at the centre of its own busi-
ness bukkake. Imperial is isolated in
a way like no other uni, and this isn’t
helping us (in fact, it makes us the
creepy guy who’s probably going to go
postal).
I should have seen the warning signs
when, during application, I found out
that we’re no longer a member of the
University of London nor are we in the
NUS. We don’t even get the London
Student on campus. All of these lead to
one thing: a university that has no con-
nection to the country’s student body,
Isolated Imperial
Catina Willows
or even to the rest of London.
Paul Beaumont’s recent comment,
– “[the NUS] little reﬂects the needs
and wants of the ‘top end’” just seem
to scream like a little spoilt brat, “but
we’re better than everyone else!” espe-
cially when all other unis at the top end
are in the NUS. Our Union willingly
and arrogantly puts us in a class above
every other university, and like the
spoilt brat, no one wants to play with
us. I mean, our varsity game is against
ourselves – that’s sad, Imperial. Really
fucking sad.
his has some real implications, too:
sure, our research and graduate employ-
ment might be top, but what about the
student experience? here’s so many op-
portunities we’re missing out on and I’m
sure this is just one of the many things
contributing to our abysmal student sat-
isfaction rating.
he Imperial attitude is warped by our
exclusionism, too. Look at the amount
of hate the Feminist Society here has
been getting (of which I’m not a member
– though this may come as a shock to
commenters on my previous article) just
for daring to exist. Other universities
have had feminist or women’s societies
for years. hey’re a normal thing, though
most Imperial students would never be-
lieve that. I’ve even heard of a feminist
magazine – Cuntry Life – at Oxford.
Oxford! It’s a really worrying sign when
we’re winning at conservatism against
the country’s oldest university.
“Imperial apathy” is talked about
a lot, and that’s just another sign of
this. No wonder we’re not going to
protests or being active in politics if
we have no idea what’s going on. So,
students, Paul, Union, please: let’s do
something about this. Voting yes to
joining the NUS would be a great step,
but maybe as a start we could say hello
to our neighbours on the other side of
London, or they’re gonna forget that
we exist.

erhaps, everybody has
Murphy in their life. Per-
haps, many just do not
notice it. Being a sensi-
tive over thinker, I am
always a little bit too aware of Mur-
phy and his quirky laws. Basically, the
theory goes that anything that can go
wrong will go wrong.
Murphy always seemed to be in the
picture, and I would worry non-stop
about what could go wrong, what will
go wrong and how to deal with it when
it does go wrong. A while back, I had
to be responsible and sensible, strong
enough to restrain and calm a very ill
person, alongside attempting to pre-
dict and prevent all the ways that there
would be evil in the world as a child.
Yet, trying to be balanced enough to
contemplate the arguments with my
foster mum, on one important bit
about the universe or the other and
being told otherwise.
I’ll just pause here for a second.
What about you? Just think of eve-
rything that has gone wrong in your
life. On second thoughts, don’t. hink
about everything in your life that has
been a lesson. It’s strange right.
How do you feel with a saying from
an Eastern Sage, who said “Why do
Over-analysing - an Imperial tradition
P
Anum Farooq takes a positive view of life
you complain of the rub, that polishes
you, my friend?’ Could it be that Mr
Murphy is just a theoretical concept is
inadvertently helping us become bet-
ter people, in a transient life.
I don’t know how it happened, or
the moment when the weight from
my shoulders was lifted and it felt like
I could see clearly in the mist of real-
ity. Occam’s razor (from my limited
understanding) is the concept that in
essence does not seek a complicated
explanation, but gets rid of the un-
necessary, and holds true to the most
straightforward way of explaining
things.
Don’t you see? Most people push
away happiness but subconsciously
hold onto it. What we don’t real-
ize that happiness is here. Happiness
is past, present and future, towards
a tranquil horizon. A butterﬂy that
comes and quietly sits by the shoulder,
when we become too large for worry,
too loyal for ﬁckleness, too humble
for arrogance, too funny for anger,
too selﬂess for avarice, too brave to
be to be inﬂuenced and too kind for
jealousy.
One day I ran in the ﬁelds, and sat
on branches that swayed in the wind,
with the leaves a kaleidoscope of sun-
light and green. I learnt that peace in all
its deﬁnitions is a simple explanation
for the inner soul, and the outer world.
Find your path. Try to simplify life,
ﬁnd the simplest explanation and the
most positive. It will make a world of
diﬀerence. You have far more impor-
tant and beautiful days to be dazed by
challenges and miracles.
Define what is important, let go
of the unnecessary. Think for your-
self and simplify everything, under-
stand the core. To see the translu-
cent and most positive, to see good
in all and to believe that yesterday,
today and tomorrow are simply the
best days, is a little philosophy that
leads to nothing going wrong and
everything going right.
This is the only
picture we could
find for “isolation”
