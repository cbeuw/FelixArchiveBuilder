Imperial have launched an anonymous
survey to help to develop an Educa-
tion and Student Strategy. he website
consists of a questionnaire with all
open text responses for students and
staﬀ to ﬁll out with their thoughts on
the education and student experience.
he survey is behind a log in wall, but
is going to be anonymous, unless stu-
dents wish to be credited with their
suggestions. he survey is open to
all members of the College commu-
nity and will be open until Tuesday
19 February. here will be two open
meetings, which all students and staﬀ
can attend, at 13:00-14:00 Wednesday
6 February and 17:00-18:00 hursday
14 February in the Pippard Lecture
heatre in Sherﬁeld.
he survey is split up into four ‘stra-
tegic objectives’. Each one relates to
the educational and student experi-
ence at Imperial. here are examples
that are deemed useful from other in-
stitutions around the world and data
from within College is provided next
to the question. hese is also a box at
the bottom of the page for further sug-
gestions, and students and staﬀ can
complete as much or as little as they
wish to. here is also a hashtag #im-
pcoled for people to share their ideas
via Twitter.
Championing the survey is the Pro-
Rector (Education) Debra Humphris,
who will be sorting through the re-
sponses to produce a ‘green paper’,
which will be further streamlined into
a ‘white paper’. his will be the docu-
ment that contains the Education and
Student Strategy, and will be taken
to the relevant boards (Management
Board and College Council) for review
and to start putting it into practice.
his white paper will be the imple-
mentation plan, which will be taken to
the Management Board for considera-
tion in June of this year. Speaking of
the survey, Humphris said: “Every co-

hort of Imperial students leaves an im-
print on the College. We hope part of
the current generation’s legacy will be
to help shape the experience of their
successors, by sharing their views and
opinions with us in this process.”
Paul Beaumont, Union President,
urged students to ﬁll out the survey
by saying that “nothing is more pow-
erful in eﬀecting change than a
