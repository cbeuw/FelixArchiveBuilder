Previous and Forthcoming Events
RichardMurphyontheCorporateTaxScandal:ThinkingwithPortals
Yaqub Chaudharyletsyouknowwhattheyhavecomingupthisterm
ast term the Political Phi-
losophy Society invited
Richard Murphy to speak
about the furore amongst
the public, media and poli-
ticians that arose as a reaction to news
of the tax aﬀairs of major corpora-
tions.
As a chartered accountant and
economist, Richard Murphy, a found-
er of the Tax Justice Network and
director of Tax Research, has been
an instrumental ﬁgure in bringing to
light almost every major corporate tax
story at present and is a regular com-
mentator in print and on the radio. He
is also a proliﬁc writer on his web log
at taxresearch.org.uk.
he seminar was organised at the
height of the scandal with new stories
being released daily. he very week the
seminar was organised, Bloomberg
uncovered that Google avoided $2bn
in worldwide taxes by moving $10bn
to a Bermuda based entity. In addition
to this, the Sunday Independent in Ire-
land found Google paid only 0.14%
tax on sales of $62bn in seven years.
Other companies implicated in this
brazen circumvention of taxation in-
clude Starbucks with sales of £3bn
in 14 years which paid only £8.6m in
corporation tax and Amazon with UK
sales of £3.35bn in 2011 which only re-
ported £1.8m in tax expenses.
he companies would all insist on
full compliance with the laws through
ﬁnancial advice from the “Big Four”
accounting ﬁrms. he response of
Eric Schmidt, Google Chairman, was
unapologetic saying that the company
was proudly capitalistic and paid taxes
in “legally prescribed ways”. Yet nu-
merous MPs and commentators con-
demned these practices on the basis
of morality. For example, Margaret
Hodge of the public accounts com-
mittee said quite clearly, “We’re not
accusing you of being illegal, we are
accusing you of being immoral.”
hus Richard Murphy was asked to
address whether this really is a ques-
tion of morality. Has Google been
breaking its motto of “Don’t be evil”?
A full recording of the event is now
available on the Political Philosophy
website in which he begins by dis-
cussing why this is a signiﬁcant issue
now and the scale of the “tax gap” in
relation to the UK deﬁcit. He then ad-
dresses the question of legality and
how companies avoid tax by under-
mining rules to prevent double taxa-
tion and ﬁnally, he presents his argu-
ment on why aggressive tax avoidance
is unethical by considering the nature
of the state and the power of legisla-
tion in enforcing property rights and
the right to tax.
he next Political Philosophy So-
ciety event will be on hursday 7th
February at 6:30pm in RSM LTG20
on “he Future of Money”. A panel
of invited speakers will discuss fu-
ture money systems that may emerge
in the midst of widespread ﬁnancial
crises and with the vast proliferation
of digital technology. For example,
will our fundamental conception of
money be altered by the emergence of
virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and
as more transactions are completed
electronically? Or will it
be necessary to return to
a money system based on
the gold standard?
he three invited
speakers are Detlev
Schlichter (Economist
and author of Paper
Money Collapse – he
Folly of Elastic Money
and the Coming Mon-
etary Breakdown), Tarek
El Diwany (writer and
consultant in Islamic
banking and ﬁnance and
a senior partner at Zest
Advisory LLP) and Amir
Taaki (Bitcoin project
developer and Chairman
of the Bitcoin Consul-
tancy).
he PPS exists as a forum
for discussion on a broad
range of political and
philosophical matters.
Its aim is to encourage
debate and discussion on
campus that will lead to
a better understanding of
the world in general. It is
a student led society and
participation is very wel-
come. If you are interested
in joining the committee
or participating in some
other way then please
