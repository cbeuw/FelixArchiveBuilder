Looking into the gender balance
ale undergraduates
continue to out-
number females by
nearly two to one
as revealed by the
College Strategic Planning Division.
Felix tries to make sense of it all.
he (unsurprising) revelation came
to light after the department revealed
that for the previous academic year
a mere 3,116 undergraduates out of
9,080 were female. Some postulate
that this is a particular facet of Impe-
rial College but research into other
UK universities, conducted by Fe-
lix, reveals otherwise. he statistics
highlight a strong aﬃnity of the male
population with STEM (Science, Tech-
nology, Engineering & Mathematics)
subjects.
United Kingdom Statistics
‘Oxbridge’, Durham University and
University College London exhibit
more balanced male: female ratios,
with the latter having a 2% female ma-
jority overall. Delving deeper into the
statistics shows a pivotal change in
the ratio for the STEM subjects. he
University of Oxford shows that male
undergraduates outweigh their female
counterparts by a sizeable 22%. Build-
ing upon this a mere 33.4% of science
undergraduates at the University of
Cambridge enrolled for equivalent
2011/2012 academic year were female.
he trend for Durham was less po-
larised but reiterated the correlation.
Taken with a pinch of salt these ﬁnd-
ings demonstrate that the phenom-
enon is far from localised to Imperial
College (being a focus for higher tech-
nical education alone), which instead
reﬂects a more generalised third level
STEM trend otherwise obscured in
different institutions by humanities
departments.
Global Statistics
Further investigation conducted by
Felix presented the observed male: fe-
male ratios as a global trend, extend-
ing into Europe, the United States of
America and the Far East. Starting off
in close proximity to the UK (and clos-
er to my heart – Eoghan) the skewed
ratio is observed in Dublin institutions.
Out of the 11,844 undergraduates en-
rolled at Trinity College Dublin for the
2010/2011 academic year 4,856 (41%)
were male. On the contrary this does
not extend to any of the niche STEM
disciplines. he starkest contrast to the
college-wide ratio arises within heo-
retical Physics; one in thirty scholars
are said to be female.
At Princeton University, an ar-
chetype of the widely renowned Ivy
League, data for the 2011/2012 semes-
ters revealed a 51:49 male: female ratio.
he Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, rather surprisingly, exhibited
a similar overall ratio. In spite of this
a 2008 study co-ordinated by Michael
McGrew-Hardeg, executive editor of
he Tech, the leading MIT newspaper,
presented profound deviation within
certain STEM disciplines. While a
staggering 75% of Brain and Cognitive
Scientists were revealed to be women
they only occupied a third of the avail-
able spots in Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science, alleged to be
the most competitive course at MIT.
One in four Nuclear Science and En-
gineering undergraduates were female.
Addressing Asian student trends a
minimal 2,543 out of 13,887 under-
graduates at the University of Tokyo
were female as of May 1st 2011. his
may reﬂect an extensively developed
Japanese economy renowned for being
centred on the technocrat. he most
polarised of all Universities is, in fact,
in Europe. Technische Universiteit
Delft in Holland once supported a
whopping 80:20 male: female majority!
Possible Reasons for Extreme
Male:Female Polarisation
he data is overwhelming and per-
sistent. he Imperial College gender
ratio has remained approximately un-
changed over the previously elapsed
decade… but why? he trend extends
far beyond third level education and
deep into the world of work, despite
the efforts of organisations such as
WISE (Women in Science, Engineer-
ing and Construction), who aspire to
achieve a 30% employment rate in the
aforementioned STEM ﬁelds by 2020.
One might argue that this target is
somewhat tame; it even suggests a feel-
ing of hesitancy on the part of WISE.
his is diﬃcult to rationalise when
one considers the driven work ethic
of so many women at Imperial Col-
lege (indeed frequently more driven
than many male students). It could be
considered a wider pressing, societal
problem that requires urgent address.
Some argue the phenomenon to
be a simultaneously global and cul-
tural legacy from a bygone era, when
We all know about the infamous ‘ratio’ at Imperial. Is it about the
STEM subjects, just Imperial, or a worldwide issue? Matt Proctor
and Eoghan J Totten investigate
M
previously and unfairly subjected.
In spite of this many believe that
such bias cannot persevere in the
modern world and look towards other
possibilities. Nature versus nurture has
often been cited, the trend of discourse
moving towards the latter in recent
times. It may be that the signiﬁcant
female depletion in STEM university
subjects has its origins in early school-
ing, education and other childhood
inﬂuences. Boys and girls, rightly or
wrongly, are frequently encouraged
in differing manners, with the former
being directed towards scientiﬁc dis-
ciplines. It may be that this initiates a
negative feedback that extends right
through to third level education. he
problem may simply be a product of
nurture. Addressing this fundamental
societal ﬂaw may begin a process of
resolution.
Laura Johnston, WSET Chair, was
asked for comment. She said that the
ﬁgures “suggest it’s a country wide
problem and that more efforts should
be made to encourage girls to persue
STEM subjects at degree level overall.
Only then will Imperial start to see a
proper balance. However, this doesn’t
explain the lack of females in more
advanced positions within Imperial,
eg. PhD students and lecturers, as the
ratio of men to women becomes more
extreme the higher you go.”
Speculation on the issue need not
have an end without wider discussion,
thus Felix invites the undergraduate
readers (particularly female!) to have
their say. Find this article on felixon-
line.co.uk/ and voice your thoughts on
the following pressing issues:
• Why does female depletion in
STEM disciplines continue to prevail?
• What might be a solution to rem-
edy the gender imbalance?

Male to Female Ratio - Undergraduates
all forms of education and employ-
ment (not just STEM disciplines) were
male-dominated. While it may indeed
be controversial to invoke such a pos-
sibility of prejudice in a politically cor-
rect modern world there is evidence to
suggest that it may at least in part be
a contributory factor. In a paper pro-
duced by PNAS (Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, USA) it
was deduced that in research-intensive
Universities: “Faculty participants rat-
ed the male applicant as signiﬁcantly
more competent and hireable than the
(identical) female applicant”. his was
bolstered by a study undertaken by
Yale University which concluded that
science professors frequently “regard
female undergraduates as less compe-
tent than male students with the same
accomplishments and skills”. It may be
that these ﬁndings are categorical and
possibly damaging generalisations of a
more intricate problem, yet there may
be some truth in it.
Male:female postgraduate statistics
at Imperial College are closer to 60:40
as revealed by the Strategic Planning
Division. Some might argue that the
older, more qualiﬁed woman is viewed
more favourably by selection commit-
tees, shaking herself free of any stigma-
tisation to which she may have been
