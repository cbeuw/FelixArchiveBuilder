Newcomers to the college are often
surprised to learn that Imperial has
a non-scientific library. In fact, a
general cultural collection has
existed in some shape or form since
around the time that H . G . Wells
urged students to 'show that they
were not barbarians'. T h e present
Haldane Library is named after R
B Haldane, politician, Renaissance
man, and an instigator of the merger
of IC's constituent colleges. The
Haldane Library has the dual
function of providing a wide range
of general reading for all members
of the College, and supporting the
teaching and other activities of the
Humanities programme.
The Haldane Library is situated
on Level 2 of the Central Libraries
and is accessible from the entrance
opposite the Queen's Tower from
9.30am to 9.00pm on Mondays to
Fridays (9.30am to 5.30pm on
Saturdays) and from the Level 2
entrance between 11.00am and
4.00pm on Mondays to Fridays
during term (vacation hours are
shorter). T h e l i b r a r y c a r d ,
obtainable from the registration
desk on Level 1 of the library,
permits the borrowing of up to four
books (including maps and music
scores), two records or cassettes (or
one of each), and 2 compact discs.
For C D s a contribution of 50p per
issues is requested; this is to provide
for further purchases and security
in the collection, which was set up
by means of grants and voluntary
contributions. B o o k s may be
borrowed for one term, and are
issued from the main issue counter
on Level 1. Sound recordings are
issued for three weeks from the
sound recordings issue desk in the
Haldane Library itself. The M u s i c
Library (books, periodicals, music
scores and sound recordings) is
currently open from 11,00am to
4.00pm, Monday to Friday, but it
is hoped that these hours will be
extended during the course of
session 1991-92.
The Haldane Library aims to
cater for all tastes and it would be
impossible to describe its contents
exhaustively. Most conspicuous are
such subjects as politics, history,
travel, biography, m u s i c , art
history, philosophy, and literature,
but there is much more besides.
There are, for example, well-used
sections on consumer matters,
sport, g e n e o l o g y , t r a n s p o r t ,
feminism, religion and humour.
Beyond this it is well worth a
browse to discover some of the
curiositites, which, quite apart from
the fringes of psychology, range
from giants to Egyptian grammar.
T h e most requested authors this
year have included Nostradamus, as
well as, more predictably, Umberto
E c o and T o m W o l f e . T w o

collections of particular significance
are fiction and popular music
recordings, both of which are
financed by the Students' Union and
selected by student buyers. T h e
Music Library houses printed music
(including a good selection of
chamber music parts), language
cassettes, some spoken word
recordings in addition to the
classical and popular recordings
already mentioned.
Daily newspapers (the Times, the
Financial Times, the Guardian, the
Independent and the Daily
Telegraph) are taken, as well as a
wide range of magazines and
periodicals (including Autocar and
Motor, Private Eye, New Left
Review, Newsweek, Great
Outdoors, Britain Events and
Which), some of them financed by
the U n i o n . Some subscriptions
support taught courses, notably
history periodicals, Stern and
L'Express. There are Ordnance
Survey and other maps, atlases, and
a good reference collection. In
addition, the library receives a
selection of publicity material of
theatres, concerts, and other events
in London. T h e library also hosts
occasional poetry readings.
It remains to say that we welcome
new users and are always glad to
consider suggestions for new
purchases and to forward requests
for new fiction titles and popular
sound recordings to the U n i o n
buyers, who are still to be appointed
for this year. The Haldane Library
staff are Janet Smith, Haldane
Librarian; Jane A g n e w , Senior
Assistant; and a half-time M u s i c
A s s i s t a n t w h o is yet to be
appointed. W e look forward to
meeting you!
