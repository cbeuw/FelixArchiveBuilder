It has been a m a n i c week. I have
had so much caffeine pumped into
my system that I have been buzzing
near the ceiling most of the time.
A l l these f r e s h - f a c e d and
enthusiastic first years have given
me intimations of mortality and
made me feel very old. A l l in all it
has been an emotionally as well as
physically and mentally draining
week.
T h e Sports C e n t r e
This looks like it is going to become
the first cause celebre of the
academic year. This issue contains
a news story on the subject, and I
have already received two letters
against the proposed changes and a
promise of one from V a l Straw, of
College Estates, saying what a good
idea they are. None of these reached
Felix in time for inclusion (deadline
- M o n d a y lunchtime), but they will
go in next week's. It is true that the
Sports Centre is, at best, rather
spartan. Unfortunately a vast
investment such as the one proposed
inevitably means that prices for
students will go up. I believe that
most students would prefer a basic
sports centre they could afford
rather than a plush one that they
could not. If student prices do not
go up then their access will be
increasingly limited a l l o w i n g
outside people to use the facility
originally intended for the students
and staff of Imperial.
Having attended an Athletic
Clubs Committee meeting in which
the subject was raised, it has
become clear that students simply
do not trust that the progenitors of
this scheme have students' interests
at heart. I do not think this is unduly
cynical - very few of college's
money spinning ideas ever do. In
fact it was unanimously agreed that
the proposed changes were bad, and
a number of individuals commented
that the College was less than
wholly frank and open on the entire
subject. The concensus was that all
the clubs that use the facilities are
seriously pissed off about the
change in prices, arrangements and
times of access, so annoyed in fact
that they are going to do something
about it. This is a rare occurrence
at Imperial - things have to be
seriously bad for students to start
doing something to rectify the
situation
There is a rather strange circular
a r g u m e n t b e i n g p r o p o u n d e d
concerning the reason for the face
lift. T o wit, better facilities are
necessary to attract external sporty
types, which presumably are
needed to finance the building of the
better facilities. Zoe Hellinger has
said that if the Sports Centre intends
to try to dig into Harlington Trust
funds, the U n i o n will strongly
contest it. Students will have to pay
for these facilities through increased
prices and restricted access. I fail
to see the benefit for students since
they do not require Jacuzzis, saunas,
sunbeds and extra cafes. That part
of the college is very well endowed
with place to buy food and drink,
and most of the luxury 'health spa'
bits can be found at the University
of London U n i o n . In any case very
few students are going to have the
time to lay for hours in a sunbed,
and those who find a warmish
shower a luxury are unlikely to fork
out for a Jacuzzi. A cleaner facility
would be nice, though.
In conclusion, short of more

evidence that the changes are going
to help Imperial students, I cannot
see the Union, including Felix,
supporting the scheme. Despite
what the various managers of
Sherfield and the Sports Centre say,
the facility is the Imperial College
Sports Centre, not the 'Imperial' or
'South Kensington' Sports Centre.
T h e former is M r Coleman's
p r e f e r e n c e , the latter. M r
Marshall's.

One of the biggest events that the
Union puts on each year is the
Career's Fair. This year it will be
held on the Queen's Lawn in a
marquee on Tuesday 15th and
Wednesday 16th October. Over 60
British and international companies
will be attending, and final year
students should pay a visit.
In this time of recession any
opportunity of finding a job ought
to be snapped up - even those not
in their final year should have a
snoop.
Staff M e e t i n g
A l l those interested in Felix should
come along today (Friday) at
1.00pm for a staff meeting. I am
open to suggestions as to how Felix
should look, what its content should
be and who wants to get involved
in what. A l s o , it would be a fine
time to show all the new people the
ropes.
