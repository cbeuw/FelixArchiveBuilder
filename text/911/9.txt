Southwell's Shame
Dear Felix,
A s the committee o f Southwell
Hall, we are writing to you in order
to express our concern at the current
condition of this Hall. Last year our
c o n c e r n s were c o u n t e r e d b y
promises o f swift action and
maintenance over the summer
break. None of these promises were
honoured. This has resulted in a
further decline in the state o f the
hall despite an increase in the rent
for a single room.
We arrived in hall a week early
in order to prepare for the arrival
of the new residents. Traditionally
this has involved moving and
rearranging furniture, both i n
rooms and the communal areas.
However, this year we have spent
approximately 2 5 0 m a n hours
engaged in these activities as well
Trust
Hal Hartley with Trust has yet again
proven, on a shoestring budget, his
ability to make us laugh at even the
darkest subjects. His second attempt
proves that his first film, The
Unbelievable Truth, was not just a
one-time thing but an intimation of
things yet to come.
Trust is about two people helping
each other realise that the
stereotypes imposed on them are
not necessarily who they are and the
transformation that takes place in
the process. T h e issues touched
upon by Hartley such as child abuse
and alcoholism never become
overemphasised. H e retains this
light-handed attitude with snappy
dialogue and a bit o f surrealism.
(Now really, w h o would carry a
live hand grenade just in case he
decided to commit suicide or blow
up a building?) That's part o f the
charm o f this movie; slight quirks
keep the film just off-balance
enough for us to laugh in the middle
of an abortion scene and not feel
guilty about it later.
Matthew Slaughter, the lead
played by Martin Donovan, is
desperately trying to retain his
as reporting defects, cleaning out
rubbish, m e n d i n g l o c k s , a n d
repairing furniture. This figure does
not include work done by the
wardens, subwardens, and college
maintenance men and cleaners.
During this time 118 minor defects
(requiring less than 15 minutes to
repair) and 19 major defects
(requiring hours to days to repair)
of an essential nature were reported.
This excludes major faults such as
water hammer (?—Rose), holes and
cracks in walls, peeling paint, and
s h o d d y f u r n i t u r e . T h e t w o
maintenance men employed by
college to look after all the 650 +
rooms in Evelyn Gardens have been
w o r k i n g e x t r e m e l y h a r d .
Unfortunately, there are simply not
enough of them for the task in hand.
There are three particular points
integrity in a world of business that
cares more about quotas than
quality. E v e n here Hartley does not
sermonise on the cold cruelty of big
business. Rather, we laugh at
Matthew's way of dealing with it -
putting his supervisor's head in a
vise, for example. By doing this we
don't feel like we've spent two
hours in a cinema being imprinted
with 'messages' and have a good
time instead.
Adrienne Shelley plays his young
lover. Shelley lends just enough
wide- eyed innocence to her part of
M a r i a - the 17-year old drop-out
pregnant slut - that we have little
d i f f i c u l t y b e l i e v i n g i n h e r
transformation to a bookish pseudo-
intellectual with the help o f
Matthew. Martin Donovan exudes
such charm on-screen that for
anyone not to fall in love with him
would be hard - let alone an
insecure girl like her. The island
these two characters create for
themselves in a world gone mad on
reality gives us just enough hope for
humanity yet.
If you've ever wanted to laugh at
A m e r i c a n s u b u r b i a a n d the
ridiculous stereotypes perpetuated
by this subculture - go see this
movie. Hell - even i f you haven't
- see Trust f o r the sincere
enjoyment o f the madness created
in what we call the 'real world'.

which we would like to make.
Firstly, Southwell is a self-catering
hall. Currently there is: one
microwave per 45 residents; one
oven for 28 residents; and one
working cooker element for five
residents. Secondly, the rain over
the last weekend resulted in three
new leaks. W e expect one to three
further leaks every time we
experience a major rainstorm.
Finally, three years ago when
Southwell and M i n i n g Houses were
amalgamated into Southwell Hall,
college promised an upgrade for the
entire hall. T h i s has yet to
materialise. W e could continue, but
we believe that we have made our
point.
W e were all extremely concerned
about the reactions o f the new
residents and their parents. It was
being shown at the I C A . Red &
Rosy is a comic documentary about
drag racer Richard ' B i g R e d '
Friedman. After a near fatal crash,
he emerges from 32 hours o f
surgery with an insatiable addiction
to adrenaline - other people's. H e
still goes on to marry gorgeous
Drag Queen, Rosy, whose scrap
metal e m p i r e p r o v i d e s h i s
adrenaline powered drag simulator.
Together they continue to lure
terrified victims to fuel their
addiction, unaware o f the terrible
physiological consequences o f
adrenaline abuse and loud music!
Tetsuo (meaning The Iron Man)
is a terrifying concoction o f gore
and metal. A metal fetishist forces
a rusting steel bar into his thigh.
The wound becomes inevitably
maggot-infested and, in panic, he is
injured by a hit-and-run driver.
T h r o u g h telepathy a n d other
weirdness, the victim begins to
warp and plague the driver's mind
as both are slowly engulfed by the
invincible metal the punk loves.
The film is crude and gut-
with considerably embarrassment
that we showed them to rooms
which, despite the efforts detailed
previously, contained stained and
threadbare carpets, peeling paint on
the w a l l s a n d c e i l i n g s , a n d
extremely old furniture. W e hope
that bringing this matter to your
attention w i l l p r o m o t e some
discussion concerning the current
state o f I C accommodation.
Yours sincerely,
Richard Evans,
Louise Rickard.

wrenching in its sick perversions
and humour. Anything but subtle,
the driver and his fiancee go
through ten positions in as many
seconds before his penis mutates
into an erotic power drill - you can
imagine the rest. This is, of course,
that he dreams o f being buggered
by a snake.
