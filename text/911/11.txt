Union Building
Done Up
Students who have already made
use of the Union Building this term
may have noticed that it has
received a substantial facelift over
the summer. The entire building has
been redecorated and large areas,
including the toilets and Ents.
Lounge and U n i o n Office, have
been refitted. Mandy Hurford,
Union Manager, estimated the total
cost at about £60,000.
The money came mostly from the
About fifty pounds in forged ten
pound notes have been passed to
union facilities in the last two
w e e k s . A c c o r d i n g to A n d y
Flannagan; Union Bar manager,
such notes are presently flooding
North and West London.
The forgery was detected when
the Bar's takings were sent to the
bank which informed the police and
the bar of the fake notes' existence.
Although it is thought that there are
some people deliberately using the
notes, there have been cases of
naive students unwittingly passing
over forgeries. O n the Friday
before term, 27 September, a
student entered the U n i o n Bar and
handed over a note which had
neither a watermark nor a solid line
down the centre. It was immediately
returned to the disconcerted student
who claimed he had no knowledge
that the note was a forgery.
At the Royal College of Science
Union Carnival on Monday night,
two notes with the word 'forgery'
written on them were handed over
to the attendant of the burger stall.
This was only noticed after the
U n i o n ' s B a r and C a t e r i n g
Committee and House Committee
(responsible for the upkeep of the
building) with only a £7,500
contribution from the College
authorities.
T h e m o v e f o l l o w e d a
questionnaire circulated amongst
students which revealed that many
students avoided the union building
because of the poor decor and
standard of cleanliness.
event since the people on the stall
could not see the writing due to the
difficult circumstances. Ramesh
Patel, assistant bar manager, said
that in future a lamp will be
p r o v i d e d for the benefit o f
stallholders.
Roger Pownall, Southside Bar
manager, said that he had not been
offered any forgeries yet, but he had
seen one and claimed that 'it looks
good but it feels awful' - a
d i s t i n g u i s h i n g feature o f the
forgeries since they are printed on
paper which is thicker than the
genuine note. A member of New
Scotland Y a r d commented that a
genuine note had four distinguishing
features; a water m a r k , a
continuous metal strip, quality
paper and quality print. He added
that no forgery had all four of these
qualities. He said further that he did
not consider the forgeries taken by
Imperial College Union to be part
of the £5m haul of £10 and £50
notes made in Harlow, Essex, in the
last few days and that it was far too
early in the investigation to make
any other statement.
Thieves
Terry Briley, security officer, has
expressed exasperation that people
have still not learned that valuables
left unattended are easy pickings.
He said that the number of wallets
stolen were about average for this
time of year when thieves can
masquerade as freshers with little
difficulty.
Wallets have been stolen from the
Student U n i o n , the P h y s i c s
Department, the Maths Department
and the Health Centre. In all cases
the thieves walked into an unlocked
office and simply took them from
unattended jackets.
Dramatic
The Imperial College Dramatic
Society, DramSoc, had both a
windfall and a loss over the
Summer. While organising the
' T h e a t r e W e s t E n d ' ( T W E )
contribution the the Edinburgh
Fringe festival, they entered a prize
draw for dramatic societies, and
won a lighting desk worth £3000.
O n return from Edinburgh, on the
1st September, all the lighting and
sound equipment was left in the
concert hall, behind a single locked
door. The equipment was checked
and all was found to be present on
the 3rd, but when setting up for
fresher's week, much was found to
be missing.
A n inventory was taken and over
£9,000 of equipment (replacement
cost) was found to be missing. The
lighting and audio gear was
described as being ideal for a band
or small theatre,consisting of lights,
and a complete 500 Watt pa system.
Police have been informed, but no
progress has yet been made.
T o n i g h t sees the second
carnival of the year. A l l the
tickets have been sold except
the hundred which will be sold
at the entrance to Beit Quad at
the time.
Because fire regulations
restrict the number o f people
alowed in the Union Building
at any one time, entrance to the
Union Building on all carnival
nights is by ticket only along
with a student union card.

Lack of licence
loses lucrative
gig
The band ' L u s h ' , due to play a
concert in the U n i o n on the 9th
October have pulled out. The
Promoters, Metropolis M u s i c ,
booked what they thought was an
open show with no restrictions on
entry. Imperial College Union is not
p e r m i t t e d to h o l d a p u b l i c
entertainments licence, needed for
this type of event, so only students
of the college would be allowed to
attend.
Because of this. Metropolis
agreed to co-promote the show with
Imperial College Ents with tickets
stating 'students and their guests
only'. Despite this, Metropolis
continued to set up an open show,
against the I C U byelaws.
M u c h advertising had already
been circulated, but when the band
heard of the restrictions, they pulled
out of the show. Ents Chairman,
Graham Lawton, who originally
booked the band, said 'We spent a
lot of time trying to rescue it, but
there's nothing we could do'.
