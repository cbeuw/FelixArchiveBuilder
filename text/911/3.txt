Thanks On Y Rad io
for the

Life, the universe and everything?
What would you give, right now,
for a two page document containing
the answers to every question on
your final exams? N o risk, no
strings...Probably a lot?
What would you give for the
answers to what life is about? N o w
immediately y o u ' r e saying to
yourself, 'Cute, another little advert
for religion. Y o u can have the
answer to the ultimate questions of
existence!...'
Well it's rather awkward, but, the
truth is something like that. In fact,
Christianity does not claim to
provide the truth about man's
existence. It's not quite as easy as
sending in a self-addressed envelope
and getting back simple answers to
universal questions. Perplexities
remain. Questions still rise, in fact
discovering truth always raises new
questions. But, Christianity is truth.
It's hard, substantial, weighty
enough truth to have captured the
m i n d s and i m a g i n a t i o n s o f
Augustine, Aquinas, Pascal and
Newton. It's deep enough and
broad enough to have been the
foundation of Western civilisation
for most of the last two millennia.
The core of this truth is simple
enough to be grasped by a child and
profound enough to feed poets and
philosophers through the ages; there
is a person behind what we see and
experience and that person cares
about you. G o d loves you.
If that's true, it's worth knowing.
If H e ' s true, H e ' s worth knowing.
A lot of people, many of them sane,
reasonable and even intelligent
believe they do know H i m , and that
knowing G o d is the sweetest thing
possible.
T h e truth i s n ' t easy, but
profoundly good. Is it worth
looking into?
If you are interested in knowing
more we are running a series of
presentations and discussions on the
core facts of Christianity every
Tuesday from Oct 8 at 12.30pm in
Elec Eng 508 or you can contact me
on 071-584 2933 or through my
pigeonhole.

D o you want to be a DJ?
By the time you read this you will
probably be suffering from the
extremes of Freshers' Week, but if
you've ever considered being a D J
then keep your tired and gritty eyes
open a moment longer and read on.
O n e o f the many services
provided by the U n i o n is IC Radio.
W e broadcast across campus on 999
k H z A M and are linked by high
quality land lines to many parts of
college including the J C R and
Southside bar.
So, if you've ever listened to the
radio and thought you wouldn't
mind having a go or that you could
do better yourself, or perhaps you
would prefer to be behind the
scenes helping with the technical
wizardry that keeps us together then
come down to our southside studio.
T h e studio is situated beside
S o u t h s i d e shop b e l o w
F a l m o u t h / K e o u g h and
Selkirk/Tizard halls. During the
summer the studio has been
completely rebuilt and refurbished,
and our extensive music library has
reached over 15,000 records and
several hundred C D s .
W h y not pop in and say hello and
maybe even get a cup of coffee!
Training is very simple and you
could be on the air this time next
week.
If you have any requests or
dedications you can call on the
internal telephones. 789 from
Southside, 3440 from anywhere
else in college.

London Nightline, the night time

polytechnics across L o n d o n , is
looking for new volunteers.
T w o volunteers man the phones
in the Nightline Office at U L U from
6pm to 8am every night during
termtime. After an initial training
and probationary period lasting one
term, each individual is on duty on
about four nights a term and in
addition is asked to attend ongoing
training sessions three times a term.
V o l u n t e e r s must r e m a i n
anonymous and respect the absolute
confidentiality of all calls. N o
experience is necessary just the
desire to help others by listening
without judging them or trying to
solve their problems.
Some calls are simply requests
for information from Nightline's
reference files, w h i c h c o v e r
everything from legal rights to
nightbus timetables and 'What's
O n ' in L o n d o n to phone numbers
of halls of residence. The training
programme also covers this aspect
of the work.
If you are interested in finding out
more about what becoming a
volunteer involves, Nightline are
holding an Introductory Meeting on
Thursday 17th October at 7.30pm
in room 3 A , U L U Building, Malet
Street, W l . A l l are welcome.
Alternatively have a chat with one
of the volunteers on duty by
phoning Nightline on 071-436 5561
or leave a message for Rob
Haddock, this year's sabbatical
coordinator of London Nightline on
the ansaphone during the day.
