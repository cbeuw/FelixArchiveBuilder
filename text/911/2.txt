El Presidente,
Zoe Hellinger,
talks of
violence, first
aid and women.
The College's smoking policy came
into force on 1st October. M a n y of
you will recall the questionnaire
sent to all students earlier this year.
The working party set up to review
the policy were guided by the
responses to that questionnaire.
In determining the need for a
smoking policy the college is
a c k n o w l e d g i n g the increasing
concern about the risks to health
incurred through s m o k i n g . A
formal policy minimises conflict
and misunderstandings.
The policy outlines areas in
college where smoking is banned.
These will be public circulation
areas such as lifts, corridors, toilets
and reception areas. Smoking will
not be permitted in official vehicles
and enclosed sports areas. Smoking
will not be permitted in college
catering facilities unless they are big
enough to accommodate a separate
Self-Defence T r a i n i n g
Recently published crime figures
show an increase of over 10% in
violent crime, including rape and
armed robbery. Indecent assaults
rose by 2 6 % , which included a 55 %
increase in offences among men.
Increasingly, an overstretched
police force voices its frustration at
people's apparent unwillingness to
take steps to prevent crimes against
themselves and their possessions.
Although South Kensington and
the surrounding boroughs are
probably the safest areas in London,
attacks have been known to happen.
For those who are worried about
possible attacks, a ' V i o l e n c e
Awareness Course' for both men
and women has been arranged by
the U n i o n .
Through simple but effective
techniques, y o u will learn how to
deal with situations, should they
a r i s e . T h e p h y s i c a l a n d
p s y c h o l o g i c a l s e l f - d e f e n c e
techniques taught to you will help
you to handle most situations that
threaten your personal safety. A l l
this is explained in a concise and
clear manner, showing how easy it
is to be both aware and safe.
The course takes place over two
2.5 hour sessions on Tuesday 8th
area for smokers. Bars will not be
affected by this policy.
The policy will be implemented
departmentally rather than imposed
across the college as a whole. Each
college workplace is different and
various characteristics and methods
of work will need to be considered.
There are some buildings and
departments where restrictions on
smoking already operate eg. lecture
theatres, meeting rooms, libraries
and l a b o r a t o r i e s . T h e s e
arrangements will continue.
The policy will apply to all
m e m b e r s o f staff, v i s i t o r s ,
contractors, conference delegates
and students.
Where accommodation permits
there will be areas where people
will be allowed to smoke. These
w i l l be i d e n t i f i e d w i t h i n
departments.
and Thursday 10th October at
6.00pm. The cost of the course will
be £3.00 (subsidised!!) and there
are limited places (30). If y o u
would like to attend then please
register in the U n i o n office by
5.30pm Monday 7th October.
F i r s t - A i d C o u r s e
W h a t would y o u do if your
neighbour in a lecture theatre
c o u l d n ' t breathe o r fell
unconscious? W o u l d y o u want to
help but not know how? If this is
the case then y o u should attend a
first aid course which leads to a
certificate of ability to practice first
aid.
There is an 11 week course
leading to the Health and Safety at
W o r k certificate taking place on the
college site. It begins on Monday
7th October at 6.00pm (finishes
9.30pm) and will be held in the
Holland Club (underneath the Great
Hall) every subsequent Monday.
The price o f this course is £15.00,
possibly the cheapest first aid
course y o u will get. If you would
like to attend then please contact
Roger Serpell on Internal Extension
4045. Places are limited to 24 and
will be allocated on a first come first
served basis.
H e l p for those w h o wish to give
u p s m o k i n g
Everyone recognises that giving up
smoking is not easy. O n e third of
smokers who responded to the
questionnaire expressed a desire to
stop smoking.
The Health Centre will again be
running a programme to help
people to give up smoking. These
will commence on October 1 and
j information can be obtained from
the Health Centre (ext. 3091).
To all clubs
and societies:
Deadline for all
news/results is
Monday each
week!
W o m e n
Certain difficulties are always
experienced by minorities within
any society, and women at I C , who
m a k e up o n l y 2 3 % o f the
population, are by no means
immune. T h e situation is certainly
not impossible to live with, women
have a good deal here considering
that the powers that be within
college are desperately attempting
to i n c r e a s e that p e r c e n t a g e .
However, it can be quite a strain
when y o u are surrounded by men
constantly. Often a time to relax in
a safe space amongst sympathetic
women is all y o u need to recover
a flagging spirit. If there are any
general problems encountered by
women, then this is the best forum
in which to discuss them.
In order to see whether there is
a need for this kind of a ground,
there will be an introductory
meeting on Tuesday 8th October at
lpm (bring your lunch) in the Union
Senior C o m m o n R o o m . Both
women and men are invited in order
to test the acceptability of this kind
of group amongst the IC population.
If you have any constructive ideas
for this group then I hope to see you
there!
Students can also encourage their
fellow students and offer support to
those who are going through a
difficult time.
The policy is not intended to
create a situation within which
s m o k e r s w i l l feel alienated.
However, non-smoking is to be the
norm at Imperial College and as
with any college rule, repeated
disregard could lead to disciplinary
action.
