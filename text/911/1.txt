Suffer for Sport?
Student facility or private health spa ?
Proposed changes to the college's
sports centre by Prince's Gardens
have caused fury amongst the
student body. These changes
include a conversion of the present
Gym-cum-weights room into a cafe
or lounge area, and inclusion of
saunas, sun-beds and Jacuzzis. In
addition, prices for students are
going to up and access times for
sports clubs will be limited or
moved.
The price for a season ticket this
year is £18 for nine months - as
three months will be used for
refurbishment - compared to £12
for twelve months last year. It is
projected that next year the price
will be £24 for students, which
compares to £100 for non-college
people.
This refurbishment is due to take
place in Spring 1992 for 12-16
weeks at an estimated cost of
between £300,000 and half a
million pounds. In a written note
G o r d o n Marshall, Director of
Estates, referred to the 'South
Kensington Sports Centre' and said
that it was intended 'to market
improvements to make the centre
self financing and it possible profit
making.' In addition, Southside
gym would be divided in two, one
half to replace the g y m previously
in the Sports Centre, the other for
the events that usually take place in
it.
Ray Coleman, Manager of the
Sports Centre, told Felix that he
believed the refurbishment was to
be financed by a loan from the
college. He said that the new idea
'appeals to students and staff we
can attract people from outside to
pay competitive rates to subsidise
student and staff use of sports
facilities.' H e added that 'at the
moment we can't justify external
rates... I can't promise that there
won't be an increase (in student
prices) but not a great increase'.
Zoe Hellinger, U n i o n President,
said that she had recieved a number
of complaints from clubs using the
swimming pool. T h e underwater
club will have its session moved so
that it will not finish until 10.30pm
rather than 9.30pm as at present.
Other clubs have said that the
unsocial hours they have been
allocated mean that they are less
attractive to new members. They
also say that few students wish to
exercise so late in the evening as
they are too tired.
Other complaints from clubs of
the Athletic Clubs Committee
( A C C ) include the belief that there
would be too few cubicles for the
swimming pool, the centre doesn't
need another bar - which won't
have any alcoholic drinks - and that
a sports centre ought to maximise
its sports facilities rather than have
snack bars.
Craig Robinson, Squash C l u b
captain, told Felix that 'nobody has
been told what Ray Coleman's brief
is... it appears to be a self financing
brief". T h e A C C said that it
believed that M r Coleman was not
remotely interested in student
facilities and had said so on more
than one occasion.
This is not the first time the
Sports Centre has been in the lime-
light. When it was built it cost just
over a quarter o f a million pounds
and was beset by t e c h n i c a l
problems, postponing the opening
and increasing the planned costs. It
was originally intended to be open
to both students and staff of the
College, as was reported in Felix,
2nd October 1968. N o mention was
made by R e x L o w i n , U n i o n
President of that year, of outside
usage or profit. Finance for the
centre came almost equally from the
College and outside grants. T h e
entrance charge was a shilling (just
five pence) for entrance to the pool
and squash courts. Today it will
cost you eighty pence if you are an
Imperial student and £1.75 if y o u
are not.
See next week's letters for further
comment.
New
Security
Imperial College will have a new
security system by January 1992 if
everything goes as planned. T h e
system will require each student to
carry an identification card to gain
access to campus buildings after
normal hours, although the campus
will be open as usual during the
day.
Terry Briley, College Security
Officer, told Felix that the cost was
under discussion. ' W e are still
doing a lot of homework', he
added. T h e College will be paying
for the new system, and the
identification cards will be provided
with no cost to the students. T can't
see how it can be detrimental to
anybody,' said Jonathan Griffiths,
U n i o n Deputy President.
M r Griffiths said that he thought
it would be a 'preventative measure
rather than t r y i n g to cure
something.' Each student will have
an identification number which will
automatically enter the system when
the card is used. T h e system will
record the movements of each
individual around campus. There is
the possibility that an unwelcome
individual's movements can be
limited by programming their
number into the system to be
rejected. M r Briley said that the
precise details o f the system
depended on which one college
chose.
Both Messrs Briley and Griffiths
said that in their opinion the
administration and the students feel
that the system is a good idea. ' W e
will all benefit from it,' said M r .
Griffiths, ' n o one should be
wandering around the quad for any
reason.' T h e proposal is currently
being reviewed by all of the
departmental heads. If it is
a p p r o v e d by e v e r y o n e , then
installation will begin ready for use
early next year. M r Briley ended by
saying that 'it would be best to say
that college is looking into a
college-wide security system.'
