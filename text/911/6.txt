In the year of our lord 1991 there
came a great storm in the wilderness
that strove to bring you news of
what goes on in this funky town
(who did Funky T o w n anyway?).
Since most of you are impov
(erished) students and have little in
the way of fiscal embellishments, it
might be handy for you if we give
you the benefit of our accumulated
wisdom.
Thirty simple ways to enjoy
yourself at Imperial College :
Some of these are less likely than
others. For example, 22 is a really
bad idea. A s is anything to do with
sex. N o , hang on, that's wrong, sex
is a G O O D idea, it's just less likely
than the others 'spesh at Imperial.
If you like females (human) then
there aren't enough to go round

points. B R O W N I E S ! ) T h e figures

geologists out there go gay since
you're all such enlightened people
(hi there freshers, in-house gag,
you'll find out).
Ladies! D o you enjoy being
pursued by every piss-artist for
miles who fancies himself? Thought
so.
That's why, pausing only to vent
our wrath, we recommend you find
an agreeable amphibian friend to
imitate in alcoholic exellence. This
is best done in one of the U n i o n
bars. W H Y ? D o you like to pay
over two pounds for a lager? If not
then avoid pubs and head for the on-
site bars. Southside (college bar) is
dark, moody and full of good vibes
(personal opinion). Pick the right
night and y o u ' l l find a disco that
avoids disco muzak. The Union bar
in the Beit Quad is more cliquey and
alcoholic but has a friendly crowd
of regulars with a smile and a song
for every honest artisan.
G o i n g to the cinema in L o n d o n
is an experience which can hurt you
badly in the wallet unless you pick
carefully. F o r a start, it's always
worth making sure you really want
to see whatever it is you're going
to see because an average show will
leave you emotionally, morally and
p h y s i c a l l y about five pounds
lighter. It is possible to find cheaper
cinemas than this by : xviii) going
to the kind of film that you go to
by yourself; xvii) going too early ;
xvi) flying V i r g i n Atlantic to
Seattle. In fact almost anything
(discussing codfish, celebrity all-
star curling etc) offers more return
than a random visit to a London
cinema. T o pick the best film to see
we find the most accurate and
impartial reviews come in Felix in
easy to read prose with pictures and
everything and they're really good
and my mate says he's met one of
the reviewers and everything and
they're great.
Theatre in L o n d o n is often as
cheap as the cinema if you buy
tickets at the last minute. It can open
new vistas ot pleasure and
experience or merely subject you to
three hours of Andrew L l o y d -
Webber drivel. W h e n you first
c a m e here y o u were almost
certainly told that one of the
highlights of L o n d o n was its
T H E A T R E . T a k i n g his sound
advice, most of you will never go.
That's probably - hell, we don't
know anything about theatre. Jonty
does, he's the Theatre Sub-Editor
thingy, ask him.
H a v e y o u been w a t c h i n g
Thunderbirds? B y an amazing
coincidence there used to be Gerry
A n d e r s o n exhibition at A l t o n
Towers, and he did Thunderbirds.
Alton Towers (Stafford) is great fun
and marvellous value at under £9
for a day of frolics and roller-
coaster a d v e n t u r e s . S t r i c t l y
speaking Alton Towers isn't in
London but there is a model of B i g
Ben in the 'Round the W o r l d ' crazy
golf. In fact B i g Ben is only the
name of the bell and the clock is
only Westminster Palace clock
tower.
Dancing is great way to lose
weight and tone muscle. It's almost
as good as eating celery. There are
many places to dance such as

clubs oozing from every pustule; a
lot of the better ones give out flyers
in record shops etc. which make the
entrance prices more bearable.
Shopping. Oxford Street is not as
exciting as it should be. Don't be
conned into buying a twenty-piece
dinner set. It happens (Hi there
Dav) more often than you would
think ie. once to ourknowledge.
That's one out of the eight people
in our household, therefore about
nine hundred thousand people in the
Greater L o n d o n A r e a have been
caught this way (statistics), so watch

clothes to horses, books to bonfires,
comics to rubber and leather a-go-

Improve, expand, reanimate,
exhilarate, exterminate, redecorate
your mind. There are numerous
ways of doing this. Most of these
involve brightly coloured disco
biscuits of one variety or another.
Alternatively you can take up Z e n
Buddhism, a course of action which
you can easily take up if the bald
gentlemen outside H M V catch you.
One o f the advantages o f this
method is that with the right cocktail
you can easily generate your own
newt to j o i n y o u o n y o u r
p h a r m a c e u t i c a l / p h i l o s o p h i c a l
adventure. A t this point it may
(although it's unlikely) be relevant
(big grey thing with a trunk) to
mention that sex will do many of the
a b o v e , although l o s i n g y o u r
virginity will not make you shave
your head (except for a tufty bit at
the back) and sell books to complete
strangers. (If you fantasise that your
partner is a newt then good luck to
you.)

golly it does you credit missus.
Music. Y o u can't stop the music.
Nobody can stop the music. Tell the
birds ' D o n ' t sing!' Tell the sun
'Don't shine!' Because that's easier
to do.
There are loads (read lerds) of
exhibitions in London. Some are
permanant such as the Guinness
World of Records in the Trocadero,
some are temporary like last year's
L e g o Motor Show at the Science
M u s e u m , and some are imaginary
like the K i m Basinger N u d e
exhibition in Hyde Park (pause for
reflection. C o m b hair). The Science
M u s e u m is smashing super lovely
because as a member of the
Imperial allumni you will get free
admission. If scientifically minded
then there is lots to see , if not then
you're at the wrong college. The
Natural History M u s e u m wouldn't
give you free entry if you were K i m
Basinger nude (spot my hang up
kids). If you should be wandering
wistfully through H y d e Park
anyway then make it on Sundays
because then you get to laugh at the
sad cases at Speaker's Corner (Free
Nelson Mandela, Jesus Is Not Only
A l i v e But H e ' s M e , Socialist
Worker Student Party etc) and join
in if you like. Y o u may even meet
the gentlemen from H M V if you
try. While we're on the subject,
remember you should eat less
protein and suppress your carnal
urges. F o r further information on
this valuable dietary insight ask the
highly conspicuous gentleman on
O x f o r d Street. T h e Aetherius
Society, best known for their well-
researched claim that Jesus came
from Venus, visit Imperial every
year With Evidence. In the same
vein, so does the Minister F o r
Education. H e ' s not quite as
entertaining. It's a poor day in
L o n d o n if you don't spot at least
one loony.
Checking out at Sainsbury's may
not sound so exciting, but bear in
mind other places that you check
out of. Checking out of your suite
at the Hilton, out of intensive care,
all exciting places and there's no
reason you shouldn't add your local
supermarket to this list. Quite apart
from anything else, you'll probably
manage to combine it with loony-
spotting. If you don't get offered a
gold chain on your way out and
have to beat up small children it will
be an unusual trip indeed. Another
bonus of the Kensington store is
celeb-spotting; Willie Rushton! Jan
H o w a r d from Howard's Way!
T h e y ' r e all there kids!
There are enough societies at
Imperial to shake rather a large stick
at. If you do anything that there isn't
a soc for then either start one, or
realize you're a pervy and lurk a
while. The freshers fair shows you
what's available so we're not
telling. Wearing socks is a great
pastime. W a r m toes, enclosed
ankles, something to make holes in.
Crap gags are what we do, At
half past one or half past two, Some
for us and some for you, Doobee

Sex with an animated newt.. .etc.
If you try this, you really haven't
got the hang o f this recreation lark,
have you? Remember, if you can't
find a friend (or an consenting newt)
to have sex with, why not try a
business partner? In Australia sex
is a collective name for cloth bags.
Finally, if all this gets you down,
remember you're luckier than
some. A flatworm's penis comes
out of its mouth and is accorded
with spikes and poison glands.
