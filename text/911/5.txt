Does global warming present a
p r o b l e m ? A r e scientists
scaremongering? What will happen
if carbon dioxide release into the
atmosphere is not curbed? What is
the cost of limiting emissions?
Questions like these will be tackled
by D r Jeremy Leggett, a research
d i r e c t o r for G r e e n p e a c e
International and former earth
sciences lecturer at Imperial
College, next Wednesday. W e
preview some of the answers from
his book 'Global Warming - the
Greenpeace Report'
Global warming often appears to
be presented in two different ways.
T h e greens are v i e w e d as
harbingers of catastrophe and
prescribe lifestyles unacceptable to
most people. The other view is that
the scientists are being alarmist, that
it is pointless to spent huge
quantities of money on a problem
that might not materialise.
' G l o b a l w a r m i n g - the
Greenpeace Report' presents, very
clearly and apolitically, the middle
road. The broad scientific basis to
global warming is fairly well
known, but what most 'people on
the street' find hard to understand
is the c o n c e p t o f s c i e n t i f i c
uncertainty, the uses of figures with
error limits. Given that even the
simplest measurement is subject to
uncertainty, how much more so the
problem of climatic modelling.
' . . . M a n y c r i t i q u e s s o m e h o w
understress the fact that the sword
of uncertainty has two blades: that
is, uncertainties in physical or
biological processes which make it
possible for the present generation
of models to have overestimated
future warming effects, are just as
likely to have caused the models to
have underestimated change...' The
problem is compounded by the fact
that natural weather variations are
large, so that it is difficult to pick
up the initial stages of a trend to a
warmer earth. What is certain,
however, is that the atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide is
very high, and is increasing rapidly.
Analyses of cores taken from the ice
caps show that high carbon dioxide
levels are associated with higher
earth temperatures.
M a n y people argue that global
warming may be a good thing.
After all, cold areas in the world
will surely become fertile, and the
increased carbon dioxide will
stimulate plant g r o w t h , thus
Dr Jeremy Leggett is the first
speaker in this year's Physics
Departmental Colloquia series.

Climate of Change', the colloquia

trapping more carbon? The experts
think not. Plant growth depends on
nutrient availability, which may not
increase. R e s p i r a t i o n ( w h i c h
releases carbon dioxide) of plants
and soil microbes is stimulated by
warming more than photosynthesis

mass extinction, plant species will

main electricity consumers), than to
b u i l d new p o w e r stations.
Information about efficient energy
use is needed to increase consumer
awareness of the cost-effectiveness
of insulation measures, and the use
of renewable-energy sources, which
can completely replace fossil and
nuclear fuels. '.. .Technology exists

temperature heat (up to 1,400
degrees C) directly from natural
Insulate
M o r e o v e r , increase in global
temperature will mean much greater
variability in weather patterns: we
can expect more storms, more
flooding, more drought, more
harvest failure and reduced lowland
rainfall. In addition, pests that die
in cold winters may survive, and
disease epidemics are likely to
sweep across a world competing for
clean water supplies. The outlook
seems bleak.
What can be done? Advocates of
sackcloth and ashes rarely get a
warm reception. It is obvious that
the output of carbon dioxide (and
other pollutants) must be
dramatically curtailed to prevent a
rapid change in the earth's average
temperature. What is completely
wrong is the conception that
reduced output is going to cost a
huge sum of money. The West must
is increase efficiency of energy use,
a measure that in the long term
actually saves money. '...It is
generally cheaper today to save fuel
than to burn it. A v o i d i n g pollution
by not burning the fuel can
therefore be achieved, not at a cost,
but at a profit - so this result can and
should be widely implemented in
the market-place...' A chapter on
energy efficiency in ' G l o b a l
W a r m i n g ' demonstrates how U S
electricity-generating utilities find it
cheaper to subsidise energy-
efficient lighting and motors (the
resources available at a remote
location in nearly any country. The
demand can be satisfied without
transporting a continuous, long-
distance stream of fuel or running
l o n g - d i s t a n c e e l e c t r i c - p o w e r
transmission lines - or emitting vast
quantities o f greenhouse gases...
There is no qualification needed for
these statements. Technically, it is
possible. Economically, it is a more
limited situation, but not nearly as
most observers and analysts
believe...' Indeed, if governments
stopped subsidising fossil fuel
usage, but diverted some of that
money towards energy-efficient
usage of renewable energy, the
greenhouse effect could largely be
mitigated.
T h e industrial revolutions of the
first world involved relatively small
populations, hence relatively small
release of carbon dioxide. O l d and
inefficient technology in a Chinese
industrial revolution would result in
the release of huge quantities of
greenhouse gases. Since lesser-
developed countries ( L D C s ) want to
grow, the first world must supply
the appropriate technologies, and
encourage them to use it. After all,
why build power stations and a
national grid, when, for a smaller
cost (both e c o n o m i c and
environmental) you can built micro-
grids supplied from renewable
resources?
If the world carries on with
'business-as-usual', the effects of
global w a r m i n g w i l l not be
pleasant. But the solution to the
problem is already available, and at
less cost. People and governments
must turn their backs on expensive
and finite fossil fuels, and think
efficiency, think renewable, think
long-term.
