Last week’s puzzle seems to have
been a bit too hard, so here’s an easier
offering – and, as promised, an expla-
nation of some more clue types.
Some clues point indirectly at the
answer without giving either two
definitions or any hint about the
answer’s letters. These ‘cryptic defi-
nitions’ (eg 7 down) are quite rare
because they’re hard to think up.
Most clues have both a definition
and a recipe for the letters. This
genre includes ‘hidden words’ where
the answer is embedded within the
clue (21 down), reversals (13 across)
and complex clues which put some
words within (14 down) or in front
of (12 across) others. Look out for
abbreviations, such as G for ‘good’
and O for ‘old’. Good luck! Snufkin
Felix Crossword 1303 by Snufkin
Having escaped from the Felix
office, Tank decides to extract horri-
ble and bloody revenge on his previ-
ous employers, Imperial College.
With his chameleon-like camou-
flage, Tank slipped into the college
undetected. Fools.
An army marches on it’s stomach,
and Tank’s hungry. However, liv-
ing in London and being shockingly
overdrawn, his tank-sized card is
spat back out. It’s not going well.
Desperate times, desperate meas-
ures. All’s game in love and war,
even stealing KitKats.
Tank’s run of truly bad luck comes to
an end as, defying all logic, he does
what nobody at Imperial College
thought was possible and meets a
girl. Go tank, go. You stud you.
It wasn’t meant to last. His new-
found lady friend realised that actu-
ally “he’s, like, a tank” and “totally
dumped him” for one of the football
team. Hurt and lonely, Tank does
what any self-respecting, red-blood-
ed male would do and heads out on
the lash. Legend.
Worse for wear, slightly lost and
without a degree in night buses,
Tank attempts to crawl home. Easily
distracted, and armed with tecnol-
ogy to hit a fresher from across the
room, he tries to shoot his way to
lager.
Oh dear, mission aborted. Running
low on batteries and morale, and
with the warmth of the Felix office
but a distant memory, Tank calls it
a night, only about three hours too
late. All in all, a complete and utter
failure of a day. Tank, we salute you.
Return of
the FUCWIT
For those who need it explaining,
FUCWIT is the Felix Unforgettable
Coffee-Break Weekly Issued
Tournament, and the league of
extraordinary FUCWITs is your
chance to show the world (well, the
college at least) just how incredibly,
amazingly clever you are. First of all
you, and your team, need to come up
with a suitably hillarious nickname
with which to be identified. It’s not
difficult – anything is better than El
Vino. Being generous, we’ll give a
point to the best one.
There’s four puzzles for you this
week, and here’s how they work:
Sex Tips: be creative and fill in
the blanks with your own word(s).
The best idea gets 10 points, there’s
five for the runner-up, and three
for third place. Plus anybody who
makes us laugh / is unprintable will
get a point too.
Cryptic Corner: Yes, we know how
hard this is, but you’re at Imperial,
you should be solving these things
in your sleep. We’re giving a suit-
ably generous 10 points for correct
answers here.
Rorke: Nice and easy, there’s a
point if you correctly identify the
film, and another point if you can
work out the name of the actor(s)
that Sam is replacing.
Tank: Just tell us where each
picture was taken. Don’t just say
Imperial College, you need to be
more specific than that. There’s a
point for each one.
That’s a grand total of 39 points
up for grabs. Good luck and enjoy.
This year, the editor has given his
personal guarantee that we really
do have money for prizes available,
so get started now!
Your mission, should you be bored enough to accept it: Follow
Tank around College and just tell us where he is.
Tank’s mission: destroy Imperial College...
