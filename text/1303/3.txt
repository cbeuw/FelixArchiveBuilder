Think thrice before you
download music
The music industry has been through hell and back. Numaan Chaudhry investigates
So you’ve got yourself the
latest 40Gb Apple iPod and
you’re pondering what exact-
ly to saturate such a huge
capacity with. With download
speeds of up to 400Mb per
second, it’s hard to ignore
the temptation to download
music straight to your iPod
through the internet. Looking
past the iPod’s own prob-
lems (www.ipodsdirtysecret.
com), the risks of this much
adjourned illegal practice are
hardly worth taking, not least
if you’ve made it to Imperial
and can look forward to an
enriched future with count-
less bounties.
‘Twas a gloomy evening in
late July 1999 when Shawn
Fanning received his college
results and saw all hope of
an education vanish as he
realises his grades weren’t
good enough to pass into the
next year. So in turning to
the internet for his newfound
venture, he initiated work on
a project that has revolution-
ized the music industry and
churned the guts of even the
largest of music record retail-
ers: Napster.
Napster’s instant success
was due to a combination of
the consumer’s frustration at
the rising prices of records as
compared to their European
counterparts, and the gradu-
al introduction of broadband,
which made downloads up to
ten times faster. It attracted
over 80 million users follow-
ing its debut five years ago on
www.download.com, where it
was first uploaded to by the
author, then aged 18.
Fanning had three prima-
ry purposes for developing
Napster: to act as a search
engine dedicated to finding
MP3 files only, to develop fur-
ther the ability to trade MP3
files directly between users,
and to integrate into this an
internet relay chat, a proto-
col that enables communi-
cation between the sharing
parties. It wasn’t long before
Napster became a worldwide
filesharing community, and
the implications of this most
innovative web application
were brought to light by the
Record Industry Association
of America (RIAA).
2001 was the worst year
for the music industry, with
retailers and artists being hit
especially hard. There are no
prizes for guessing the root
cause of this. In May 2002,
after a spontaneous resigna-
tion by Napster’s board of
directors and CEO, the com-
pany fell and the tornado of
legislation wiped any remain-
ing symbols of its illegitimate
existence (there is now a
legitimate version of Napster
available at www.napster.
com, but is hardly worth the
download).
Now, although the number
of internet music file-sharing
users has drastically reduced,
the number of users with
illegal music on their home
computers has increased at
a staggering rate with inter-
net sites and new file-sharing
programs, including Kazaa
and eMule, all to blame.
The consequences, to both
musicretailersandevensome
users, of leeching albums by
illegal methods are stunning.
Earlier this month, the British
Phonographic Industry (BPI)
announced it would be prose-
cuting 28 individuals who are
accused of downloading and
uploading copyright material,
mainly MP3s, onto file-shar-
ing networks. To hammer
home it’s no tolerance mes-
sage to ‘hardcore uploaders’,
the BPI has decided to make
public the names of the indi-
viduals responsible.
Earlier this year, the RIAA
filed more than 900 subpoe-
nas, a demand to stand in
court, targeted specifically at
students downloading mate-
rial illegally on campus. And
now we hear reports of stu-
dents settling with the music
industry for up to $10,000, the
equivalent of buying over 500
albums from HMV! Having
witnessed the success of this
scheme, the BPI is pursu-
ing similar strategies in the
UK and, apart from the 28
aforementioned individuals
it is suing, it is implement-
ing procedures to seize and
remove all offending content
from free MP3 sites.
As for those pirates who
justify their downloading
using the flawed argument
that “downloading music will
make otherwise unknown art-
ists heard and hence increase
their sales”, much can be
said. For instance, what if it
is the desire of these artists
to be discreet and infamous,
as was the case of Pink, the
24-year old pop star, who now
desires privacy over fortune
and fame? And what about
the effects to the ‘known’ art-
ists and their record labels,
who suffer massive unneces-
sary slumps in revenues and
hence profits.
Finally, now that the BPI
has commenced a crackdown
on music abusers in the UK,
is it even worth sharing music
online, despite the temptation
and the fact that you can get
the latest singles in under a
minute? It depends on wheth-
er you think that putting ‘yes’
on an employer’s form under
the heading ‘Have you ever
been convicted in the past?’
will jeopardise your future.
It’s worth considering the
alternatives: buying albums
directly from the likes of
Virgin and HMV or, if that
seems a bit distasteful to your
student loan, try download-
ing music... legally, of course.
Apple iTunes, which boasts
the largest legal online collec-
tion of tracks, offers MP3s for
as little as 99¢ (55p) per song
and £6 an album and lets you
hear a preview for 30 seconds
before you buy.
Despite the relatively mea-
gre collection of Microsoft’s
iTunes, I prefer it to Apple’s
due to the fact that Microsoft
has an online store feature
that allows the user to see
and listen to music playing on
various radio stations without
theadsandlameDJentertain-
ment. In addition, Microsoft
has radically improved the
mobility of songs once they
are downloaded – the technol-
ogy behind iTunes allows the
user to easily transport songs
from PC to handheld devices.
Regardless of which service
is used, they are both a safer
alternative than file-sharing
networks.
The third reason for not downloading music illegally: if these guys find out, they won’t let you get away with their
intellectual property
Latest
from the

Mile
Flight fight
Icelandair, the thriving air-
line led by Hannes Smarason,
announced its acquisition of
8.4% of easyJet, a stake sec-
ond in size only to that owned
by Easyjet founder Stelios.
Icelandair has recently
undertaken a frenzy of buy-
ing UK stocks and equity as a
means of diversifying its port-
folio and spreading risk.
M&S shareholders
teased again
Marks and Spencer
announced on Tuesday that
it is buying back £2.3bn of
shares at a price of 360p each,
pathetically lower than the
offer tendered by Philip Green
earlier this year. Stuart Rose,
the new CEO, will need to
show marked performance in
M&S since his appointment in
order to prevent Green from
acquiring the company at his
proposed second attempt in
January.
Joining Mercer?
Marsh & McLennan, the
biggest US-based insurance
broker in the world and the
owner of Mercer Consulting,
is set to launch an investiga-
tion into practices in London
after Spitzer, the New York
attorney, launched a probe
into Marsh’s US operations. It
is thought that Marsh, among
other insurers, is guilty of rig-
ging fake competition bids for
its clients. Beware, Marsh
investors – this has an uncan-
ny resemblance to, dare I say,
Enron (see Felix 1302).
