Hacking is a widely misunder-
stood term used by the media
to refer to the act of breaking
into other people’s systems
and generally doing stuff you
should not. Hacking is in fact
the art of skilful programming.
Cracking is the profane act of
breaking into computer sys-
tems. We are going to look at
the most common methods to
break into a system, and what
you can do to prevent it from
happening to you.
The most easily preventable
approach to gaining access
to a system involves crack-
ing your passwords, whether
done manually with a “dic-
tionary attack” which tries a
long list of possible passwords
(like your favourite pastime,
girlfriend’s birthday etc) or a
‘brute force attack’ where the
program tries every possible
combination of characters,
like turning the wheel of a safe
and trying every number com-
bination until it opens. With
the wonders of modern com-
puting, however, your average
cracker could write a small
program or script to do this
while he or she is watching a
week’s worth of Eastenders
episodes.
More advanced crackers
could use a technique called
packet sniffing (electronic
eavesdropping) to ascertain
your passwords and personal
information while you are
using the internet via compro-
mised systems. Then there
are so-called ‘script kiddies’,
untalented malicious individu-
als who would readily install
a small program such as a
Trojan horse or a key-logger
onto your computer, to capture
your passwords as you enter
them, or apply an exploit to a
bug in your computer’s soft-
ware. These are all things you
should be aware of, without
needing to have a complete
mastery of them. Sometimes
these techniques can come in
useful for legitimate purposes,
ie on your own systems if you
forget a password.
So, what can you do to
protect your computer from
crackers?
1. Use a password. It is
amazing that so many people
are capable of pressing the
“on” button on your laptop to
gainmiraculousaccesstoyour
entire collection of Friends
episodes, or more seriously,
your emails or college papers.
If you have a laptop or a desk-
top, you can set a BIOS pass-
word on top of your operat-
ing system password, which
is required to simply boot the
machine, so attempts to crack
your operating system pass-
word would first need to get
past your BIOS password. The
administrative password on a
Windows XP machine is weak
for the determined cracker: it
can be easily reset as long as
the machine has a floppy drive
and an on/off button. A BIOS
password is far less straight-
forward to bypass, and you
need that to start the machine
up in the first place. Just
make sure you do not forget
it. And as we have seen from
the different password crack-
ing methods above, choose
a good password that’s not
easily guessable! Some simple
maths will show that:
A lowercase password of
6 letters gives 266
= 3.09x108
possibilities, but a mixed (low-
ercase, uppercase, numbers)
password of 8 characters
gives 628
= 2.18x1014
possibili-
ties – so if you use uper/lower
cases and numbers you stand
a 7000% better chance of pro-
tecting your computer.
If you are the only one using
your computer, try not to use
the default administrator
account to log in. Your safest
bet is to set an administrator
password, then add a normal
user account (with a pass-
word) which you would use
for writing documents, emails
etc. This would limit the dam-
age possible from a program
being run without your knowl-
edge as, without the adminis-
trative access, it would not be
able to do much harm.
2. Lock your post when you
are away from the computer
for five minutes and there are
other people in the room. In
Windows XP
, you can press
ctrl-alt-del and “Lock com-
puter” to do this. This has
the effect of stopping poten-
tial misfits using the machine
until they or you type your
password in to ‘unlock’ it. If
you don’t have this option you
will need to enable the “secure
logon” feature (Control Panel
–> Users).
3. Keep your operating sys-
tem updated. If you are a
Microsoft Windows user, you
can easily update your com-
puter (visit http://windowsup-
date.microsoft.com) to make
sure your computer isn’t rid-
dled with security holes which
appear over time. Automatic
updates are a good idea. The
same applies for other operat-
ing systems.
As we will see next week,
these holes are easily exploit-
able and pose a significant
risk for your computer to
get infected with spyware,
adware, viruses and Trojans.

Duma ratifies Kyoto
Russia’s lower house of parlia-
ment ratified the Kyoto Proto-
col last Friday, making the pact
internationally binding at last.
To come into force, the proto-
col had to be ratified by coun-
tries accounting for at least
half of the developed nations’
greenhouse emissions. This
was much-needed support af-
ter the US, the world’s biggest
polluter, pulled out in 2001.
UN cloning treaty
on hold
Despite renewed pressure
from the Bush administration
to sign a global treaty banning
all forms of human cloning,
nothing will be decided before
the US elections next week.
The UN’s 191 member nations
remain divided on the issue
of cloning human embryos
for stem cell research, with
a group of 63 – led by the US
– opposing such “therapeutic”
uses.
One-atom-thick
material discovered
The new material, called
graphene, part of the fullerene
molecule family, is a two-di-
mensional flat molecule with
remarkable electronic, me-
chanical and chemical proper-
ties. Its applications include
the production of ultra-fast and
stable transistors. The discov-
ery brings the idea of ballistic
transistors – where electrons
can travel without collisions
– closer.
Satellites prove
space-time twists
Scientists have made direct
measurements that show the
Earth is twisting the fabric of
space-time as it rotates, also
known as frame-dragging.
These results are reported as
the first to prove an important
aspect of the General Theory of
Relativity. The measurements
show that the satellites’ orbits
warped in a manner consistent
with Einstein’s predictions.
Court rules that
whales and dolphins
cannot sue Bush
A three-judge panel of the US
9th Circuit Court of Appeals
in San Francisco, widely con-
sidered one of the most liberal
and activist in the country, said
it saw no reason why animals
should not be allowed to sue
but said they had not yet been
granted that right. The lawsuit
claimed that the US Navy’s use
of sonar equipment harms ma-
rine mammals.
Novel malaria vaccine now in sight
As research closes in on a malaria vaccine, Emma Williams reports on
this and another preventative method being developed at Imperial
For many people, going on
an exotic holiday generally
means taking medicines or
having vaccines against infec-
tious diseases. Nowadays
they are easily available and
affordable. However, the peo-
ple who live in these countries
face the ongoing struggle of
trying to reduce the incidence
of such diseases like malaria.
For these people the loss of
a few days’ work through ill-
ness is devastating. However,
times may be changing, as it
was reported this week that
there are hopes of finding a
malaria vaccine by 2010. Such
a vaccine would offer hope to
many people who suffer both
physically and financially
from attacks of malaria.
The RTS,S/ASO2A vaccine
was given to children between
the ages of one and four living
in Mozambique. The vaccine
attacks what is known as the
sporozoite stage of develop-
ment of the parasite. The spo-
rozoites are injected by the
mosquito into the blood of the
human host. Prior immunisa-
tion initiates the production
of antibodies and white blood
cells that lock onto the para-
site in the blood, reducing its
survival and further develop-
ment. The project was funded
by GlaxoSmithKline biologi-
cals (GSK) and through a glo-
bal project called the PATH
Malaria Vaccine Initiative,
funded by the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation.
Malaria kills over one mil-
lion people every year and its
impact on world health is sec-
ond only to tuberculosis. The
parasitic disease is prevalent
in 90 countries and affects
one in ten of the world’s popu-
lation. Malaria is caused by
the parasite plasmodium
and is transmitted via the
mosquito. There are many
life cycle stages of the para-
site, completed both in the
mosquito and human hosts.
These stages can cause cyclic
bouts of fever and chills.
Severe forms of the infection
can lead to kidney and brain
damage, anaemia, coma and
eventually death.
Finding new ways to pre-
vent malarial transmission is
becoming increasingly impor-
tant due to the high levels of
resistancetotraditionaldrugs
and insecticides. Political and
social upheaval has led to
large numbers of people relo-
cating to new areas where
the disease can be spread
more easily. Additionally,
changes in the environment
such as road building, mining
and irrigation have produced
new breeding grounds for
mosquitos.
Closer to home, Imperial
College PhD students and
post-doctoral researchers
are working on similar ways
to prevent malaria transmis-
sion. One candidate currently
being tested in Thailand is
a transmission blocking vac-
cine. While the GSK vaccine
prevents the infection of the
human host, this transmis-
sion blocking vaccine pre-
vents parasitic agents taken
from human host blood from
developing in the mosquito
and therefore precludes their
further transmission.
One current PhD project is
examining methods to evalu-
ate the efficacy of malaria
vaccines. Current so-called
‘gold standard’ tests take 10
days to complete. New tech-
niques are being developed
that are quicker and more
robust to observe whether
the vaccine is working and to
monitor if the parasite count
is lowered. Serum from blood
samples taken from immu-
nised patients is used to cul-
ture the parasite in vitro (ie
outside the host).
PhD student, Souraya
Ramjanee told Felix: “It is
hoped that the development
of new techniques will reduce
time and labour input and will
in the long term lower costs
associated with the develop-
ment of new malaria vac-
cines, funding for which can
be very difficult to obtain.”
In the future it is hoped
that by using a combination
of preventative methods, the
incidence of malaria infec-
tions will decrease. These
measures will include not
only the use of vaccines, but
also insecticide impregnated
bed nets and environmental
control.
Research at Imperial may one day prevent transmission of
malaria by halting parasites developing in mosquitos
