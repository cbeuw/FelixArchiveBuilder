Noughties beats and eighties pop
RJD2 has been hailed as yet another sample maestro in the vein of DJ Shadow, but his
sophomore record seems to be stuck in around 1984

ALBUM REVIEW
With his commercial debut
Deadringer, RJD2 (real name R
J Krohn) caused a stir among hip-
sters and critics alike as they fell
over themselves to try to pin the
“new DJ Shadow” label on him. His
weighty beats and seriously efficient
sampling toyed with both commer-
cial hip-hop and Cut Chemist-style
underground.
The follow-up, the nostalgically
titled Since We Last Spoke, is a
somewhat confusing affair. RJ leaps
around genres, styles and formats
endlessly, often within the space of a
single four-minute track, giving the
record an air of uneasiness and dis-
quiet. The title track is full of halting,
stuttering silences between gritty
guitars and a glorious, harmonising
vocal; this conjures up images of
modern urban decay – boarded up
buildings and flyposting.
Whereas Deadringer could feel
impersonal, almost robotic at times,
Since We Last Spoke is warm,
welcoming, and at times, touch-
ing. Someone’s Second Kiss opens
with menancing, crackly piano
over skittering, broken beats; the
lush-sounding disco vocal slides in
almost unnoticed before the track
dissolves into analogue, Moog bleep-
ing. It’s an awe-inspiring piece of
downbeat hip-hop. Clean Living is
mellowed out seventies disco, with
yet another perfect vocal sample:
“Everybody’s life goes on / like a
melancholy song”. RJ allows the
piano sound from the original track
to bleed through, before surprising
you with steel drums and wah-wah
guitar; again, the inventiveness and
sheer playfulness shines through.
The nostalgic feeling of the name
extends itself into the record, most of
which seems to be stuck in the early
eighties or late seventies, an era of
hair-metal guitar solos, expensive
analogue synthesisers and glori-
ously over the top disco funk. Listen
to 1976 and you’re listening to the
best cop-show theme tune that was
never screened. Scratchy guitars,
motown horns and a stupidly funky
bassline make me think of police
helicopters over LA, or cop chases
down alleys full of boxes. To All Of
You wouldn’t seem out of place on
a compilation between Isaac Hayes
and the late, great, Barry White, so
authentic is its sampling of black
soul love themes.
Occasionally RJ seems to mis-
judge the level of cheesiness that’s
tolerable. Through The Walls pilfers
every dreadful eighties guitar band
for its palm-muted riff and awful,
breathy vocal; it almost sounds like
it should be on the soundtrack to The
Wedding Singer. However, these
moments are few and far between.
For the most part, Since We Last
Spoke is a triumph – an ambitious
blend of hip-hop, IDM, funk, soul
and just about every other genre
you care to name.

LIVE REVIEW
Decent bands? At the Union?
Surprising, I know.
This gig gained so little publicity,
it was a miracle that anyone showed
up at all. Boxer Rebellion alone are
capable of drawing a big enough
crowd to fill the Water Rats, and
even NME was all over their sin-
gle Watermelon. For Christ’s sake,
they’re signed to Alan McGee’s
Poptones label. Since this was an
“events” night at the Union, the not-
too-friendly bouncers were out in
force to make sure those scum of the
earth, non-Imperial types, were kept
out. A couple of our friends showed
up after I had already entered the
Union and, being fairly big Boxer
Rebellion fans, I went out to try
and sign them in as my ‘guests’. I
was treated as if I was trying to get
a pair of known criminals into the
premises.
That’s enough ranting about the
Union for this review. It’s actually
a great place to watch bands: the
stage is huge, the beer is cheap, and
the soundsystem is very respect-
able.
Unfortunately, we managed to miss
the first band on the bill, but headed
into dBs to watch Headway. Looking
like the generic, straight outta
Camden indie band, I was expecting
a set of mid-paced, melodic pop. What
we got instead was huge choruses,
guitar wigouts and some seriously
meaty tunes – imagine, if you will,
the hugely underrated Easyworld
jamming with Doves. Although the
crowd was typically stoic, towards
the end of the set I glanced around to
see heads nodding and feet tapping.
Under Control, despite its Strokes
aping title, was a blast of searing,
driving pop, the singer’s vocals soar-
ing over a suitably large hook.
Headway did the rock finish, then
took their gear apart themselves and
lifted it offstage. This band should
not have to hump their own amps
out of the back door – while bands
like Razorlight and the awful Jet
have line after line of column inches
praising them, gems like Headway
get two lines in the back of the Metro
in the listings section. Sadly, this is
what happens when the mainstream
music press focuses more on image
than actual ability.
Boxer Rebellion certainly had a lot
to live up to. Having only one guitar-
ist compared to Headway’s two, I
wondered how much variety there
would be in the set. Thankfully, any
preconceptions I had were complete-
ly destroyed within about 30 seconds
of the opening song. Their sound
is a based on swirling, feedbacking
guitar lines, somewhat reminiscent
of Radiohead. Where Radiohead
would insert a lengthy verse, Boxer
Rebellion insert lots and lots of
noise. Walls of noise, indeed, seem
to be their speciality. At some points,
the drummer was allowed to let rip
with some of the best drumming I’ve
heard since Oceansize – thundering
snares and tons of cymbals, sending
the songs into the same post-rock
territory.
Finishing with the utterly destruc-
tive Watermelon, which is basically
built around a two-note guitar har-
monic and evolves into a rage-filled
maelstrom, Boxer Rebellion left
me shouting for more. I can under-
stand why Alan McGee signed them
on sight – they have an incredibly
enthralling sound that draws you in
and spits you out feeling exhausted
and sweaty.

Bands! At the Union!
With very little or no advertising, Boxer Rebellion and Headway manage to take over Friday
night in dBs with their sweeping, anthemic songs
