The Fellwanderers walking
club had another success-
ful excursion this month to
Snowdonia, where we man-
aged to navigate our way up
both Snowdon and Cnicht.
Amongst some of the fin-
est scenery in the UK, we
enjoyed our cheese and pickle
sandwiches at over 2000 feet
despite the typical hailstorm
on the mountainside.
After successfully avoid-
ing the motorway for several
hours (taking instead every
side road and narrow lane
in north Wales), we arrived
at our hut. Taking only our
lunch and waterproofs the
next day, the team hiked up
Snowdon taking in some of
the most breathtaking scen-
ery the area has to offer
before retreating to the hut
in the hills. The evenings
were equally enjoyable, with
our resident chef cooking the
group dinner ahead of soak-
ing up some Tesco wine and
relaxing in front of the fire.
Sunday saw the group up
Cnicht, bearing the exclusive
Fellwanderers banner over
the hilltops after what was
an exciting scramble up the
mountain. There were fantas-
tic views and good weather
aplenty, regardless of the
choice made by our naviga-
tor to take us through muddy
bog after hidden stream after
muddy bog...
Overall, the weekend was
a great success with the
whole group coming back
tired but satisfied after see-
ing some spectacular views
(including Sarah falling over,
twice) and enjoying each oth-
er’s company.
