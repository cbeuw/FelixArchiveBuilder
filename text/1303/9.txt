Two Imperial College
Engineers Without Borders
(EWB) students, Paul Sutton
and Jignesh Parekh, have
spent their summer working
with a local non-governmen-
tal organization called the
Himalayan Light Foundation
in Nepal this year.
The organization endeav-
ours to make solar tech-
nologies accessible to the
poorest members of rural
communities using unique
micro credit loan systems
in a program called ‘HELP’.
The students were providing
technical assistance in the
installation of solar power
systems in schools and com-
munity centers in the regions
of Gorkha and Baglung, in
central Nepal.
Engineers Without Borders
is a student organisation,
founded to “help people in
developing communities gain
access to the technology and
engineering knowledge they
need to improve their lives”.
EWB sees its role as offer-
ing developed world engi-
neers – particularly students
– a comprehensive vehicle to
supply technical and human
resources to local non-gov-
ernmental organizations, to
help research, design and
implement technology that
is appropriate. Secondly,
EWB are seeking to raise
awareness and satiate curi-
osity about international
development within univer-
sities. Finally, the organiza-
tion encourages students to
partake in research projects
to develop appropriate engi-
neering solutions to develop-
ing world problems.
The geographical nature
of Nepal and long-standing
political turmoil have led to
the creation of several infra-
structural deficiencies and
challenges, one of which is
the distribution of electric-
ity. Due to the mountainous
terrain and dispersed villag-
es, it has not been economi-
cally feasible for the grid to
expand much further beyond
the cities of Kathmandu and
Pokhara, nor is any seri-
ous expansion planned for
the next ten years. This has
meant that the majority of
Nepalese rural communities
does not and will not have
any access to electricity.
However, people have begun
to respond to this problem
by adopting decentralized
micro-solar power systems.
Over the course of five years,
Nepal has seen approximate-
ly 50,000 solar systems being
installed throughout the
country, and this trend con-
tinues to gain popularity.
The Himalayan Light
Foundation has been at the
forefront of the rapid growth
of this alternative energy
source, and continues to
develop the technology to
meet the needs of Nepali
communities. In co-ordi-
nation with this organisa-
tion, the Engineers Without
Borders students were able
to pioneer computer classes
in village schools and the use
of solar power in communi-
ty factories in Baglung and
Gorkha.
You can hear more about
these students and their work
in Nepal in a talk to be given
tonight by EWB Imperial stu-
dents who have spent their
summers in different parts
of the world participating in
several development-related
projects.
● The EWB talk takes
place tonight from 6pm
in room 208 of the Civil
Engineering building.

The Samaritans: here to listen and support
It’s a cold, wet Friday night.
You’ve been dumped the pre-
vious evening. You’re strug-
gling to meet an essay dead-
line. And your flatmates are
asking for rent money you
haven’t got. You feel desper-
ate, almost overwhelmed.
You’re having despairing
feelings you’ve never experi-
enced before...
If you found yourself in
this situation, who could you
turn to at 3am? Who would
be available for you to talk
to? Where would you find a
caring listener in the mid-
dle of the night with whom
to share your feelings? Who
would want to even listen to
your problems?
There are places to go for
this kind of help, but not all of
them are available whenever
you might need them. The
Student Advice Service, the
Student Counselling Service
and Nightline all offer sup-
port, but what happens if they
are busy, or you have to make
an appointment, or it’s dur-
ing the College holidays? Who
would you turn to then?
The answer is to call
Samaritans.Thelocalnumber
is 020 7734 2800, or you can
ring the national number,
08457 90 90 90.
Samaritans provide a con-
fidential helpline that oper-
ates 24/7/365. They are there
for people in distress, going
through a crisis and think-
ing of harming themselves
or possibly taking their own
lives. But we also hope to hear
from people before they feel
close to the edge – when they
feel distressed, confused, iso-
lated, misunderstood. As one
Samaritan put it: “Our role
is to respond to anyone going
through a difficult time, feel-
ing depressed, or just strug-
gling to cope.”
What Samaritans offer is
someone to talk to, someone
who will share the burden,
someone who will listen with-
out judging. They are not
counsellors, therapists, or
advisors, just ordinary people
offering empathy and human
understanding.
“Samaritans work on the
principle that talking things
through can make it easier to
find a way out of distress. We
do not judge or give advice,
we allow people to work out
their own way forward.”
Samaritans recognise that
it is often difficult to talk
about sensitive issues or
personal traumas, and they
know that telephoning can
be painfully hard for some
callers. However, if you wish,
you don’t even have to make
verbal contact, as Samaritans
also have a confidential email
service offering support. You
can email jo@samaritans.org
and someone will respond
within 24 hours.
For students with access
to central London, there is
also a drop-in service that
operates from 9am to 9pm at
46 Marshall Street, in Soho.
This provides the opportunity
of talking to a Samaritan vol-
unteer face-to-face. Central
London Samaritans also has
volunteers who speak many
different languages, and
there is a line dedicated for
Japanese speakers on 020
7287 5493.
But, as one Samaritan
explains, “It may not be you
that is experiencing distress
or facing a crisis. It may be a
fellow student. What we hope
is that friends will pick up
signs of distress – such as
changes in patterns of behav-
iour – and let them know
about the Samaritans. That
they can call us; that we are
here to listen.”
● In Britain, more people die
every year by suicide than in
road accidents.
● Every two hours someone
in the UK succeeds in taking
his/her life.
● Two people under 25 die by
suicide every day.
● Every hour three young
people self harm.
● Many of these people are
students, struggling to cope
with the pressures of being at
college or university.
Samaritans can be con-
tacted 24 hours a day by tel-
ephone and email. You can
contact the nearest branch
to the South Kensington
campus on 020 7734 2800 or
jo@samaritans.org.

Entrepreneurs’ Challenge
Manager
The launch party for one
of the world’s biggest busi-
ness plan competitions, the
Entrepreneurs’ Challenge,
now in its fifth year, was a
great success. Over 350 stu-
dents came along to learn
how they could get involved.
Piers Robinson, Student
Business Mentor, explained
the format of the competition.
The Challenge is open to all
Imperial College students,
undergraduate and post-
graduate, and is run by the
Entrepreneurship Centre in
the Tanaka Business School.
Students do not need to have
prior business or commercial
experience to enter. Previous
winners have come from a
variety of departments.
The ‘Ideas Challenge’, the
first part of the competition,
runs this term and asks for a 2-
3 page summary of a business
idea. Ten £1,000 prizes and
ten £250 prizes are awarded
to the winners at this stage.
In the Spring term, the ‘New
Business Challenge’ offers
students the opportunity to
present a full business plan
for a chance to win the first
prize of £25,000 in cash and
services, one of two runners
up prizes of £5,000 in cash
and services, or a finalist cash
prize of £1,000.
Kindle Solutions – better
known as James Barclay,
James Arnold and Paul
Andrew, three final year
mechanical engineering stu-
dents–sharedtheirexperienc-
es of entering the Challenge
lastyear.LagerServ,withtheir
idea of a time-saving device
for pouring beer, proved to be
a very popular choice with the
students!
Successful entrepreneur
Dan Germain, one of the
founders of Innocent drinks,
provided the inspiration for
the evening. The creators of
Innocentwerethreecitywork-
ers who left their jobs in 1998
to start up a company selling
health drinks. They bought
£500 worth of fruit, turned it
into smoothies and sold them
at a music festival in London
from a stall with a big sign
above saying ‘Do you think
we should give up our jobs to
make these smoothies?’ They
put out a bin saying ‘YES’ and
a bin saying ‘NO’, and asked
people to put the empty bottle
in the right bin. At the end of
the weekend, the ‘YES’ bin
was full and Innocent, now a
company with an £18m rev-
enue, was born.
Teams who have taken
part in the Entrepreneurs’
Challenge have been suc-
cessful London-wide as well
as in international business
plan competitions, proving
Imperial’s students to be
among the best at developing
and presenting ideas. Some
have also gone on to raise
investment capital to make
their businesses a reality.
The competition attracts
companies such as McKinsey,
IBM, Psion, Shell, HP
, HSBC,
Barclays Capital, Amadeus
Capital and Innocent Drinks
to sponsor or pass on their
expertise to our students,
meaning that entrants have
a wealth of experience avail-
able to them as they put their
business plans together.
Weekly presentations take
place every Thursday 6-7pm
in LT1 of the Tanaka Business
School to support those enter-
ing the competition. These
include talks from industry
professionals on how to gen-
erate ideas, how to protect
your ideas, marketing and
developing your product,
financing your business and
how to write a business plan.
