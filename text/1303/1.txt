Following last week’s Imperial
College Union elections,
in which turnout reached a
record high but only 15 of 40
posts were filled, steps are
being taken to strengthen can-
didates’ positions against ‘Re-
Open Nominations’ (RON).
RON finished ahead of the
majority of candidates after
the votes were counted. 16
people were to be elected to
Union Council, but only five
finished ahead of RON, so
there will be a new election
for the remaining 11 places.
There will also be new elec-
tions to the Trading and Retail,
House, Services and Student
Development Committees for
similar reasons.
The situation may have been
caused by voters’ unfamiliar-
ity with the candidates, and
by the emphasis being placed
on simply voting, rather than
thinking about it first.
Sam Rorke, the Deputy
President (Education and
Welfare), told Felix that “the
Union will be taking steps to
make sure that students are
given access to all the infor-
mation they need before they
make their choice”.
The elections will be publi-
cised more widely in the stu-
dent media, including Felix,
with more information pro-
vided about the candidates
themselves. The time periods
for nominations, campaigning
and voting are likely to be
extended in order to allow stu-
dents to make “an informed
choice”.
Under the STV system, vot-
ers rank the candidates in
order of preference. In Union
elections, students are always
provided with the option of
votingtore-opennominations,
in order to express their
dissatisfaction with the
candidates and start a new
election with, in theory, an
improved list of people to vote
for. However, the prospect
of ranking 16 candidates in
order of preference did not
appeal to a large proportion of
the electorate. It is far easier
to mark a first preference and
then simply choose RON.
Students were strongly
encouraged to vote by the
large-scalepublicitycampaign
and by the ‘doughnuts for
votes’ incentive introduced by
the Union President, through
which 25p per vote would go to
a club or society of the voter’s
choice. However, they were
not encouraged to take any
more than a fleeting interest
in the candidates and may not
have realised the consequenc-
es of voting for new elections.
Voting RON was the simple
and obvious choice, a choice
that Union officers will have
to change if they are to fill
their Committee posts in the
near future.
Mustafa Arif, President
of Imperial College Union,
admitted that the prospect
of another triumph for RON
was a concern, but stressed
that “if people don’t have
confidence in those standing
for election and want to vote
RON, then that’s what they’re
entitled to do”.
Thelastnotable‘success’for
RON occurred in 1997, when it
defeated candidates for the
post of Union President on
three occasions within a peri-
od of four months.
New elections for all the
unfilled posts will take place
next month, with nomina-
tions due to open at 9am on
Monday and close on Friday
12 November. For more infor-
mation, or to stand for elec-
tion, visit www.union.ic.ac.
