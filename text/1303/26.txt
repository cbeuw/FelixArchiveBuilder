Imperial Men’s 3rd 3
King’s Men’s 2nd 2
By Hasan Iqbal
The first ULU game of the
season, and Imperial Thirds
rocked up eager to get stuck
in, having previously suffered
a narrow defeat in the BUSA
league. Aiding the cause was
the fact that the opposition
were Kings 2nds, whose cap-
tain sent Shatters a text mes-
sage at 3am the previous day
saying he only had nine play-
ers but was good for the game.
They actually arrived before
Imperial, but with a pathetic
eleven players, including a
gloveless goalkeeper. Oh yes,
the signs were good.
The game kicked off at 2pm
on a perfect, slick surface, and
quickly settled into a pattern
of Imperial dominance. All
over the pitch Imperial were
first to the ball, stronger in
the challenge and cultured on
the ball. Five in midfield with
Booth and Hideki hugging the
touchlines worked a treat,
and Imperial retained excel-
lent possession. Numerous
chances were created in the
first half, a couple falling to
John Scott, who ran onto
the ball well but appeared
to be missing his shooting
boots as the ‘keeper hung on
both times. Perhaps the best
effort that went begging fell to
Hideki who, after some lovely
slick passing, cut inside his
man to leave the goal at his
mercy, but again the King’s
keeper pulled off the save.
Frustration was starting to
set in when, just after the half
hour, Imperial won a corner,
which was delivered from the
right by Hideki. It flashed dan-
gerously across the goal and
reached a fresh air shot from
Adam before finally landing
on Caruso’s head. The ball
hit the bar, hit the ‘keeper
and went in. One-nil Imperial.
This remained the score at
half-time.
On came Leon for the
injured Adam and, ten min-
utes later, Perry for Scott. The
second half was in general a
slightly scrappier affair. While
Imperial were on top, the flu-
ency wasn’t as good as the
first half. However, as King’s
pushed forward, there were
opportunities aplenty at the
other end. About 15 minutes
into the half, probably the
best move of the game pro-
duced the second goal. Dom
played a lovely chip to Leon
who pulled the ball back by-
passing Perry to find a free
Hideki who curled the ball
into the far corner. Two-nil.
Three-nil came courtesy of
an own goal resulting from a
Perrycorner.Furtherchances
came frequently as players
tired and Perry helped him-
self to two goals. His first was
a mazy run from the half-
way line, skipping past two
players and the ‘keeper. His
second was a great turn and
shot having received the ball
from Leon.
Five-nil to Imperial, and
despite having almost noth-
ing to do, Matty pulled off a
couple of super saves during
the game to ensure the clean
sheet. Right, we’re all off to
Luton on the fun bus.

Thirds thump King’s
GKT Men’s 3rd 0
Imperial Men’s 4th 5
By Michael Nicholson
OK, it wasn’t against our own
medics, but a five-nil thrash-
ing of the medics from GKT
was still a sweet result.
There was one change from
the team that drew with RVC,
with Jai coming in up front in
place of Dave who dropped to
the bench. As usual, Imperial
made a slow start and the
speedy GKT striker was caus-
ing problems by hanging on
the last man and outpacing
the back four to balls over
the top.
Vanni produced a captain’s
performance and made
a couple of great saves to
keep things level. Imperial
though began to find their
feet, with Chris looking par-
ticularly dangerous down the
left. Their dominance began
to tell, and Jai opened his
account for the season to put
Imperial one up with a neat
left-footed finish after great
holding play from Shwin.
The second goal came from
an unlikely source when
Ed popped up in the box to
finish well after more good
work from Shwin. Chris then
bagged a deserved brace.
The final touch was added
by Ant, who had an outstand-
ing game and produced a pin-
point shot which lobbed the
‘keeper and dropped into the
right hand corner of the goal.
That makes it four points
out of six for the Fourths. Big
up the boys. Well played!

Imperial Women’s 1st 2
St Mary’s Women’s 1st 9
By Cindy Drinnan
The ladies’ first team put in a
strongeffortagainstStMary’s
and were not disappointed
with this result against a
team that has recently been
demoted from the BUSA
Premier League.
Despite losing the game, the
team did not feel outplayed.
St Mary’s seemed to rely on
a couple of strong players to
dominatetheirgame.Number
12 in particular appeared to
have borrowed Marion Jones’
legs for the day.
Our captain, Yoda, kept
up enthusiasm with help-
ful coaching from the back,
despite nearly being taken
out by a flying ball in the
first five minutes of the
game! Howard and Flush
were strong in defence, as
was Pasty. Moonie, this time
with her clothes on, worked
well on the left with Womble
and Spellcheck. Tandem
rode, I mean ran, non-stop
on the right hand side, often
getting the ball out wide to
Chardonnay, who used the
passes well.
Goal scorers for Imperial
were Embryo and Anticlimax,
who on this occasion clearly
chose not to live up to her
name. Man of the match
went to our star goalkeeper
Spanner, who put in a very
confident performance and
successfully tried out her new
diving techniques!
Stay tuned for updates on
naked hockey, which will be
brought to you by Moonie and
Tandem as a spectacular fun-
draising event.
The ladies would like to wish
a belated Happy 21st Birthday
to Tyson, and a speedy recov-
ery to her brother.

Imperial Men’s 1st 26
By Mike Hicks
For our second game of the
season, Imperial College
Union Rugby Club’s first XV
travelled away to GKT at
Cobham.
Arriving in plenty of time,
unlike last year, we were all
feeling confident of a good
performance. This showed in
the first 15 minutes when we
scored three tries, the best-
coming from Alex ‘yank tank’
O’Rourke on the wing follow-
ing some great hands in the
backs after a well worked lin-
eout (19-0).
Unfortunately, with the
game looking like it should
end in a cricket score, we
took our foot off the pedal and
allowed GKT to come back
into the match. Following
some sustained pressure on
our 22, some careless penal-
ties crept back in from last
week and suddenly they had
kicked themselves onto the
scoreboard (19-3).
With their heads now up,
GKT came at us hard and
some miscommunication at a
scrum on our own line allowed
them to score a soft try just
before half time (19-8).
After a few gentle words
of encouragement during the
break, most of which can’t be
printed here, we came out
in the second half trying to
recreate some of the magic of
the first 15 minutes.
GKT must have had the
same treatment, as they also
came out fired up, leading
to better rugby from both
teams.
During the second half,
GKT kicked another two pen-
alties to bring them within
five points (19-14). With the
pressure now on, we raised
our game again and after a
failed clearance from GKT’s
22, Higgins fed the ball to
Spencer, then Raph danced
his way through the defence
to score. The game was now
sealed at 26-14.
Man of the match went to
full back Andy Towers for
his all-round presence at the
back, while other notable per-
formances came from Peddar,
stepping into scrum half, and
the ‘yank tank’ on the wing.
Next week we face league
newcomers King’s, and going
on current form we should
easily make it three out of
three.

RVC Women’s 1st 19
Wye Women’s 1st 0
By Suzanne Horn
The warriors of Wye women’s
rugby team marched onto the
pitch on a beautiful Sunday
afternoon, but the girls were
not there to enjoy the sun-
shine – they were there to
win!
Wye played a valiant first
half, with the girls called most
of the shots after retaining
the majority of possession. An
outstanding performance by
our gutsy hooker made sure
that Wye kept the ball by win-
ning opposing scrums despite
the weight disadvantage. This
deservedly gave our hooker
‘woman of the match’.
Another forward to be men-
tioned must be Ninja, whose
blinding tackles shook the
ground and put any attack
to a quick end. Even Martin
Johnson would have winced
if he had been watching from
the touchline!
Jackie got up close and per-
sonal with one of the Vet girls,
showing them how truly tough
and brutal this side can be.
The score was nearly made
even by a storming run from
Hetts, made possible from a
lineout set move on the five
yard line, but unfortunately
the try was disallowed. Better
luck next time.
RVC’s size slowly pre-
vailed throughout the second
half, as Wye’s legs became
tired, leading to a couple of
unlucky tries being conceded.
However, this did not deter
Lil, in her first match at full
back, from nailing a critical
try saving tackle.
In spite of this, the girls will
be back here with a venge-
ance next year and will be
sure to bring along some-
thing to threaten the seagulls
in case they make a repeat
appearance. The final score
did not reflect the top class
performance presented by
the Wye team, who will be
sure to put this right next
week against GKT at home.
Particular appraisal must
go to all the forwards who
played fantastic rugby. It was
a shame that the backs were
not in the same form!
Thanks to all who put up a
great fight against the Vets,
an excellent effort, espe-
cially seeing as it was the
first match of the season.
Hopefully the home crowd
next week will inspire us to
show GKT what Wye rugby
girls are really made of.

Tries not on Wye’s side
Threes take Essex for a joy ride

Imperial Men’s 3rd 15
Essex Men’s 3rd 0
By Jon Freedman
So finally it was time for the
Threes to kick off their sea-
son, and their first victims
were the Essex Thirds.
The day started off with the
coach turning up at the Union
20 minutes late, much to Big
Dan Lindsley’s concern, but
that was the only real mis-
hap. After a long trek to Essex
and our customary ten minute
warm up/run through session
we were off. It was clear from
the start that those XR3i driv-
ers needed a lesson in rugby
and we were going to give
them one.
Imperial dominated and
steamed straight into the
Essex half, with the forwards,
who had not played together
before, working well. A try
didn’t take long to come. After
some porn star handling,
Seb K went over for our first
score. It was an unnecessar-
ily close first half with new
centre, Luke, taking pity on
the Romford rejects and con-
sistently breaking up our own
moves. However, in the sec-
ond half, his pity had gone and
he put Matty Taylor in for his
first try of the season
It was quite clear that
we were rusty after a long
summer, but somehow Matt
Bangor completely forgot that
we were playing rugby and
dribbled the ball up the pitch,
twice! Fortunately Giles and
fresher Tom hadn’t forgotten
how to tackle and completely
munched one of the Essex
players. Shrieks from the play-
er’s stiletto-wielding girlfriend
could be heard loud and clear.
Throughout the match, qual-
ity kicking from Rob Thomas
kept the pressure firmly on
Essex and a third try was
inevitable. Finally it came, in
the form of Matt Taylor again.
Hat trick avoidance was clear
on his part from then on. It
was an excellent performance
from all, especially the fresh-
ers who made an immediate
impact on the quality of our
game, the 15-0 scoreline not
reflecting our dominance.
