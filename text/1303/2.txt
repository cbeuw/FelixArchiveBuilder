The story that most domi-
nated the news last week was
the proposed re-deployment
of 650 British Black Watch
troops from Basra to Falluja,
a much more volatile area
of Iraq currently under US
control.
After the initial debate in
Parliament, interest seemed
to be dying out before a video
of hostage Margaret Hassan
was released in which she
begged Tony Blair not to
send the troops, who would
be involved in an offensive
against the city.
The problems arose firstly
when the Secretary of State
for Defence, Geoff Hoon, sug-
gested that the move was still
under debate when it had, in
fact, been confirmed already.
Secondly, many MPs, includ-
ing those who voted in favour
of going to war, were worried
about the chain of command
and whether it is wise to send
British troops into a very dan-
gerous area of the country at
a time when public opinion is
strongly in favour of bringing
them all home.
So what did the British
newspapers think of the
story?
There was widespread disa-
greement about whether the
true aim of the move was
to shore up President Bush’s
position before the up-com-
ing US elections. The idea is
that the American public is
beginning to notice that the
US is suffering over 90% of
the casualties in Iraq, and so
a high-profile redeployment
of a famous regiment would
reassure them that there
is, in fact, a coalition in
involved, rather than just US
forces.
The Observer drew par-
allels between this week’s
move and the sacrifice of
Scottish troops at Dunkirk,
pointing out that once again,
“Scottish soldiers [are] being
sent into harm’s way on an
ugly suggestion of political
expediency”.
The Times, however, argued
that to assume that sending
650 soldiers into a dangerous
area when there are already
135,000 American troops will
mollify the American public
shows either “a complete
lack of understanding of
American politics or a pat-
ronising assumption that
Americans are so stupid they
will swallow anything they
are fed”. They argue that the
move is about an election –
the Iraqi election due to take
place next year, which needs
a safe country and limited
resistance so that Bush and
Blair can chalk it up as a
success.
The Telegraph added its
voice, saying it was unlikely
that Blair was allowing the
move in order to help George
Bush, because it has hardly
been reported on at all in the
American media.
The Telegraph believes that
Blair has agreed the move
for much more dangerous
reasons – because he him-
self believes that what he is
doing is right, and that he
is doing all he can to finish
the job and secure his legacy.
The paper describes him as a
“warrior-statesman, with fire
in his eyes, determined to get
his way”.
The Mirror interviewed
soldiers’ parents who were
found to “distrust the motives
for sending their sons and
daughters into battle”.
The state of mind of the
troops was a favourite topic.
The Sun claimed that they
were proud to be involved,
quoting one who said:
“Frankly this regiment beat
Napoleon, beat the Kaiser
and it beat Hitler. For the
jocks of the Black Watch this
is just the latest chapter in
our history and just another
job to be done”.
They argued that all the
hype over moving to the ‘tri-
angle of death’ was needless
hyperbole that did nothing
except upset their families.
But then they would say
that, wouldn’t they, argues
The Observer – they need
to “crush feelings of regret
because a lack of commit-
ment could be fatal”.
The Observer also made
perhaps the most telling
point about the whole
thing: regardless of wheth-
er or not Blair did make
the decision to send the troops
in order to shore up Bush’s
support, what is most seri-
ous for the Prime Minister
is that everyone “immedi-
ately assumed that he had
an underhand reason”. Trust
in the Prime Minister, and
in his wartime decision-
making, appears to be at its
lowest ebb.
Black Watch troops move to ‘triangle of death’
Reading the newspapers so you don’t have to: Emily Gwyer looks at what the British press
said about one of the week’s biggest national news stories

Imperial College lecturer Dr
Andy Purvis became the new
World Singles tiddlywinks
champion last Friday.
Dr Purvis, who works
at Silwood Park in the
Department of Biological
Sciences, won the 59th World
Singles event at Queen’s
College, Cambridge. He beat
the former champion, Larry
Khan of the United States, by
30.33 points to 11.67.
The title of World Singles
champion is the highest
accolade in the game of tid-
dlywinks, and is played on
a challenge basis. A player
must become the National
Singles champion in order to
challenge the current world
champion to an official match,
played over seven games.
Dr Purvis first became
interested in the game 20
years ago, as a student at
Cambridge University. He
said: “It’s a brilliant game
which deserves to be taken
seriously. It is complex and
quite creative.”
Modern tiddlywinks was
invented in 1955, when the
Cambridge University
Tiddlywinks Club was formed.
However, it has roots in the
Victorian era.
Tiddlywinks is usually a
four player game, played on a
6ft by 3ft mat with a pot in the
middle. Each player has six
small counters called ‘winks’,
which are manoeuvred
around the mat using a larger
disc called a ‘squidger’. The
aim is to get all your winks
into the pot first, though this
is not as straightforward as
it may seem – advanced play-
ers use complex strategies
and tactics to ‘squop’ (block)
other players’ winks.
Dr Purvis also won the
National Singles title last
weekend.
