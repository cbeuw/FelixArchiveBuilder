Reading Women’s 1st 12
Imperial Women’s 1st 10
By Merrin Tulloch
Welcome! The Virgins are
back! And we have reinforce-
ments...
Having lost our front row
to the Scottish highlands and
Spain, we briefly considered
disbanding and reforming
as the Home Baking Society.
But instead, the Virgins
(Imperial’s women’s rugby
club, just in case any freshers
haven’t realised yet) decided
to put our talents to good use,
and our Freshers Fair fairy
cakes enticed many (unsus-
pecting) fine freshers to sign
up for some fun and rugby
action.
Last Wednesday we took
to the field for our first com-
petitive match of the season,
away to Reading in the BUSA
(British Universities Sports
Assocation) League. Last
season we lost heavily in this
fixture, so we were out for
revenge. Stinky stepped up
to fill the gap at prop, and off
we went.
The less said about the first
half the better probably, as
we lost the toss and had to
play literally uphill. Reading
kicked the ball in behind us
and kept us pinned in the bot-
tom corner of the pitch. They
found a two man overlap and
unleashed their rangy cen-
tre. 5-0.
Fantastic defence by the
new look Virgins back line
pushed Reading off of the
pitch when they continued to
attack down the wing. Killer
had some excellent crash ball
in the centre but we made
life hard for ourselves by not
using our width and speed on
the wing, remaining in our 22.
Reading used their experi-
ence in the backs and some
well executed moves in the
centre to go 10-0 up.
In the second half, and with
the slope on our side, we
fared much better. We spread
the ball wide to Whiplash,
who ran us out of our 22. It
took three of their players
to bring down our tiny back
on their 10m line. Crucially,
Whiplash mullered their 13
and main strike runner – well
done, pints for you! Gump
took the ball from the back of
the Reading scrum and went
charging off down the hill into
their 22. The following period
of forward pressure took us
over their line twice, but the
ref decided we had been held
up.
The Reading scrum half
continually tried to kick them
out of danger, but instead
sent the ball straight into the
arms of Tumbles, who ran
it back down their throats.
From a messy breakdown
in front of the posts, Flipper
found prop Tree Total on the
wing (a breach of the trade
descriptions act, surely), who
was unstoppable from 5m
out.
From the restart we
worked our way back down
to the pitch thanks to text-
book forward pick and drive,
and again spun the ball wide
to debuntant centre Udders
who brushed off three tack-
les to crash over and score
again. We then needed three
points in as many minutes for
victory but Reading weren’t
about to give up, and again
their scrum half’s fine boot
sent us back into our 22 from
where we couldn’t recover.
Ultimately we were in fine
spirits, knowing if we can pro-
duce rugby of that standard
each week we will beat every
other team in our league, and
that all our lovely freshers
are going to get even better
too! How exciting! We piled
back into the van (driven by
our new team bitch Ed – hail
to the bus driver indeed),
sang songs, and composed
a nice letter to our local MP
Michael Portillo, campaign-
ing for more piss-stops
between Reading (and for
that matter Harlington) and
South Kensington.
Finally, best of luck to
Gump who goes for England
Students trials this weekend.
Here’s hoping for an Imperial
back row showdown when
England play Scotland!
