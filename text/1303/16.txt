SINGLE REVIEWS
You would think Blinded By The
Lights would be like a really dull
anecdote. So, Mike Skinner has
gone to a club. Initially he can’t find
his friends. He indulges in some
recreational drugs. He wanders to
the foyer in an attempt to get a sig-
nal on his mobile (most probably on
T-Mobile then).
And so his evening continues,
although alas we are not treated to
his night bus antics or indeed the
journey from his front door to his
bed. But there’s something about
it. There’s a tune not unlike the
intro to Never Tear Us Apart by
the late INXS. There’s a slow, tinny
beat, plodding along in the dark-
ness. There are the hollow voices
whispering retorts to the continual
train of thought running through
the song. There’s a definite sense
that we’ve all been here, and while
it makes you a little tired just listen-
ing to it, it’s okay, because it’s just
a song.

In a startling departure from their
previous spoof-rap japery, sur-
prise success Goldie Lookin’ Chain
have produced a serious song, a
heart-breaking post-modern tear-
jerker about the emotional pain
and confusion experienced by all
concerned when a middle-aged
parent is revealed to be transgen-
dered. Typified by a subtle blend of
thoughtful melody and toe-tapping
beats, Your Mother’s Got A Penis
is wistful and inspiring by turns,
running the gamut of human senti-
ments in a roller-coaster ride that
will leave you breathless, energised
and begging for more. Awards and
critical plaudits are ensured.
Nah, I’m just yanking your chain.
Your Mother’s Got A Penis is pre-
dictably silly, poppy and puerile from
beginning to end. But it’s laugh-
out-loud funny and insanely catchy,
and therefore does its intended job
admirably. Everyone’ll love it. Go
on, sing it at the next huge, bald,
scary-looking fucker you see in the
pub. I dares you. He’ll love it too, I
swear. Safe.

Well, no hidden meanings here, but
we wouldn’t expect anything less
from those crazy Detroit disco-
punks. Nice guitar lead with a thread
of the synthetic, a racy beat, and
vocals deep and dirty as per usual.
It’s easy to imagine a crowd jump-
ing to this one, especially with the
odd finger pointing ‘hey’ or ‘yeah’
added for good measure. It’s less
easy to imagine singing along with
a serious look on your face, but then
I guess that’s the idea. It’s not going
to win any awards for innovation,
but I have no doubt it will become an
anthem in student unions across the
land. Plus, as an added bonus, the
band have made it available as a free
download at electric6.com, so what
are you waiting for? Get bopping.

A little background on this unho-
ly offering is required. Firstly, you
need to know it is nine minutes
22 seconds long, yes I said long.
Secondly, it is wholly instrumental,
apparently ‘music in the best sense’
which will ‘take hold of you’, if the
press release has anything to say
about it. Thirdly, it will be priced
at a shocking £2.50 because, in the
band’s eyes, it is worth 51 pence
more than everything else. Lastly it
is inspired by the death of founder
member Jeremy Holtom’s wife, and
if that’s not emotional blackmail, I
don’t know what is.
To prepare for the Traveller expe-
rience I would advise you to firstly
find a time machine and transport
yourself back to the 1980s. Next you
will need to find a lonely field and
get naked (with the exception a few
spuriously placed daisy chains). And
finally have a ‘feel the music, man’
moment, accompanied by some
closed-eyed dancing and possibly a
smattering of intense head nodding.
Then if you’re lucky, beings from
another planet will abduct you and
erase any trace of this odd, new-age-
but-not, hippy nonsense from your
brain. As you may have guessed, not
my bag.

Others may embrace the similarity
between FNY and certain Detroit
based bands (you know the one I
mean, the one with only two mem-
bers where incest is most definitely
best); I, however do not.
The main problem with this first
outing into the big wide world of
‘singles’ is that Hollywood Bowl
can’t really decide what it wants to
be. Stomping, yes. Chugging gui-
tars, yes. Emphatic yelling of the
word ‘hey’, yes. And yet, a 1950s
style Hawaiian Beach Boys effort
actually provides the most promis-
ing moment of the track, only to be
swiftly replaced by a section of non-
committal da-da-das.
Admittedly there is something
very smooth about bassist Emma
Richardson’s vocals, but out of the
live setting they, and many other
catchy elements, are drowned out
by the unremarkableness of it all.

I would imagine that singer-song-
writer Martin Grech is widely
unknown to most people. If you have
heard of him, it’s probably due to
his single Open Heart Zoo that was
used on a Lexus car advert – a spine-
tingling waltz with Martin’s ethe-
real swooping falsetto. His debut
album was a strange mish-mash of
Radiohead-like indie anthems, dark-
ly introverted ballads, and frankly
bizarre progressive nu-metal.
His voice is an acquired taste. Not
as powerful as, say, Matt Bellamy’s
glass-shatteringyell, it’s a bit whiney.
On this collection of acoustic guitar
songs, as a stop-gap before his new
album, his singing becomes emotive
and touchingly fragile.
Mighty Hands starts with gently
strummed and very melodic gui-
tar, developing with interesting cor-
diality. Mr Grech bemoans the fact
that he “trusted in liars, bent down
for them” before having his cloud-
scraping “oohs” superimpose over
an otherwise restrained chorus.
Gratefully Punished is discordant
and doesn’t make for easy listen-
ing, with his moans a bit over-the-
top and grating. The EP gets back
on track with Father and Mother
Figure, a much more lush and har-
monious song, with some pretty fin-
ger-picking and the help of a choir.
There’s also some instrumentation,
in the form of a tambourine, cowbell
and hand-claps.
Martin saves the best ‘til last with
the hair-raisingly delicate Freedom,
Warmth And Sincerity. A strangely
distorted piano plays in the back-
ground as he stretches his voice
to quietly sing a melody so tender
it could almost be a lullaby. The
middle of the track features him
sighing smoothly as a choir hums
gently below, and it ends with him
imploring: “Now guilt is dead, and
all is said, you are forgiven. Now it’s
a case, of sit and wait, for the saints
to come for me”.
A beautiful collection of music
overall, and obvious proof that some-
times less is more.

Since singles have been conspicious by their absence in recent weeks, here’s a big round-
up of things you’ve heard and possibly hated on the radio
Electric Six: basically, the worst fashions of the last 30 years compressed into one band. Great!
