Detective Inspector Edward
Newson, or ‘Spewsome Newson’ as
the class of ’88 would have known
him, was not very big for a police-
man. However, he has a big prob-
lem in the shape of a series of
bizarre murders that no-one else
believes are related.
Unfortunately, the size of this prob-
lem is insignificant compared to
his feelings of sexual dysfunction
and his longing for the return of
that golden decade of 1980 when,
for a fleeting week or so, he had
the attention of the most attrac-
tive girl in the school, Christine
Copperfield. While Newson was
tortured for both his height and
red hair during the ‘best days of
his life’ by his peers, the Christmas
dance of that year is one of the few
comforting memories that can dis-
tract him from his recent divorce
and his unrequited love for his ser-
geant. And of course the killer who
leaves no clues aside from a love
of pop music seems to be laugh-
ing at him too. Could his school
day reminiscing give some link to
these strange killings?
Past Mortem rollercoasters in
quality somewhat, but the overrid-
ing theme here is the way in which
it’s written. It’s trash. The verti-
cally challenged need not despair:
the plot twists aren’t tight enough
to cause a height restriction on
this ride. However, the first sex
scene may frighten some readers
back to the Disney-themed merry-
go-round.
Elton seems to think he’s keep-
ing us all in suspense by hold-
ing out the plotline until the sec-
ond half of the book. Some people
would call this pacing, and they’d
be right when referring to the final
chapters which really are page-
turners, but I quickly became tired
of Newson’s incessant pining for
Sergeant Natasha Wilkie at the
end of every chapter.
In order to make up for the appar-
ent lack of direction in the first 150
pages or so, we are treated to the
product of the writer’s brainstorm
of ‘How many different ways can
someone feasibly die?’ The first
victim literally leaks to death from
over three hundred tiny punctures
in his body, and another is flicked to
death by being very lightly bludg-
eoned hundreds of times, possibly
with a copy of the yellow pages.
This aspect should be enough to
keep most people reading, if only
out of ‘car crash curiosity’.
However, I’m sorry to say that I
was able to guess the identity of
the killer well before the end, as the
traditional series of herrings would
be more accurately described as
pastel fuchsia rather than bright
red. Unfortunately this leaves a
black comedy crime thriller that
made me neither laugh nor have
to think too hard about what was
coming next. Although the climax
of the book is much better than
the rest and perhaps even worth
the journey to get there, the over-
all trash literature theme doesn’t
make you too concerned for any
major character’s safety. But then,
you weren’t actually expecting an
unhappy ending from Ben Elton,
were you?
In short, this book really is exact-
ly what it seems, and would make
perfect holiday reading for those of
you who loved Popcorn, which won
the Crime Writer’s Association
Gold Dagger Award. While the idea
for the plot is really quite a good
one, and the book is well written
for deck chair purposes, I’m not
sure this one will be winning any
prizes. It’s sure to be a hit with
Elton’s fans though.

“...the product of the

‘How many different

It’s cricket Jim,
but not as we know it
Ladies and gentleman, Alpha Centaurians and Betelgeusians, please have your thumbs ready for the
long awaited Tertiary Phase. Who else to review it but bloody Martin Smith from Croydon?
For the benefit of the three or four
students at Imperial who somehow
aren’t already familiar with The
Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,
allow me to introduce you to the
latest, and unfortunately one of
the last, contributions of Douglas
Adams to human civilization.
Arthur Dent is one of only two
human survivors of the destruction
of planet Earth, and equipped only
with this guide book to hitchhiking
through the cosmos and few odd
companions he’s accumulated on
the way, is reluctantly cajoled into
saving the universe once again from
a fate worse than Marvin the para-
noid android’s existence. All this
without the aid of a decent cup of
tea.
Cricket could only have been
invented by the English. Not only is
it mind-numbingly dull, but to most
of the rest of the galaxy it’s actu-
ally a rather offensive reminder of
a terrible and bloody war. So when
Arthur jumps backwards in time on
a Chesterfield sofa to find The Ashes
being stolen by a team of robots
dressed in cricket whites, his dismay
is insignificant compared to the rest
of the sentient universe’s horror.
Together with Slartibartfast’s Italian
restaurant powered ship, a couple of
pan-galactic Gargleblasters and the
voice of William Franklyn as the
book, they set off on another bizarre
lap around the imagination of the
late Mr Adams.
Returning to radio once again,
The Tertiary Phase follows the third
book of the series, Life the Universe
and Everything, and in a dramatic
break with tradition actually follows
it fairly closely. Whilst the series
first appeared on the radio and then
was adapted for the book, this phase
has come into being in exactly the
opposite way, and unfortunately
in places this still shows a little.
There’s no way you can squeeze all
of the detail and little jokes of the
book into just over three hours of
radio time. Purists will be pleased
to find a lot of the content, but those
whose familiarity with the books has
sadly lapsed recently due to college
work may feel it’s all a bit rushed.
The other major point of note
here is the unavoidable absence of
Peter Jones. Nearly all the familiar
voices of the first series are here
though, and the narration handover
is done amusingly at the beginning
of the first episode in a fitting trib-
ute for the benefit of the pedantic.
Throughout, the charming ‘dead-
line induced rambling’ style of the
original radio episodes is well recre-
ated. Douglas Adams even appears
in it himself, along with entertain-
ing cameos from Fred Trueman
and Henry Blofeld for those of you
who don’t shudder at the thought
of cricket. You can also hear that
they’ve put in a lot of over time at
the lab to get the sound just right,
using some of the original music and
sounds effects, and some original
music for Marvin and the masters
of planet Krikket.
However, the real selling point
here is the twenty minutes of delet-
ed bits dotted around each episode
that you won’t have heard on Radio
4. Some of these are golden, in par-
ticular Judiciary Pagg’s extended
sentencing scene. These and oth-
ers will make the purchase worth-
while to those who have listened to
the broadcasts, especially with the
added incentive of meeting some of
the cast (see below). However, I’d
advise others to read the book first.
