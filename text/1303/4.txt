The 13th Convention on
International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES)
closed last week in Bangkok
having revised trade rules
on an eclectic mix of animals
and plants. Issues discussed
ranged from ivory to caviar,
as participants from 154 gov-
ernments fought for their
countries’ interests amongst
conservation groups repre-
senting the wildlife.
The location for the con-
vention was controversial
because of Thailand’s poor
record on wildlife crime.
Bangkok houses grotesque
animal ‘theme parks’ and
remains a hive of illegal wild-
life trade with a thriving ivory
market. Ironically, last week
the city became the location
for extensive debate on the
future of legal ivory trading.
Appropriately, the symbol
for CITES is an elephant. The
recovery of African elephant
populations over the last 10-
15 years is a CITES success
story. This year, the confer-
ence agreed to continue pro-
tecting elephants by cracking
down on unregulated domes-
tic ivory markets (particularly
in Asia), and to strengthen
law enforcement efforts to
protect the species. It was
also agreed that public aware-
ness campaigns be launched
in all African elephant range
countries, and that progress
reports be made by the end
of March 2005. In addition,
Namibia, which has a large,
stable elephant population,
had its request to sell an
annual quota of ivory reject-
ed. As an apparent appease-
ment, the southern African
country was authorized to sell
traditional ivory carvings as
tourist souvenirs.
Significantly, however, both
Namibia and South Africa,
were successful in their
request to allow the return
of black rhino trophy hunting.
Both countries will now be
able to sell hunting permits
for five male rhinos per year.
Having been obliterated in
the 1970s and ‘80s by poach-
ers, the black rhino popula-
tion remains highly endan-
gered, yet conservationists
from southern Africa believe,
somewhat paradoxically, that
allowing the hunting of old
male rhinos past breeding
condition is in the best inter-
ests of the species in the long
run.
Trophy hunting (the hunt-
ing of large animals for their
heads or skins) is big busi-
ness. A hunting safari can cost
over $300,000, so it is no sur-
prise that some hunting pack-
ages are sold in Las Vegas
casino halls. Every year many
Americans and Europeans
travel to Africa specifically
to shoot its wildlife, paying
for permits, internal flights,
taxes and accommodation.
The money that hunting gen-
erates can provide funds and
an incentive for African gov-
ernments to protect and man-
age their wildlife – if every
black rhino is worth $300,000
to Namibia, then it’s likely
that Namibian rhinos will be
well looked after.
While last week’s CITES
meeting supported this view
by allowing controlled rhino
hunting, it is not universally
popular. The Kenyan CITES
office, under pressure from a
minority of lion conservation
groups, had requested lions
be moved to an Appendix I
conservation status, thus ban-
ning any commercial trade
and making lion trophy hunt-
ingillegal.OnAppendixI,lions
would have been assigned the
same conservation status as
giant pandas, with any trade
in them illegal. The Kenyan
lion proposal, however, was
dropped on the eve of the
conference and lion hunting
will continue in Kenya.
Professor Craig Packer, the
official delegate for Tanzania
at the conference, lobbied
against the Kenyan lion
reclassification. He told Felix:
“Appendix I would imply that
lions suffer from significant
levels of international trade.
However, the primary threat
to lion populations is habi-
tat loss and problem animal
control – the extent of tro-
phy hunting is just too low to
worry about”.
Appendix II status requires
the use of CITES export per-
mits for any trade in that spe-
cies. The great white shark,
a commercially valuable spe-
cies in decline, is now pro-
tected under this legislation.
Other decisions made at the
conference include the down-
listing of the Cuban croco-
dile from Appendix I to II to
allow the Cuban government
to supply eggs and hatch-
lings to crocodile ranching
operations. The Irrawaddy
dolphin (of little value com-
mercially) has been moved
up to Appendix I. Other spe-
cies under debate were the
ramin and agarwood trees,
both of which are now pro-
tected under CITES. The cav-
iar trade will now be under
stricter control, recognizing
the threat to the sturgeon and
a sustainable caviar market.
Secretary General of
CITES, Willem Wijnstekers,
claimed: “The Bangkok con-
ference has crafted solutions
to meet particular needs of
many wildlife species that
are endangered or that could
become so if traded unsus-
tainably”, and added that the
solutions “…seek to conserve
the Earth’s rich heritage of
biological diversity while sup-
porting the sustainable devel-
opment of local communities
and national economies”.
The next CITES meeting
is likely to take place in two
years’ time, and it is hoped
that more than just 154 of
the world’s governments will
attend. While this figure is
an improvement on the 141
represented at the previous
meeting in Chile, the protec-
tion of endangered species
requires global co-operation.

The black rhino: will CITES’ decision to allow limited trophy
hunting of this endangered species help its survival?
“Trophy hunting is big
business. A hunting
safari can cost over
$300,000, so it is no
surprise that some
hunting packages are
sold in Las Vegas
casino halls”

The Science Orangutan
In a new weekly thing, we
take an irreverent humour-
based look at science. This
week we look at the con-
troversial topic of science
jokes:
The ‘functions’ joke
f(x)=6x+3 walks into a bar.
“Got any sandwiches?”
f(x)=6x+3 asks the barman.
“Sorry,” he replies, “We
don’t cater for functions”.
“Why?” asks the function.
“Cos the Sin on the door
says so!”
Noah’s Ark
The Flood is over and the ark
has landed. Noah lets all the
animals out and says: “Go
forth and multiply.”
A few months later, Noah
decides to take a stroll
and see how the animals
are doing. Everywhere he
looks, he finds baby animals.
Everyone is doing fine except
for one pair of little snakes.
“What’s the problem?” says
Noah.
“Cut down some trees and
let us live there”, say the
snakes.
Noah follows their advice.
Several more weeks pass.
Noah checks on the snakes
again. Lots of little snakes,
everybody is happy. Noah
asks, “Want to tell me how
the trees helped?”
“Certainly,” say the snakes.
“We’re adders, so we need
logs to multiply.”
Wife or mistress?
A doctor, a lawyer and a
mathematician were dis-
cussing the relative merits of
having a wife or a mistress.
The lawyer says: “For
sure a mistress is better. If
you have a wife and want a
divorce, it causes all sorts of
legal problems.”
The doctor says: “It’s bet-
ter to have a wife because
the sense of security lowers
your stress and is good for
your health.”
The mathematician says:
“You’re both wrong. It’s
best to have both so that
when the wife thinks you’re
with the mistress and the
mistress thinks you’re with
your wife – you can do some
mathematics.”
Hallowe’en and

Why do Computer Scientists

Because Oct 31 = Dec 25
There are...
There are three kinds of
mathematicians: those who
can count and those who
can’t.
There are only 10 types of
people in the world: those
who understand binary and
those who don’t.

“I read with interest James Berry’s article on organic farming in issue 1302. Many
interesting points were raised about the environmental benefits of organic farming,
for example the increased biodiversity on organic farms. However, I felt that the key
issue was not discussed: is organic farming a sustainable solution for use worldwide
in helping to feed the starving millions?
I remember reading once that to sustain a world population of 6 billion using organ-
ic farming would require virtually all of the earth’s surface to be cultivated. Therefore,
whether we like it or not, we are going to have to investigate alternative methods. If
we do not want to wash the world with pesticides then perhaps GM crops really are
the only way forward...”

“I appreciate your concerns regarding the Earth’s food production capacity to sustain
our ever-increasing global population. However, the worldwide situation was a little
bit beyond the article’s scope... Also I think it’s worth remembering that organic
farming explicitly bans the use of chemical sprays, and that the most economically
important GM crops currently used confer resistance to non-specific pesticides, such
as glyphosate. So a GM future for agriculture will almost certainly be associated with
pesticides.”
