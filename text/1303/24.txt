Hello and welcome to the new and slightly improved Coffee Break, bought to you
by the collective genius of the infamous (or soon to be) Suzy Backhouse, Squeaky
Vaughan, the Cheshire Cat and El Vino. We aim to bring a little sunshine back into your
otherwise mundane Imperial existence. Enjoy...

Guest Column: Dot
Cotton’s Sex Tips For Girls
Dot Branning (née Cotton), Albert
Square superstar, hasn’t kindly
agreed to write our first guest col-
umn of the year. Just lie back and
think of England as we expose her
many, many years of sexual wisdom.
Certain words are left to your imagi-
nation... but please try not to think
of her naked.
“Ooh, I say Pauline! The young ones
today, they’re so ill-mannered, they
have no idea of how to treat a lady
properly. My Jim, he may be ____1,
but I’m sure the good lord would
forgive him if they knew how well he
____2 my ____3. They seem to think
they know everything about ____4,
but the older generation could teach
them a thing or two. On a Sunday,
after church, there’s nothing I like
better than having Jim ____5 as I
____6 with a ____7. Of course, the
important things in relationships
are simple. You just need commu-
nication, trust and _____8. True, as
you get older the body changes, and
though I may not be quite as ____9 as
I once was, I can still ____10 with the
best the Square has to offer! After
Jim popped the question, I was wor-
ried ____11 would ____12. But our
relationship is far ____13 than that,
and when we first ____14 I knew our
marriage would last. The problem
with young people is that you have
no ____15, so it’s no wonder you
____16. Take my advice, when you
feel ____17 just think of what Jesus
said: “Come unto thee O ____18 and
let me ___19. For I am ____20 and
my ____21 is ____22” And every-
body knows Jesus was an expert in
matters of ____23. What advice can
I give to Imperial students in par-
ticular? Well first of all, you all seem
to be ____24, which is no bad thing,
so long as you ____25. I hope that’s
useful, and that one day, one of you
may get ____26. But this isn’t UCL,
so I doubt that’ll happen. Enjoy your
student days, and remember, ____31
isn’t ____27 unless you ____28.”
Did You Know...
● A person produces about half a
litre of farts a day
● Termites are the largest produc-
ers of farts
● The temperature of a fart at its
time of creation is 98.6 degrees
fahrenheit
● Farts have been clocked at 10
feet per second
● Although they wont admit it,
women fart just as much as men
● And the members of certain
sports teams fart even more...
Before joining Imperial and becom-
ing Deputy President of Something
Not Very Important, Uncle Sam had
a moderately successful Hollywood
movie career.
We can’t let his fine achievements
go unnoticed any longer. Below is
a selection of his greatest work.
Being the shy and retiring type,
Sam declined actually appearing in
the films and was replaced. But who
eventually starred in these roles,
and what films are they from?
Hello, and welcome to the first appearance
of this corner! Characteristically grinning,
the Cheshire cat invites you to try a differ-
ent puzzle each week. Unless you are suc-
cessful, you are likely to witness the rather
unusual sight of a grin without a cat.
No.1: Not Enigma Variations
This week’s puzzle is a not-so-simple cryptogram to challenge all the
budding cryptanalysts out there among you. The quotation is encrypted
using its author’s name in a certain well-known way. As a hint, I may
divulge the fact that the author of the quotation and the original inven-
tor of the cipher were contemporaries. Good luck!
