ACQUIRE new skills in November
Your rights at work
At the moment, if you’re a fresher,
I bet you’re enjoying yourself.
You’ve got your student loan
cheque, you’ve just bought some
new clothes and you’re feeling great.
You’ve had a few nights out and
paid to join a society, everything
is new and you are enjoying your
experience.
Fast forward a few weeks and it is
a whole different picture: you’ve had
too many nights out, your landlord is
expecting his/her first rent cheque
and you’ve spent way too much of
your loan on luxury items.
If this turns out to be you, you may
well need to supplement your stu-
dent loan with a part-time job, and
so the following information might
be useful.
If you’re a working student, chanc-
es are you’re:
● desperate for cash
● working long, probably anti-social
hours for low pay
● stressed and tired through jug-
gling work and studies
● being exploited by your boss just
because you’re a student
● worried about bullying and har-
assment in your workplace
● not clear about your rights at
work and may even think you can’t
join a union.
All of this means work is bad for
you, your studies and your health.
But it doesn’t have to be. Three
quarters of students now work to
try to make ends meet. Working stu-
dents experience similar problems
and organisations such as the TUC
are campaigning for a better deal.
You have rights which can help
improve your working conditions
and protect you from danger and
discrimination whatever your boss
says. In fact, new laws mean that in
addition to your basic rights, things
have just got better for all working
people, including part-timers, temps
and casuals.
You can join a union to get advice
and support at work when you
need it and to win a better deal
in your workplace. The majority of
students are not in unionised work-
places and are not members of
unions. This means you’re likely to
be worse off than most other work-
ers and more open to exploitation.
But you have just as much right to
join a union as everyone else, what-
ever your job. In fact, given the kind
of work you do and the attitude of
employers to young/casual workers,
you’re more likely to need a union
than most.
If you have any queries relating to
this article or would like information
on your rights at work please contact

November is training month!
Imperial College Union training
offers you the opportunity to learn
new skills, improve upon those that
you already have and gain knowl-
edge in new areas. For this reason
we have designated November as
the month to “ACQUIRE” new skills
by offering a variety of training ses-
sions free to all Imperial students.
Previously, although the Union
offered training, it has not been
widely taken up, despite being a
development opportunity that we
are able to offer students. This year,
a full list of training sessions is avail-
able on noticeboards in the Union
building and in the East Wing base-
ment of Beit Quad. To book a place,
you will need to come to the Student
Activities Centre in the East Wing
basement.
If places run out then we will have
a waiting list system and possibly
put on extra sessions if there suffi-
cient demand. Although the sessions
are free, we do require you to give a
£10 deposit which will be refunded
to you on the day of the session. As
spaces are limited, this is to ensure
that those signed up do take their
places. Training sessions are either
in the evening, on Wednesday after-
noons or during lunchtimes (please
see timetable for further details),
which we hope will fit in with your
College day.
The training sessions include
those by the Imperial Volunteer
Centre, sessions specifically geared
to academic representatives, and a
variety of personal advice, training
and club and society opportunities.
Included in club and society train-
ing (more information on which can
be sought from your CSC chair or
Faculty Union president), we will be
running sessions about organising
events. This will cover budgeting
and other financial issues through
to advice about planning and prepa-
ration and how the Union can assist
with such events. We hope that this
will be particularly good both for
those who have had little experi-
ence in organising events for their
clubs as well as those who wish to
improve on previous years.
Another key session for clubs
and societies is sponsorship, where
clubs will be given advice about the
best ways to gain support for their
activities, how to go about doing this,
which organisations to target and
how it can benefit them. During the
session, clubs will meet the Union’s
marketing manager who, with her
knowledge of the area, is going to
be increasingly available to assist
clubs and societies in all aspects of
sponsorship and marketing.
There will also be a variety of
personal development sessions cov-
ering public speaking, stress man-
agement, assertiveness and time
management. These are all impor-
tant areas and perfect opportunities
to develop yourself and learn new
skills.
The Union Advice Service will be
offering advice sessions such as
coping with debt – regrettably an
essential one for students!
So do take the opportunity to take
advantage of the training sessions
available, and ACQUIRE some new
skills.

Imperial College is often referred
to as a “research-led” university.
Undergraduates are told in lengthy
sermons (which usually also remind
us that Imperial is a “world-class
institution”) that this has a direct,
beneficial effect on the quality of
our teaching, and that we should be
eternally grateful. But has anyone
stopped to think about what this
means?
Essentially, the people who teach
us are primarily here to research,
and, from the benefit of their
accrued wisdom in their chosen
field, they lecture us. They don’t, of
course, undertake this sterling work
by themselves – they are assisted
by over 2,000 PhD students. This
is one type of postgraduate study;
the other is the taught Masters and
there are slightly more of these.
Between them, they make up over a
third of our student body.
One of the Union’s primary aims
is to represent our students to the
College and to external bodies.
Currently, I believe we are doing
that pretty well in the undergradu-
ate world. We have a well-estab-
lished system of representatives
at year, department, Faculty Union
and Imperial College Union levels,
with clearly defined formal report-
ing structures to ensure the effec-
tive flow of communication. OK, it
isn’t perfect, but it works. However,
in the postgraduate world, things
don’t always work so well. It appears
that, whilst representation is work-
ing well at a local level, the networks
are not in place in the same way as
they are for undergraduate reps.
What this means in effect is that
the Union is being asked to repre-
sent the views of certain groups of
students to important College meet-
ings, where decisions concerning
the future of courses are taken, and
we are not always able to do that
effectively. I am going to change
that.
Firstly, though, let’s have a look
at life as a postgrad at Imperial
College. It can be (I am told) quite
a lonely existence, particularly for
those students who have not been
here before, and who therefore do
not know how to access the lively
social life we can enjoy. Research
students do not always start in
October and will therefore not get
a proper induction; postgrads are
often neglected by their departmen-
tal societies and Faculty Unions,
which tend to be mostly run by
undergrads. For Masters students,
at least they attend lectures (some-
times at the same time as under-
grads), whereas research students
can sometimes feel quite isolated,
spending most of their lives in their
labs then going home at the end of
the day. They are not always aware,
for example, of the huge range of
clubs and societies that the Union
offers to make life more interesting,
or about the range of bars and meet-
ing places around College. At the
end of the day, it takes two to tango
and, whilst we are trying to reach
out to all our students, you can take
a horse to water but you can’t make
it drink.
So, what is my point? Well, I
believe that if we engaged more
postgraduates in student activities,
they may begin to get more involved
with the whole issue of representa-
tion, which, as I have pointed out, I
am most keen to address.
But perhaps I am being naïve.
Maybe postgrads think of repre-
sentation in terms of complaining
about lecturers’ poor handwriting
or incomprehensible accent, as
is often the case for undergrads.
Well, postgraduate representation
could be more than that – maybe
you would like more input into the
sorts of training and personal devel-
opment you are offered, perhaps
to better prepare you for confer-
ences? Perhaps you see the job of
the rep as a conduit of information
between you and the College, letting
you know about interesting events,
important facts, or exciting oppor-
tunities? Well, either way, if you feel
underrepresented at the moment,
then say something! If you have
a rep, let them know! If you don’t,
tell me!
There are many challenges that
we are going to have to address, but
I need your help – I have not been a
postgraduate at Imperial, so I need
all the insight I can get into how to
solve the question of postgraduate
involvement with the Union. To this
end, I shall be gathering together
people with experience in represen-
tation, so that we can find the way
forward. If you have any sugges-
tions, please get in touch.
