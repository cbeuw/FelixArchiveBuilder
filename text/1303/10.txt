Yes that’s right, ‘part two’.
Despite not having any fresh-
ers here at Silwood Park, we
still celebrate the start of a
new year and a new intake.
Following on from the first
week, the second had a lot to
live up to, and proved itself
to be no less entertaining
for both those partaking and
those who got to hear the
stories and gossip which will
no doubt be engraved into
Silwood legend.
The ever-popular Silwood
pub quiz got the week rolling.
Arranged by the event team,
it was left a tad late to struc-
ture and come up with some
half descent questions, but we
ploughed through and despite
having to rely on a few dona-
tions from our tutees, who
we were teaching earlier that
day, we managed to plug the
gaps in the evening’s plan.
Taken seriously by some,
but more often not by most,
it was a chance to show off
all that random information
stored in your head that you
thought would never come in
use again, we have all been
there. With questions rang-
ing from the rather distaste-
fully answered “according to
Michael Jackson, it doesn’t
matter if... what” (the answer
was ‘black or White’) to the
surprisingly heated discus-
sions over naming the seven
dwarfs, it was a night enjoyed
by all.
Following on from this,
the international food night
proved to supply more dish-
es than I think I ate in my
first year here let alone in
one night. With mountains
remaining, it was to sup-
ply many a kitchen for the
remainder of the week.
With the beerientering can-
celled on the Thursday due to
appalling weather (welcome
to the UK, for those on their
first trip), it was Wednesday
which provided the memora-
ble night of the week. What in
theory was a fairly quiet night
into Bracknell to the bowl-
plex turned out to be a night
of yet more alcohol-induced
(at least I hope it was) re-
writing of Silwood legend.
The final result was us being
asked to leave, and we may
not return for a while.
It all came about due to us
not being able to find balls
of the correct weight and so
having to resort to human
bowling. This proved to be
more accurate than using
the balls, as apparently you
are allowed to knock down
as many balls as you wish
when you reach the other end
and so this had exponential
effects on the scores of these
participating lanes. I would
like to point out here that I do
not endorse this behaviour,
however I can understand
that from the point of view
of a technically challenged
bowler, ie someone rubbish
(which I admit to be), it is
very easy to give in to temp-
tation in order to improve
your score.
The week was rounded off
by a typical Silwood party,
with the return of last years
two resident DJs, as we
crammed the entire popula-
tion into a tiny room and then
bounced around until around
4.30am (although if Silwood
security are reading, it was
2am as we agreed, honest).
A fantastic finale to a
fortnight enjoyed by all,
new and old, at campuses
all over the Imperial world.
Congratulations to all those
involved.

Silwood Freshers Fortnight: part two

at the Wye campus
Friday night saw the annual
‘Olantigh Road’ event in Wye.
This is the Union Executive
Committee’s handover
event, Olantigh Road being
the Road to the Wye Union
building.
Tradition dictates that as
the old executive decorate
the hall, knowing that the
new exec will have to clear
it away, they take full advan-
tage of this arrangement, and
this year was no exception.
The chosen theme was
‘The Grand National’, com-
plete with a miniature race
course in the sports hall.
According to a blackboard
in the entrance, the build-
ing contained 20 tons of bark
chippings, four tons of sand,
10 bails of straw, four bags of
sawdust, 32 square metres of
turf and various other items
including 10 tyres and three
trees. Those who spent the
weekend with shovels and
wheelbarrows gradually
started to believe those fig-
ures, although fortunately
(being in Wye) one of the
new exec was able to bring
his tractor.
Following the handover, the
first major event to be organ-
ised by the new Wye College
Union Society (WCUS) offic-
ers is Wye’s annual Charity
Week, for which a shameless
plug now follows:
The week kicks off on
Sunday 31 October, with a
Hallowe’en party.
Monday sees a new addi-
tion to the traditional events,
in the form of an interna-
tional culture night hosted
by Wye’s Overseas Students
Organisation, with interna-
tional music (including live
music), food and films.
Tuesday returns to the tra-
ditional calendar, with the
infamous champagne break-
fast. Guests turn up at the
crack of dawn, with black tie
dress code, for a breakfast
that includes a whole bottle
of bubbly at a mystery loca-
tion. Only two people in Wye,
myself not included, know
the location in advance, but
recent locations have includ-
ed a racecourse, a submarine
(in dry dock), a dry sledg-
ing run and a “diggerland”
theme park.
In the evening, there is
another new addition to the
week. DJ Benjy presents
‘The Shake Down’, the event
formerly known as Urban
Night, with R’n’B, hip-hop,
garage and dancehall tracks,
and a chance for budding
vocal artists to do their thing
with an open mic session.
Wednesday sees another
old favourite, with a disco
hosted by the Meteorological
Society, also known as the
Druids, at an undisclosed
location which has previ-
ously included a barn and a
disused chalk quarry. This is
followed on Thursday by the
slave auction, a chance to
buy yourself a fresher or two,
as well being the only chance
to buy back any property
that may have mysteriously
vanished from students’ bed-
rooms earlier in the week.
Friday sees the Charity
Ball. The theme is 007, with
costumes (agents, bond
girls or villains) encouraged,
but black tie dress is also
acceptable. The location will
be announced soon, but it
certainly promises to be a
grander occasion than this
year’s Freshers’ Ball.
The week culminates
with the Bonfire Party on
Saturday, where students
and villagers join together in
a torch-lit procession up to
the Crown (the highest field
on the Wye College Estate)
for Guy Fawkes celebrations.
The week reflects incoming
WCUS President Dawinder
Sahota’s election pledge to
“combine the traditional Wye
College events in the Union
with events that reflect the
more diverse and interna-
tional nature of some of the
students here.”
Last Monday, the Wye
Postgraduate Association
elected their new President,
completing the new set of
officers, so students can
expect new plans to be
underway soon. Watch this
space...
