My London felix@ic.ac.uk
My... places to eat
Giraffe, High Street Kensington – Toblerone cheese-
cake and great smoothies. Life is complete.
Cafe Forum, Gloucester Road – Great for mass orders
of pizza because they give you little bits of paper from
which you choose your toppings for each pizza. Also
there’s a cool little machine that cuts up oranges and
squeezes them to make fresh orange juice.
Any Heathrow Arrivals Terminal – I really hate air-
craft food.
My... places to drink
Reynolds Bar – Because medics are people too! (And
it’s close by.)
Coffee Republic, Gloucester Road – Because I have to
be feeling pretty lazy to put up with Starbucks and I’ve
been converted from coffee to hot chocolate.
The Union Bar – Where else can you find such a won-
derful, smart, good looking group as people such as
Dramsoc?
My... buildings
The Empress State – Can be very pretty in a good
light.
The church in the middle of Hammersmith – Nicely
lit at night and an island of history in amongst the all
modern chaos.
Natural History Museum – Just huge and beautiful.
My... buildings to bomb
That one in Notting Hill – I think you know which I
mean. Though I understand it’s actually a listed build-
ing.
The silly-egg shaped one in Hammersmith – Though
if London is ever flooded I know which building is most
likely to float (or we could all pile into the ‘gherkin’ and
blast off)
The Home Office – Just kidding Mr Blunkett.
My... tube stations
Mornington Crescent – Because I always win at
Ambridge Hold’em.
Earl’s Court – Because it’s home.
Westminster – It has really great architecture. I’ll usu-
ally plan tube trips to change at Westminster because
I like walking though it so much. The ‘moon base’ feel
mightn’t be to everyone’s tastes, however.
My... wastes of time
Skipping – Usually to the great embarrassment of poor
Sara.
‘Working’ – Setting up and striking a never-ending
series of events around College for Dramsoc.
Heckling at Speaker’s Corner on a Sunday afternoon
– don’t bother with the religious ones because they’re
preaching, not speaking. Find the weirdos and demolish
their arguments in front of all everyone else. Repeat.
