Alfie likes to play it cool. He’s a
slick operator who spends his days
chasing after a series of glamorous
women who cross his path during
his daily adventures in Manhattan.
An Englishman abroad, Alfie, played
by Jude Law, is a charming and affa-
ble character who manages to woo
women back to his “humble digs”
through his good looks, fashionable
attire and cheeky smile.
The film is amusing, if somewhat
shallow in terms of plot and char-
acter development, but manages to
please the audience with its beauti-
ful shots of New York, coupled with
its pretty women – Sienna Miller,
Marisa Tomei and Susan Sarandon
amongst others. Alfie takes it upon
himself to learn a new word every
day, from ‘ironic’ to ‘plethora’, which
does indeed describe his love life
and his altogether hedonistic exist-
ence.
Alfie tells the story of a woman-
iser who is afraid of commitment,
who unashamedly moves from one
woman to another and seems to
use various women for his differ-
ing needs. Nicky, played by Sienna
Miller (who made her film debut
recently in Layer Cake) takes the
role of the party-girl; Marisa Tomei
plays the little wife-like girl provid-
ing the home-cooked dinners and
family warmth; and Susan Sarandon,
who plays a fifty-something Mrs
Robinson-esque lover, combines sex
appeal with humour. Indeed, one of
the most amusing parts of the film
is the scene where Sarandon, after
giving Law a rather strong cocktail,
tells him that “absinthe makes the
heart grow fonder!”
Alfie is quite a little philosopher
and makes clear to us his views
on the dangers of women, saying
that “if they don’t get you one way
they get you another”. One thinks
that perhaps Alfie’s word of the day
should be ‘philanderer’, albeit in the
most gentlemanly of ways.
At one point Alfie seems to have
decided on changing his ways and
tells us that he has made a New
Year’s resolution with regard to
women, but then it turns out that
his new resolution is simply to “aim
higher”, rather than anything more
ethically sound. Invariably, there is
a moral message at the end with
Alfie’s descent into misery show-
ing that there is a price to pay for
such a responsibility-free, reckless
lifestyle, but one wonders how much
that it is to do with Hollywood’s dis-
like of the ‘bad’ guy, or in this case
the ‘naughty’ guy, getting away with
it than anything else.
Alfie is a remake of the 1966 origi-
nal that had Michael Caine acting as
the working class tough-guy hero.
The director of the remake, Charles
Shyer, has decided to change Alfie’s
character to fit in with a more 21st
century reality, with Jude Law being
more home-counties than East End,
more cheeky than sleazy and more
like someone from Friends than a
rough cockney biker type. However,
it works well and while some points
are clearly unbelievable, like Alfie’s
designer wardrobe which he could ill
afford on his wages as a limo-cum-
taxi driver, overall the story retains
a certain charm and humour.
While the film does have some
serious, almost melancholy scenes,
it would not be unfair to call it
comic with a few real gems
including the scene where Alfie
gets his nether parts checked and
poked at by a rather camp German
doctor by the name of Miranda.
The film is funny, enjoyable,
stylish and worth spending your
precious 103 minutes of freedom on.
If nothing else, the soundtrack
performed by Mick Jagger should
entertain the more musically mind-
ed amongst you.

Whose side will you choose?
It has been a long time coming, but
finally the film that has been noth-
ing but an elusive dream for many a
gaming, comic book and film fan has
arrived. Alien vs Predator (AVP) is
now on our screens.
At long last, the two greatest hor-
ror sci-fi titans – the acid-blooded,
animalistic aliens and the brutal,
merciless predators – have been
brought together to battle it out for
the ultimate prize: Earth.
Set in the 21st century, the story
tells of the ever present Weyland
Corporation and its founder Charles
Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discov-
ering an ancient pyramid below
the ice of an isolated Arctic island.
Wanting to discover more, Weyland
takes a team of scientists out into
the frozen wastes. The pyramid,
however, turns out to be a battle
ground where every 100 years two
menacing alien races meet to wage
war. Of course, when the unsuspect-
ing humans arrive they are caught
in the middle of a deadly battle and
have to pick a side knowing that vic-
tory for either could ultimately lead
to the demise of the whole planet’s
population.
Now this film requires no prior
knowledge of either the aliens or
the predators, which is good in some
ways because it means that it can be
watched by anyone with a penchant
for horror/sci-fi/fantasy/action. For
those of us who would like to be
reminded a little bit, here’s a quick
history: the aliens first appeared
on the big screen in Alien in 1979
when they battled against Ellen
Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) to make
it back to Earth and colonise it.
Using humans as incubators for
their young and/or food, they were
seemingly invincible and kept com-
ing back, appearing in subsequent
films Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien
Resurrection. With acid for blood
and two heads, these aliens were
the stuff nightmares.
The predators, on the other
hand are a more civilised race of
man hunters, killing for pleasure
rather than necessity and col-
lecting human skulls as trophies.
They met their match, however, in
Arnold Schwarzenegger in a South
American jungle in Predator and
were fought by a resistant Danny
Glover in Predator 2.
So how does this film measure
up to the spirit of both these well
known franchises? In keeping with
the Alien theme there is a kick-
ass female, Alexa Woods (Sanaa
Lathan) who leads the survivors
out of danger, as well as a familiar
face from three of the four previ-
ous Alien films, Henriksen (former-
ly the android Bishop) appearing
as Weyland. The film also expands
on the knowledge of the predator
race, as we see their capabilities
as the ultimate hunters tested by
their hunting the ultimate prey, the
aliens.
Now AVP is not the kind of movie
that relies on its background story
or its witty and intense dialogue.
Instead it’s comprised of action, a
bit of gore and some fluorescent
blood. If that’s what you’re looking
for, all packaged nicely into a neat
hour and a half, then it’s not a bad
film.
Directed by Paul S Anderson, who
brought us Event Horizon, Soldier
and Resident Evil, it lacks a bit of
basic credibility, but then most hor-
ror films do. The special effects are
more than adequate – they’re actu-
ally awesome – and the cataclys-
mic battles between the aliens and
the predators are definitely worth
watching.
All in all, it’s not going to win any
Oscars but it is exactly what its
says on the tin – Alien vs Predator
– and that will definitely please a lot
of people.
