CLUB REVIEW
Cargo is possibly a club that has
escaped your attention thus far.
Tucked away in the depths of
Shoreditch, on the opposite side of
town to Imperial, it is a bit of a
mission to get to, but it’s only a
five minute walk once you get to
Liverpool Street. Just off Shoreditch
High Street and under the arches,
you might at first get the impression
that this is going to be one of those
dingy squat-type places, where
décor and style are sacrificed for
sub-culture and sweat. Not so here,
though – the entrance has a nice
glass door, the security are civil, and
the queuing clubbers are stylishly
attired.
These days, the East End is home
to a plethora of upmarket bars and
clubs, and Cargo is one of the main-
stays of this scene. Inside, rather
than bare walls and a large stack
of speakers in the corner, you’ll find
bars selling double-sized bottles of
Budvar, tables, seating, and handy
shelves to put your empties on.
Whilst not huge, Cargo holds several
hundred. Like many clubs, the place
has expanded on the club/bar format
and now has a restaurant too.
When we arrived, the DJ on stage
was spinning a nice enough, but not
captivating, selection of hip-hop. As
the night moved on, he picked up the
pace a bit with some pretty impres-
sive scratching over a few tracks,
plus some very cool beat juggling,
which always fascinates me (mix-
ing two identical records, alternately
pulling each one back to repeat and
remix the track and create some
unique beats).
The headliner tonight was Rahzel,
‘the undisputed beatbox champion
of the world’. For those of you that
don’t know, beatboxing is the art of
making (hip-hop) music with your
mouth. This might make you think of
your mates in primary school mak-
ing drum noises in a kind of ‘pht, ch,
pht pht, ch’ fashion, but Rahzel is
leagues ahead of this. By the time he
arrived, the place was pretty packed,
and quite rightly so. Appearing on
stage with DJ JS1, he started the
show with a track he’s made with
Roni Size, Out Of Breath. Now, to
hear someone make a drum and
bass beat with his mouth is remark-
able. To hear someone reproduce an
entire track is astounding. Rahzel’s
vocal ability means he can create
beats, bass, plus vocals, scratches
and other sounds, all at the same
time, and make them sound bet-
ter than the original. He can hum
a resounding bassline, penetrating
drums, and it’s little wonder that
some people think he cheats by
using sound samples.
Further into the show, Rahzel
showcased his talent even more with
a battle against JS1. The DJ played a
recent, big hip hop tune, then Rahzel
gave it some pantomime style audi-
ence participation: “Anything JS can
do, I can do better,” “No you can’t”
“Yes I can…” Ahem.
An artist this big can get away
with stuff like that though, and the
crowd were more than willing to join
in. How right he was – every track
the DJ laid down, Rahzel would take
and reproduce in his own style – this
means a more bumping beat, fatter
bass-line, and whatever interpreta-
tion of the vocals and melody he
could incorporate.
This really is an aural marvel.
Whilst there are, no doubt, others
that do a similar thing, this guy
really is the champ. I have a feeling
that part of the sound is to do with
having his mic whacked up as high
as it’ll go – if you listen to him on
record there’s no comparison. This
is definitely something you should
experience live, if for nothing else
then just the spectacle of his mouth.
The night was a pleasure, with only
a few negatives. Firstly, the entrance
fee is a lot of money for one main
act that you only see for a couple
of hours, especially on a Thursday
night. The camp audience partici-
pation did make me cringe a little,
though it’s not really a big issue as
it was part of the show. Lastly, whilst
having big bottles of beer is a nice (if
pocket emptying) change, it’s not so
nice when the bottles end up shat-
tered all over the floor. By the end of
the night I had shards stuck in the
soles of my shoes – not a pleasant
feeling.
These issues aside, Cargo is a very
cool venue, and Rahzel is definitely
at the top of his game – well worth
the expedition across London.

CLUB REVIEW
If you caught last week’s feature on
Fabric’s birthday, you’ll have an idea
of how vast the place is. Last week-
end I experienced this in a whole
new light, as when I arrived the
place was mostly empty. It hadn’t
opened yet, and the place looked
even more vast than when it’s
jam-packed with sweaty clubbers.
Floodlights were on; people were
scurrying around and soundcheck-
ing the lovely big sound system.
Normally I wouldn’t have arrived
until about midnight, but tonight I’d
come early to catch the first DJ of
the night, Macpherson.
It might not sound particularly
impressive to have a warm-up set,
but you have to realise that this is
actually quite a big achievement.
Firstly, consider that Fabric really is
a very good, very popular and very
big club. They really can pick and
choose where artists are concerned.
Also, it’s becoming more and more
the case these days that ‘every-
one’s a DJ’. As club culture grows
and equipment becomes cheaper,
there’s no shortage of DJs around,
especially in the world of drum and
bass.
When Macpherson started his
set at 9.30pm there was literally a
handful of people in the vast open
expanse of Room Two, but that didn’t
mean there was no-one dancing.
Macpherson’s style is fast, switching
beats between tracks so quickly that
he easily gets through 25 records for
every hour he plays. This is great
with drum and bass – the drums
never stay the same for long, and
each rolling, bouncing bassline is
quickly superceded by the next.
Playing for only the first couple
of hours, Macpherson’s crowd was
never going to be massive – the pubs
hadn’t even chucked out yet – but as
his set progressed the club gradu-
ally filled up. I have to confess that
I’m not a real drum and bass head
like some, but it was easy to tell he
was hitting the spot. Hoody-and-cap-
adorned ravers were bouncing and
jiggling, and the screams and shouts
in the breakdowns and at the end of
his set said it all. When he left the
booth, as Teebee came on, the room
was more or less full (if not totally
rammed) and the crowd was more
than just warmed up.
I hung around in Room Two
for a while and had a drink with
Macpherson to congratulate him
on his set. Teebee’s set was a fair
amount heavier than the music
before, and the MC was getting a
lot more involved. The big fat laser
was on, and the crowd was getting
more packed and more sweaty. As
I said, drum and bass isn’t my first
passion in dance music, so I went off
to check out the other rooms.
FabricLive is generally home to
beat-led music, and tonight Room
One was host to hip-hop, with the
stage occupied by an MC working
the crowd. Having spent the past
few hours getting shaken up by some
breakneck drum and bass, it was a
bit to slow for me so I headed up to
Room Three, in time for Bedrock
Breaks DJ Meat Katie. I don’t know
where the Katie part of the name
comes from, since Meat Katie is
actually a bloke, but I can tell you all
about the meat. This guy has some
immense records, and the place
was positively jumping. His sound is
chunky, funky but tough breaks, and
relatively housey. It’s almost like the
best of both worlds, with breakbeats
leading the swelling. This was really
my thing, and I spent a large part of
the night here.
Stopping back into Room Two
later, I was greeted by the sounds
of The DJ & The Drummer. This is
exactly what it says on the tin, and
it makes for a striking performance.
With the crazy sampled and sped up
drums usually found in drum and
bass, I wouldn’t expect many drum-
mers could come close to imitating
some of the beats, but this guy rat-
tled through the maddest of breaks
with ease.
Overall this was another cracking
night out, and I have to congratulate
Macpherson not just for getting a
set at Fabric, but for pulling it off so
well. Keep your eyes out for him in
the future (he’s also bar resident at
Movement), and remember where
you heard it first!
