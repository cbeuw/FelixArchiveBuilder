By Michelle Maloney
The match was held at
Roedean School, on a field
on a cliff overlooking the
sea. Very Mallory Towers.
Unfortunately the repeated
lack of half time oranges
slightly dulled the Blyton-
esque feel of the day.
It was a really close match
and so I am going to fly
through the report to the
start of the fourth quarter,
where it got terribly exciting.
Really, really, pant-wetting
stuff.
The last quarter started
9-9. We had some sneaky
draw tactics going on that
Brighton completely failed
to respond to. Lizzie would
‘lose’ the draw, feeding the
ball directly to an Imperial
player. Which was really
rather handy. Tiffany and
Hannah then stormed up
the right wing with the ball,
and the majority of play
was around Brighton’s goal.
On her debut as an attack,
down the wrong end of pitch,
Shivani managed to score a
cracking goal. But Imperial
then slipped a little and
allowed the Brighton centre
to charge straight down the
pitch and score. So, 10 each.
More sneaky drawing and
the ball was once again being
passed around the Brighton
goal. For a while, Imperial
looked a little nervy with
some dropped passes and
frantic tackling, but we pulled
ourselves together and play
picked up. Ally was having
a cracking game picking up
loose balls behind goal and
feeding them into the dream
team of Caroline and Hannah.
Hannah had ‘umpteen’ shots
on goal and proved that if you
bang away for long enough
then something is going to
happen when she scored a
good ‘un to bring us in front
again.
Back to the draw, and an
Imperial cock-up allowed
the Brighton captain to get a
clear run to goal. Superstar
goalie Lyndsey saved the
shot but then slipped and
fell, leaving Brighton with an
easy chance that they didn’t
waste.
Five minutes were left and
we didn’t want to be going
home without the win we
deserved. Caroline kept
pushing and pushing through
the wall of defenders in the
fan and was rewarded with
a goal. All we had to do was
hang on. And hang on we
did.
At the final whistle we were
all very happy little Lacrosse
players. Then it all went pear
shaped. The Umpire called
the final score as 12-12. None
of us know how on earth this
can have happened. Brighton
were arses and claimed igno-
rance or “it’s whatever the
umpire says”. Our appeals
fell on deaf ears and it seems
like we are stuck with the
result. Bugger. Although, fish
and chips by the sea followed
with turbo shandies did
help to restore our spirits a
little.
Last word: in the tourna-
ment on Saturday, which is
never to be mentioned again,
Samantha Jayaweera gets
man of the match. Truly gutsy
play, young lady. Thanks to
everyone who made it. Black
stars to the rest of you los-
ers.
