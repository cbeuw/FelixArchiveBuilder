He is a nuisance, his work is delib-
erately off-putting, and as he says
himself, he can hardly stand to be
around it for long, but Bruce Nauman
has become the most influential
American artist of his generation.
And it is now for you to judge at the
Tate Modern.
Raw Materials, by Nauman, is
Unilever’s fifth Turbine Hall project
and is a sound piece. And indeed
how better to fill that vast cavernous
space than with sounds and noise
that are bound to take on a whole
new meaning as they reverberate
around the emptiness of the hall. Let
us give you a taste of it:
“Thank you thank you thank you
thank you...”, “Think think think
think think...”, “Live and die, die and
die; shit and die, piss and die... fail
and live, smile and live, think and
live, pay and live...” and as another
phrase goes: “You may not want to
be here, you may not want to be
here...”
If you haven’t gone crazy yet, and
you do actually want to be here, then
read on.
Born in Indiana, USA, in 1941,
Bruce Nauman studied mathemat-
ics, and soon after graduating had a
major profound realization that “if I
was an artist and I was in the studio,
then whatever I was doing in the
studio must be art. At this point, art
became more of an activity and less
of a product”. Hmm...
From this point, Nauman concen-
trated less on the development of a
characteristic style and more on the
way in which a process or activity
can transform or become a work of
art. A survey of his output dem-
onstrates the alternately political,
prosaic, spiritual and crass methods
by which Nauman examines life in all
its gory details, mapping the human
arc between life and death.
Language has always been cen-
tral to Nauman’s work, as he probed
how human beings use it to exist in
the world, to communicate or fail to
communicate. For Raw Materials,
he recycled 22 texts from previous
works and plays them on parallel
speakers in the great hall to create
an aural collage. Some are audio
components from videos or architec-
tural installations; others are written
texts from his sculptures, prints or
drawings. Nauman uses the diverse
origins of the texts to increase the
richness and density of the experi-
ence. Out of context, they become a
whole new experience, a real orches-
tral work, indeed arranged in the
space not by content but by intensity
and rhythmic connection between
them. The unique acoustics of the
Turbine Hall inspired Nauman with
this work, especially the low-level
hum or “drone” of the generators
which can still be heard, a reminder
of the building’s previous life.
The work also represents
Nauman’s fascination of space, and
the way it can alter our behaviour
and self-awareness. You do truly get
confused if you do the experience
for yourself, as the hall is empty
and yet filled with nearly palpa-
ble sound sculptures based on the
written word.
The arrangement is more intuitive
than thematic, but the last piece in
the room, entitled World Peace, pro-
vides a resting place and is also one
of the more interesting works. A man
and a woman recite a series of sim-
ple phrases around the verbs “talk”
and “listen”, such as “I’ll talk/they’ll
listen”, and “you’ll listen to us/we’ll
talk to you”. In each instance, the
statement is reversed in the follow-
ing line before moving on to the next
sequence. The title can be taken as
a wry comment on global political
misunderstanding. With an economy
of means, Nauman simultaneously
represents the simplicity and com-
plexity of communication.
The end result is not too different
to some of John Cage’s compositions,
an early inspiration of Nauman, who
held that chance occurrences and
ambient sound can hold equal status
to intentional compositions. Some of
the recordings include loops where
single words are repeated over and
over, with percussive polyrhythms
emerging. Another audio follows a
pattern in which different words or
phrases are conjugated like verbs,
repeated in different voices to extract
a variety of meanings. 100 Live and
Die is a particularly musical work
that created rhythm by attaching
a word like “scream” or “fail” to
the alternating endings “and live”
or “and die”. “Music plays a role in
my work,” Nauman has said, “even
when there is no music”.
So, it is for you to judge if one of
America’s most innovative artists,
who focuses much of his material on
things that do not provide pleasure
to others, pleases you. And it is for
you to judge whether art should be
seen and not heard... or heard and
not seen.
Heard and not seen?
We all know that children should be seen and not heard, but should the same apply to art?

“What’s all this about then?” People unsure whether they want to be in the Turbine Hall
Walking around Imperial, I see a
sort of uniform of plain-ness: plain
shoes, trousers jeans, t-shirts, jump-
ers, coats. It’s like there’s some kind
of unwritten code of what to wear.
We seem to want to blend in to the
crowd, to avoid any kind of state-
ment at all, even if that is at the
expense of looking nice. Obviously
there are many exceptions to this
trend, but it certainly seems to be
the overwhelming apparent inclina-
tion of my fellow students.
I recently trekked down to
Goldsmiths Student Union to see a
band night. Thanks to various fac-
tors, including the drunken wander-
ings of several of my housemates,
I only managed to see the Electric
Soft Parade, who were headlining,
but the evening was still worthwhile,
partly because ESP were fantas-
tic, and partly because it gave me
interesting insight into a university
which is the complete antithesis of
Imperial.
For those of you who don’t know,
just as Imperial is a science-only
university, Goldsmiths is an arts-
only university. So, without wanting
to stereotype, I was expecting a dif-
ferent type of student and a different
kind of union. I wasn’t disappointed.
If Imperial students tend not to pay
any attention at all to what they
wear, Goldsmiths students seem to
pay attention to everything about
their style.
Walking into the venue was like
walking into a sea of ra-ra skirts,
mullets, cowboy boots, charity-shop
dresses, logo t-shirts and army jack-
ets. If you’ve ever been to The End
on a Monday night you’ll know what
I’m talking about. If you don’t, think
Alison Goldfrapp, the Scissor Sisters
and Portobello Market all mixed
together.
So did they dress better than us?
As far as fashion goes, yes, and
there were certainly some people
who did look amazing. But the pre-
vailing impression was of a lot of
people who tried too hard, and all
ended up looking the same. If we
don’t try at all to stand out, they
tried so hard that they came full-
circle and all ended up looking the
same anyway.
The experience made me won-
der what is it about studying sci-
ence that makes us so complacent
about our appearance? Maybe it’s
because we like to differentiate
between ourselves and the rest of
the world. Maybe we think, because
we’re studying things that are so
much more important, that thinking
about style would be an insult to our
intellect.
But who doesn’t judge people on
how they look? Clearly, some people
judge in more detail than others,
but all clothes say something about
the person who’s wearing them.
Clothes are not just for comfort
or practicality, they tell the world
about you. So maybe it’s a good
idea to have them say something
different from the person sitting
next to you.

STYLE NOTES
Some ramblings and
the British Museum
First of all, apologies for last week.
I’m sure everyone was stupendously
disappointed due to the lack of an
Arts section and so at a complete
loss as to how to while away their
weekends and possibly the odd week-
day afternoon in a culturally enrich-
ing way. What can I say? ‘Technical
difficulties’ springs to mind, but all
that is in the past now, and we have
huge two page spread this week to
make up for it.
And now on to the ramblings. I
think I shall continue on the theme of
architecture, which brings me to the
British Museum.
Not only is the British Museum
blessed with a fabulous collection of
antiquities including the ever contro-
versial Elgin Marbles, some really
good mummies, and the Rosetta
Stone, it also has its Great Court.
The creation of what we now expe-
rience as the Great Court is quite
possibly the most significant event
in the museum’s recent history. It
has completely revitalised what was
beginning to become a tired, stuffy
old museum. Now we can loiter in
peace, in a beautiful, light space while
taking a break from the galleries.
I remember the first time I went to
the Museum once the Great Court
had been complete – I don’t think
I’ve ever spent so long just looking
up in awe. I still do, and it amazes
me every time I go (and I go quite
often!)
