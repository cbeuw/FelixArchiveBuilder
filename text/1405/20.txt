The promotional art is still being finalised by Rockstar, but they feature Len Kivingstone, the protagonist who’s pictured above, prominently. Jeremy Paxman may also feature
GTA IV expansion city revealed
Michael Cook has seen and played the first downloadable city, and he’s got all the details for you
G
TA IV has been a cash
cow waiting to burst
open with the money-
milk for some time now.
Downloadable content
featuring entire cities had been moot-
ed for ages, and I’m pleased to say that
Felix has seen and played the first city
release, and it’s just as brilliant as you
might expect.
First, let’s get the obvious stuff out of
the way – yes, it’s set in London. We
don’t have any screenshots to show
you, so the pictures that adorn this
page are only mockups, but London
was Rockstar’s choice for the first re-
lease and it’s a good one too.
We played the expansion for around
two hours, as well as being shown sneak
peeks at later content too, and we’re
ready to spill as many of the beans as
we can to you – we’ve got a good feel
for the story and the locales, as well
as the characteristic GTA charm that
you’ve come to expect from the mis-
sions and so on.
You play Len Kivingstone, a dis-
graced political candidate who’s been
voted out and left for dead by a rebel
faction led by John Borisson (voiced
by Ian McKellen). We only saw the
humble beginnings of the promised
eight-hour storyline, but Rockstar
say that it’s about “Len’s fight to
regain his power and take re-
venge on the man who murdered
his reputation.”
But it won’t be an easy fight. When
you start out, you’ve got few friends
and many enemies. People spit at you
in the street and regular newspaper
releases mock you with cutting words
that eat away at the newly-introduced
‘Feeling Of Self-worth’ meter.
Crucially, it’s still GTA IV. The taxi
service is retained and looking lovelier
than ever – although in-car radio is
now replaced with a complex conver-
sation system which takes some time
getting the hang of. At first we just
hammered the racial insult button, but
found that the drivers just talked for
even longer – watch out.
The beloved mobile phone
system is carried through
too. Now you can
choose from a
huge range of
phone mod-
els and serv-
ice providers – 3, for instance, has al-
most no service connection wherever
you are in London, or you can sign up
to O2 which allows you act like a tosser
whenever one of their adverts comes
on the TV.
Ah, TV. Rockstar went to great
lengths to license huge amounts of au-
thentic British viewing. One channel
shows reruns of the same four episodes
of Only Fools And Horses over and over
again, one just plays a loop of Ant and
Dec laughing, and the
other has Jeremy Pax-
man asking a red-
faced man to
‘answer the
question’ for four hours..
“We originally recorded a whole
host of programmes for the city, but
playtesters found this unrealistic.” my
guide explains, “We think we’ve got the
television spot on now.”
They have indeed. Right down to the
way Ant and Dec blend into each other
as they speak. Animators worked for
eight months in order to turn motion-
captured actors into the lifeless goons
that ITV viewers know and love.
Guns are a controversial
point in the new pack.
Because of their dedi-
cation to real-
ism, no-
one has a
gun
in the game. Lead Designer Tim ‘Mitch’
Mitchens explains, “We experimented
with a few different loadouts, but we
think our approach now works best –
you never see anyone with a weapon,
you just hear about it.”
It’s a step away from the violence
of GTA IV, but that’s not to say they
haven’t lived up to the mean reputation
some parts of the city have.
“Yeah, the insults had to be there.
It’s quite graphic, some of it, and we’re
expected more complaints than with
the original. We drop the f-bomb a lot.
People insult your choice of clothing.
Some of it’s pretty close to the mark,
but we really wanted to convey the
grittiness of living in the big smoke.”
To demonstrate this, he takes the
controller off me and takes a taxi up
to Hampstead. There we find an artist
sitting on the heath, sketching passers-
by. He hits a shoulder button.
“Your use of colour is
mediocre!”
There’s an awkward silence
in the room, as he knows that
I haven’t seen anything like this
before in a game.
“We’re known for push-
ing boundaries.” he explains,
“There’s more that opens up
as you go along. You can throw
bottles at people and spit in the
street. We think it’s good to have
that kind of freedom.”
The storyline is a mix of mission
styles. At first, Len’s mainly small time,
giving interviews and hosting radio
shows from time to time. The media
seems to be a big thing – the more
listeners you have, the more respect
you’ve got.
Later, though, the storyline picks up.
After our two hour play session was
over, we were shown future missions
including hanging around outside
the Newsnight studios to
face off with Jeremy
Paxman, mano a
mano.
“Jeremy was great fun to work with.
He really got into it and even agreed to
do a little motion capture.”
It shows – he sneers and cocks his
head around in the cutscenes, relent-
lessly asking the same questions with a
dead facial expression.
“We can’t do dead like Jeremy can.
Our animators have forgotten how to
do contempt.”
The final mission – an impromptu
debate during the Olympic opening
ceremony – looks positively electric.
“It’s all about how well you’ve grasped
the insult system, the anecdote-tell-
ing. There was originally an option to
headbutt Konnie Huq [during the cer-
emony] but Konnie requested not to be
a part of the game.”
Even with our extensive look, we
know we’ve seen very little. The prom-
ised story time is just the tip of the ice-
berg – you can buy shares in Transport
For London and eventually incite in-
dustrial action, you can file complaints
with the Metropolitan Police about
the noise generated by your various
neighbours, you can even take a stroll
around Imperial itself, which operates
as a hideout during the series of mis-
sions that sees Len gain an honorary
doctorate.
All in all, a solid-looking release
from a game that was already push-
ing the boundaries of taste and qual-
ity in videogames. There are plenty of
changes, but plenty to look forward to,
and there’s no doubt that residents will
thoroughly enjoy to bombing down the
London streets in a stolen taxi, on their
way to purchase the expansion pack
when it’s released next month.
Where next for Grand Theft Auto’s
winning formula?
“We’re thinking GTA V may actu-
ally be set in Slough. It’s pretty rough. I
went there once and someone actually
called me a tosser.”
“We’ve interviewed Bloods before,
gone with cops on the beat in New York
City, but that really cut. you know? In
here.”
He touches his chest and looks
mournful. This is a developer with an
understanding of the modern world,
and the emotional rollercoaster
it can be. The future’s looking
good for both Rockstar and
their runaway gaming suc-
cess story.
