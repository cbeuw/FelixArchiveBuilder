A
ll power to the imagina-
tion! 1968 and its lega-
cies: since April 10, and
until 10 June, London
has been celebrating a
‘season’ of cinema, talks, events, visual
art, literature and music which has
commemorated the cultural, politi-
cal and social protests of that signifi-
cant year. Forty years later, the season
strives to place the lessons of 1968 in
today’s context; how relevant are the
struggles and ideals of that swinging
decade in the era of iPods, iPhones and
i-don’t-give-a-shit attitudes. I am bet-
ting the majority of “young people” will
not have the faintest clue what is meant
by 1968 and they would be forgiven for
their ignorance.
The term itself is rather ambiguous
given the plethora of events of every
nature that occurred in those 366 days
(for it was a leap year). 1968 has be-
come symbolic with the plight of the
people, protests and attempts at revo-
lution which sprung up throughout
the world, sweeping the US, France,
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Mexico
and Brazil; whilst Britain remained
alarmingly quiet throughout this time:
perhaps the hangover from winning
the World Cup in 1966 had not yet
abated?!
1946 to 1964 saw the birth of the ba-
by-boom generation following the war
years and so the ‘youthful population’
changed from 11.5% in 1958 to 17.2%
Caz Knight
Revolutionaries wanted
in 1978 causing a huge rise in univer-
sity students by the late sixties. The
change to the university demographic,
notably the rise in percentage of wom-
en and black students, added fuel to
the already fiery climate in campuses
across the globe. Equal rights for all,
free love, sexual liberation (something
this campus should start campaigning
for), an end to an unpopular and
failing war, changes to the
higher education system
were things wanted
by the ‘soixante-
huitards’; many
things today’s
students take for
granted. Rudi
Dutschke at the
Frei Universitat
in Berlin wanted
war against capi-
talism via “upheaval
in centres of imperi-
alism”. Courses sprung
up in American universi-
ties with names such as ‘Radi-
cal Perspectives on Social Change’ and
groups such as the Workers-Student
Alliance emerged with a very Marxist
flavour.
Humanity’s climate was perhaps best
summed up in Germaine Greer’s book
The Female Eunuch, where she wrore:
“it may be possible to leap the steps of
revolution and arrive somehow at lib-
erty and communism without strategy
or revolutionary discipline.” This is
what the students wanted. A revolu-
tion, but the urge to party and have sex
was stronger. The human condition is
one of pleasure seeking and has been
since Caligula’s rampant hedonism in
ancient Rome to today’s unruly binge
drinkers. (But let us not for a second
put the two on equal footing!).
So why is it that today, and in-
deed in 1960s Britain, there
is a lack of revolution-
ary zeal amongst
the youth? Is it the
British condition
to be more pas-
sive than our
Yankee counter-
parts? Do previ-
ous British ‘phi-
losophies’ such as
“musn’t grumble”
and “know your
station” infer an atti-
tude of putting up with
things, or is it laziness?
One of my qualms is when
British people complain about im-
migrants stealing ‘their’ jobs: the jobs
are there, it is up to you to go and get
them!
Maybe this attitude has also hin-
dered a revolution among the people:
as a nation we (I hesitate in using the
term ‘we’) just cannot be bothered.
There certainly is a lot worth fight-
ing for and fighting against. Conserv-
ing the planet, for example. Climate
change or not, isn’t saving Earth’s
beauty just cause enough? I shudder at
the thought of a planet in a thousand
years with nothing but man-made edi-
fices. Another thing I feel very strongly
about is the sheer volume of youth vio-
lence in this city. Who brought these
children up to harbour such resent-
ment and, dare I say it, evil? Or do they
have no responsibility for their actions
and are simply a product of their envi-
ronment? The ‘Nature Vs. Nurture’ ar-
gument goes on. The main administra-
tive building at Harvard was renamed
‘Che Guevara Hall’ in April 1969. He
was a revolutionary and is still revered
today. However great he was/is, surely
it is time for our own revolutionaries
from this millennia?
Perhaps this is too much to ask with
many able-bodied people coerced into
inertia by the Internet; it seems we are
spellbound by our screens. Or maybe it
is the fact that it has all been done and
we fear the prospect of “unoriginality”.
This summer’s Secret Garden Party
has the theme “Come the Revolution”,
exploring those who have affected our
paths and inviting all attending to cre-
ate their own temporary revolution
within the Garden.
The tents in Parliament Square have
lost all their potency; it is time for a
political shake up of this stagnating
government.
Viva la Revolución!
