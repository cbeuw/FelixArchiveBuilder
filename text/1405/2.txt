Dalai Lama’s Royal Albert
Hall visit met with protests
Elections results galore
Last Wednesday, the Dalai Lama attended the Royal Albert Hall to
give a speech on ‘Universal Responsibility in the Modern World’.
Tibet’s spiritual leader, who was in London for ten days, was
greeted by two sets of protestors. The largest body (pictured
above) shouted chants of “stop lying” and “give religious freedom,”
in protest of the Dalai Lama’s denouncement of the Buddhist deity
Dorje Shugden. A smaller group of protesters also gathered, to
vocalise their support for the unification of China and Tibet
This year’s freshers get excited about student politics and begin
their quest to take over ICU, College and the entire universe
Results for the recent Faculty and Un-
ion elections have been released with
David Charles, Mark Mearing-Smith
and Mark Chamberlain elected as
Presidents of the RCSU, CGCU and
ICSMSU respectively.
Voting was strongest in the ICSMSU
Presidential election, most likely be-
cause it is a Sabbatical position. Mark
Chamberlain, the only candidate, won
with 454 votes. RCSU President David
Charles, however, won with only 207
votes, less than the number of votes
newly elected RCSU Vice-President
Andreas Esau received.
In all, turnout and participation was
high with few posts left unfilled. One
notable exception is CGCU Mechani-
cal Engineering Society; all of the posts
available were uncontested with the
exception of Departmental Represent-
ative which was won by Leo Tagg. This
leaves MechSoc in the strange position
of having a DepRep but no Treasurer
or indeed Chair.
Two elections were particularly in-
teresting in terms of the contest and
the result. The post of RCSU Treas-
urer was contested by two first year
students: Ravi Pall and Jacqueline Fok
(the eventual winner). Both candidates
played on Jacqueline Fok’s surname in
their campaign material. On her post-
ers, Jacqueline Fok promised, “I won’t
Fok with your money” while Ravi Pall
printed T-shirts featuring the slogan “I
Fok harder and better.”
The race for Council Chair saw the
current RSM President, Danny Hill,
defeated by newcomer Afonso Cam-
pos by a convincing majority of 390 to
128 votes. During the election, Afonso
Campos made use of the recently cre-
ated rules that allow candidates to cam-
paign on the record, by highlighting
that Danny Hill had walked out of a re-
cent Council meeting. Danny Hill and
current RAG Chair Karandeep Dhanoa
produced little or no campaign mate-
rial in response. Danny Hill’s campaign
may have suffered further because the
majority of RSM members were absent
during the voting period, due to vari-
ous field trips around the country.
There was a large number of fresh-
ers running for positions, with 3 out of
the 5 Central Union positions won by
freshers. Hacks were not under-rep-
resented though, with current Deputy
President Educaton & Welfare, Kirsty
Patterson, and unsuccessful Sabbati-
cal candidates John James and Mat-
thew Taylor elected to positions within
CGCU.
You can all now breathe a sigh of re-
lief that this year’s elections are all over
(hopefully), but don’t relax for too long;
the NUS referendum is just round the
corner.
