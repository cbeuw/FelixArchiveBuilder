Heartiest congratulations to Tho-
mas Dinsdale-Young, who was one
of a surprising number of people who
sent in their answers. A special men-
tion goes to Di-Emma, who, as usual,
solved it flawlessly.
Good luck this week – you may
have trouble with 1 across. Get over
yourselves.

Former women’s novice crew win WS4 4+
I
Slick at Twick; novice squads gain senior status
After weeks of glorious sunshine
across London, the rain made its re-
turn in good time for the Twickenham
Regatta last Sunday, May 25th. Follow-
ing intensive novice recruitment at the
beginning of the academic year, only
the elite few remain. Now unrecognis-
able behind layers of muscle, the crews
have refused to submit to the lure of
sleep, a good education or any form of
social life beyond rowing. Both men
and women novice squads have per-
formed well over the past year, collect-
ing medals for both regatta and head
race events in the novice categories.
The Twickenham Regatta was the first
time the novice crews were entered in
senior events.
Like all rowing-related activities, it
was an early start on Sunday morning,
made even earlier as I was convinced
by Deeps to accompany her on the
bus. Dodging rain and hopping over
puddles I waved a fond farewell to my
bike and braved the public transport
system, catching the 391 towards Rich-
mond, a stop before Deeps would join
me. But alas, there was no sign of the
Deepmeister. A phone call later I was
informed that I would be wandering
alone in Richmond in search of the
boating area since a certain alarm had
‘failed’ to initiate. Fortunately my in-
credible navigational skills (and map)
ensured I arrived before ICBC boats
and crews.
Racing was scheduled all day over a
1250 metre course along the Thames
from a stakeboat start. Races were
gladiator style; one on one; with a stag-
gered start due to the winding nature
of the river. First up was the women’s
novice four coxed by Katie Oliver
and entered in the WS3 4+ and WS4
4+ categories. The crew consisted of
Deepika Reddy at bow, Anna Jones at
two, Mackenzie Clavin at three, while
I took the stroke seat. We cruised past
HSBC in the opening heat but were
less fortunate against Twickenham
in the semi-final. A second Imperial
crew was entered in the same category
coxed by Connie Pidoux with novice
Selina Graham at stroke, Ro Smith at
three, Deborah Tamulonis at two and
Clarice Chung at bow. They received a
buy in the first heat, defeated Marlow
in the semi-final and thwarted Twick-
enham to win outright in the final. The
same crew were also racing in the WS2
4+ event and after another buy round
had to spin and race in a straight fi-
nal against Guildford, finding victory
again.
Rain continued to drizzle as after-
noon approached and little grass re-
mained in the expanding fields of mud.
Most had sensibly worn wellies, but
wanting to maximize boat speed by re-
ducing extra weight I choose flip-flops,
which apparently aren’t very compat-
ible with mud. Mammy Trapmore
took a break from washing and shin-
ing boats to pop down to the shops and
purchase a gazebo to protect her little
crews from the harsh conditions. We
thank her for the bag of goodies too.
What a trooper.
Eton Excelsior put a halt to Imperial’s
victory in the WS2 2x event defeating
seniors Claire Waterworth and Katy
Smith in the opening heat and Rach-
ael Davies and Cynthia Mynhardt in
the final. However, when the doubles
combined as a quad in the WS2 4x
they were an unstoppable force and
defeated Tideway Scullers in the semi
and Twickenham in the final.
The men’s novice crew were also in
action in the S3 4+ event. Coxed by
Helen Waller the crew were John Dick
at stroke, Michael Zammit at three,
Carlos Schuster at two and Frank Mur-
phy at bow. Despite serious Marshall
calls of ‘Is there a Dick in the boat?’,
made even more poignant due to
John’s ‘lucky’ pink hair band, the crew
remained focused and beat Staines in
the opening round, Twickenham in the
semi-final and Marlow RC in the final.
With most of the other crews done
racing for the day, only the novice
women remained to race by late after-
noon. The rain had eased but a strong
head wind had picked-up. After some
tactical pointers from Steve, we easily
defeated Thames RC in the first heat
putting the weeks of bench pressing
to good-use, overcame Guildford RC
in the semi-final and took first place
in the final by over three lengths from
Eton Excelsior. Despite our comfort-
able lead I maintained the 34 s/m rat-
ing to the finish, ensuring Deeps would
remember to set two alarms next time
we got the bus.
The novice men’s crew, high from
their earlier victory, stayed on as loyal
supporters and were a welcome sight
Christina Duffy
cheering from the regatta enclosure.
With wins across the board for all nov-
ice crews in senior events, a single ARA
point was gained by each crew mem-
ber disallowing any further participa-
tion in novice events. Understandably,
Carlos Schuster needed a moment
to compose himself during this very
emotional time which revealed Frank
as a pillar of support and comfort to all
crews. It was a huge milestone for all
involved and comes deservedly so, due
to the dedication to club training that
this year’s novices have shown, if I do
say so myself, and I do.
With de-rigging complete and oblig-
atory crew photos taken we cleared up
and loaded the trailer for Putney. Much
to the dismay of my liver, the free lift
back to Putney with Steve was sabo-
taged at the last minute by the novice
crews. With the sun finally shining and
spirits high we skipped back to Rich-
mond for a celebratory meal in Tootsies
and a few drinks along the river. The
festivities continued to Anna’s house
in Richmond where 52 cards, a terrible
ring of fire and some shirt swapping
somehow resulted in Michael Zammit
wearing a dress. And yes, there is pho-
tographic evidence of this.
Every Imperial competitor came
away with a first place victory and a
pint pewter tankard; an incredible
achievement for the club. Well done
to all winning crews and especially to
former novices! Our first race as offi-
cial seniors takes place next weekend
in the Metropolitan Regatta at Dorney
Rowing Lake in Eton. This multi-lane
regatta race is one of the main events
in the rowing calendar and has entries
from all ICBC squads. Best of luck to
everyone!
