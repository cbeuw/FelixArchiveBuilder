Scorpio
This week you give
more away about
the Felix Editor that
you fancy... ok, her
name may cause
confusion if she
introduced herself to you and put emphasis
in the wrong place. Yeh you’re confused now!
Coz you thought it was the really fit one, haha!
I’m going to make a move this week, so Felix
Editors if you find someone hiding under your
bed this week, don’t be alarmed, it’s just me.
Libra
This week the fate of
all Librans/Russians
is in your hands.

Sagittarius
This week you
decide to read
Sagittarius in the
Horoscopes section.
STOP READING.
NOW! You didn’t
listen to me did you? Well, guess what’s going
to happen now. Er... you’re going to get bored
and move onto one of the other horoscopes.
Then you’ll probably realise it’s all getting hor-
ribly self-referential and burn the copy of the
newspaper. Then you’ll die.
Capricorn
Your Libra horo-
scope was horrific.
Don’t quit your day
job, Moron. Actu-
ally, do quit your day
job. You can’t be do-
ing that very well if you can’t even fucking fill
in a stupid sodding horoscope. Leave the Felix
on the table. Get out. Go. We don’t want your
fucking kind round this neck of the woods. Die
a slow painful death involving sandpaper.
Cancer
This week the
moon’s all up in
your grill. You
and Mars go
‘round his house
and kick his teeth
out. Unfortunately he calls on Mercury and
together they do a drive-by on your mate
Pluto. The summer’s over Requiem For A
Dream-style. This horoscope ends with
homelessness, prostitution and amputation.
Gemini
This week you’re
elected Felix Editor.
You discover the
secret identity of
Angry Geek. IT’S
YOU! You write an
article exposing yourself. Put it away! We don’t
wanna see it! Although... actually, on second
thoughts... You’re overcome by the mountains
of fan-mail you receive and choke slowly
to death. How painful is a paper-cut to the
throat? Dead Geek. With huge wang.
Leo
This week you
have superpowers,
specifically
the “power of
persuasion”. You
go to the swankiest
club in London, persuade them to let you
in free, persuade them to give you and your
friends free drinks, then persuade the hottest
girl in there to dance with you and then get
beaten up by her boyfriend. Persuading your
legs to work again doesn’t work, it seems.
Taurus
This week there’s
thunder and light-
ning. You throw
open your curtains,
draw a 6-pack onto
your stomach and
stand at the window pretending you’re in Sin
City or some other over-hyped film. As morn-
ing breaks you realise that you’ve been stand-
ing, looking cool for over 6 hours and that you
are absolutely screwed in the exam you have
that day... still you looked really, really cool.
Aries
This week you try
your very hardest
to complete a
happy horoscope,
including unicorns,
pink ribbons,
fluffy bunnies and love. Unfortunately it all
goes horribly wrong when the rabbits hang
themselves with the ribbons on the unicorn’s
horn. You then marry the deceased rabbit and
have a threesome with the unicorn. Horny.
Pisces
This week’s Pisces
is brought to you
byImperialCollege
Union.
Have you heard
about the SUMMER BALL 2008! It RAWKS,
yeh bruv mashup. Put down the Felix and go
buy a ticket coz then people will think you’re
cool. If you’re mega-cool then you’ll stay up
until 4am for the survivors picture. Btw 4am is
nothing, I’m never going to sleep again...
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week you are
really depressed.
There’s so much
fun you could be
having if you weren’t
trying to educate
yourself. We all know you don’t actually need a
job, your parents could probably support you,
I mean your Dad’s minted, he does work at
Citigroup... oh right, sorry dude. It just came
out, yeah I know everything is going to be OK
and you can always stay at mine yeh?

Needy McNeedy: raped Slitherlink 1,405 in ‘88
A
ll of you look like com-
plete crap. I walk around
college spreading seeds
of joy and knowledge but
sometimes I’m just over-
whelmed by your pitiful faces staring
blankly back at me. If you emailed ag-
ony.felix@imperial.ac.uk then at least
you’d be in some kind of orderly queue.
It would make my life easier. After all,
even agony aunts have to look out for
number one.
Dear Needy McNeedy,
One night I went out and got really
wasted with some friends, and the next
day I woke up to find that I had a mas-
sive tattoo of the Nernst Equation on
my left forearm. It turns out my so-
called friends had plied me with alco-
hol and convinced me that the tattoo
would help me in the upcoming exams.
How can I get revenge on my mates?
Studentx
Dear Studentx,
You are an idiot. Tattooing formulae on
yourself is the only way to get through
this tough exam period. Why would
you want to get revenge on these peo-
ple who are just trying to help you pass
your exams? I think you owe them all a
stiff drink.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I’m doing a group project with some
mates from my course. One of them is
HIV positive. The other day he gave me
some notes for the project we’re doing.
I was looking through them and I ac-
cidently got a papercut. (Hurt a lot.) I
know it can be transmitted by bodily
fliuds. Could I now be HIV positive?
Worried, 20
Dear Worried,
Did you know Imperial is a college of
Science? You know, that thing based
on all the logic and stuff? You are an
imbecile. If I knew which department
you were in I would write to them and
get them to fail you immediately. You
won’t be HIV positive, although I would
suggest you get a medical check up be-
cause I think your brain might have
malfunctioned.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy Mc Needy,
Recently, I’ve been feeling really down
about life. I graduate this summer, and
I haven’t got a job lined up. My ex-
ams aren’t going really well, and I just
feel like everything I do is completely
pointless. Everyone is having a better
time than me. Sometimes I think it
would be really cool to commit a crime
or something and then I could go to
jail, which would probably be better
than Imperial. How can I cheer up?
X
Dear X,
Firstly, stop spending your free time
writing into agony aunt columns. You
need to remember to learn how to laugh
- watch some Peep Show. I love Peep
Show, it soothes all ailments.
Secondly, just lighten up. You actually
have your whole life ahead of you. It’s
not like you’re pushing 40 and in a dead
end job, or avoiding prison showers with
burly tattooed men, or answering a dai-
ly influx of emails from complete fools.
Your life could be so much worse. Can
you imagine how hard this is for me?
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I watched the Eurovision Song Contest
every year, and just can’t understand
why Britain bother to enter when we’ll
never beat political voting by Eastern
Europe. Although our songs are always
rubbish, I think we’re better than a
measly 14 points. Are there any other
trashy song contests I can watch that
we actually stand a chance of winning?
SecretCombination
Dear SecretCombination,
None with the legend that is Terry
Wogan. Let’s face it, nobody watches it
for the singing.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
How’s it going, dawg?
Tom Roberts, Felix Editor
Dear Mr. Roberts,
It is fine.
