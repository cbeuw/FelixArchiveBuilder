Summer Ball Dinner
Tickets Sold Out!
Dinner tickets for this year’s Summer
Ball have unfortunately sold out now
due to unprecedented demand.
Despite our Summer Ball team
working closely with College catering
to increase the number of diners by
a further 100 more than last year it
seems that there are still a number
of disappointed students out there!
However, if you are interested in
coming to the dinner then please
register your interest and we will
contact you if any tickets become
available, just email summer.ball@
imperial.ac.uk. You can still buy
entertainments tickets! These offer
all the great attractions, DJs and acts
for this un-missable evening. You can
buy online now, or from 2 June at the
Union Reception, Union Bars and the
Union Shop.
For those of you who have already
purchased their tickets I advise you
bring your confirmation emails to
the Union Reception from 2 June
to exchange them for your tickets.
Of course you can do this on the
evening, but exchanging early will
save you from queuing on the night.
This year’s ball is really shaping up
to be the best yet and I look forward
to seeing you all there! Check

for all the info.
NUS Referendum
Last week we announced that a
referendum had been called on
our continuing membership to the
National Union of Students. The
referendum will take place from
0.00am Tuesday 17 June 2008 and
end 23.59pm Monday 23 June 2008.
Our Returning Officer will be Alistair
Cott with the referendum asking
wether or not would should remain in
the NUS.
This referendum is very important
and I urge you to read next week’s
Felix and Live! where both sides of
the argument will be put forward.
If you do feel strongly either way
about this issue then please do vote.
Any questions should be directed to
Alistair Cott dpcs@imperial.ac.uk.
Club & Society Update
Hopefully by now all clubs should
have held an election for next years
committee members. It is vitally
important that you let us know who
these new officers are so we can
inform them of training opportunities
and ensure the correct contacts are
published in the 2008-09 Clubs &
Societies handbook, which will be
sent to all new students. The form
for letting us know who your new
committee members are is available
online at imperialcollegeunion.org/
forms
Don’t forget that this weekend is
the deadline for sending in your
updated contributions for the
handbook.
Training for new Club and Society
officers will begin next week, all
the information is available online at
imperialcollegeunion.org/clubtraining.
If you are going to be a club officer
next year please ensure you sign up
for the relevant sessions.
Election Results
Over the last few weeks many
elections have been taking place
with votes in all Faculty Unions and
central Union elections also. All had
a great turnout and produced some
hard fought wins for the successful
candidates involved.
