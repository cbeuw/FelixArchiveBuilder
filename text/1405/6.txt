umanity has some curi-
ous constants about it.
Even after thousands of
years we still enjoy uri-
nating on the little guy
when we can, and most of us are follow-
ing our ancestors in front of crucifixes
and prayer mats each week and day. It
also seems that the thirst for two-way
backscratching hasn’t lessened since
the times of empire-building loons ei-
ther, if the latest hijinks in Burma are
anything to go by.
Reports from news services and the
conference in Rangoon suggest that
human compassion in the modern day
could come with a pricetag – help to
the cyclone-devastated population of
Burma could be restricted based upon
the government’s motions towards
open and free democracy.
No-one could claim that Burma’s
military junta are anywhere near the
top of the global sanity rankings, and
their response to protests last year are
still fresh in many people’s minds. Nev-
ertheless, the idea of holding a nation
to ransom for the glory of democracy
seems slightly bitter tasting, given the
initial rush to help the population who
seem to be suffering terribly.
For me, it strangely brings back
memories of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Over time, everyone accepted that
there simply were no weapons of mass
destruction within the borders. But
those who still wanted to support the
war quickly found new justification.
Most often, this proved to be some-
thing along the lines of “Iraq is better
off without a dictatorial ruler.” And
while twenty-four hour news chan-
nels were happy to prove this at first, it
quickly became evident that this wasn’t
the case. Look at Iraq now, and even
through the media’s eyes it’s a sad sto-
ry. What little stability is present there
is not enough to rebuild a nation, and
elsewhere there is chaos.
The West always presumes to know
better, and that’s understandable. We
invented the Computer, the Ameri-
can Dream and the Teabag. Naturally,
we feel that we know where the world
should be heading. Many postgrads at
Imperial are working on this very prin-
ciple – that faraway countries are do-
ing it wrong, and we can do it better,
and here’s how.
It’s a policy that overstretches in-
frastructures at home, fuels suspicion
of Western culture, and damages the
countries in question by stop-starting
their way of life. That’s not to say Im-
perial’s work is second-rate or damag-
ing, but there are questions to be asked
when considering intervention at this
high political level.
If we make these bold demands of
Burma, they will almost certainly be
rejected. And then what? Either we
lose face on the international scene by
giving in to a police state, or millions
die. Alternatively, we suck it up, do the
humanitarian thing, and give aid to
people in need.
I’m not a particularly compassion-
ate person when it comes to interna-
tional politics, but I do think that if any
of the world’s major problems are to
be solved, then countries need to co-
operate without an agenda. Britain’s
response has shown that we’re still as
petty as the states we oppose – and the
time for pride swallowing is running
out.
I guess there’s a lesson here for us all

A repetitive truth
I
don’t know how many of you
grabbed the celebrity whine-fest
that was Channel 4’s 11th Hour
last week, but if you did you
might be interested to know that
I’m hosting a group counselling session
in the JCR this coming Tuesday to try
and recover from it.
Although I’ve envisaged television
shows combining the concepts of
Leonardo DiCaprio and loss of hu-
man life before, the producers of this
show didn’t combine the two ideas as
I might have, presumably for legal rea-
sons. What results is a kind of whiny,
watery program that’s a bit like An In-
convenient Truth, but with a friendlier
look on its face. Like being told you’ve
got an incurable disease, but by Emma
Thompson.
The programme probably could’ve
been made by anyone who’s picked up
a copy of The Independent recently, but
that’s not the point – I associate MS
Powerpoint with global warming so
strongly now, that whenever someone
shows me a pie chart I immediately
strip down to my hemp underpants.
The point is that I can’t think of a sin-
gle reason to broadcast a show like
11th Hour anymore, because the mes-
sage it had for us boiled down to this –
the world is in trouble, but there’s still
time.
Well, that’s all very well, but the world
and its solar panel knows about global
warming these days. Sure, there are
some who refuse to accept it in public,
or downplay its significance, but there
isn’t a single person who doesn’t see
the processes in effect. The naysayers
are just outward deniers – as with me,
I know that Boris is mayor, I just feel
better if I whisper to myself that it’s not
true.
What I suspect was the real reason
behind it was to keep pressure on the
people mentally. There’s a widespread
belief that if you stop bellowing a warn-
ing at people they will forget it, which
is why we still have “Kill Your Speed”,
“Don’t Drink And Drive” and “Half-
Price Sale Now On At DFS” despite
the fact that we know it all by heart
already.
However, I’m of the opinion that this
has the opposite effect. Global Warm-
ing is something of a unique problem
– similar in structure to voter apathy,
it requires individual involvement on
a large scale. Whisper the message in
people’s ears too often, and they switch
off the recording equipment. The
treadmill is still running, but the sev-
enty year-old with a weekend gym pass
is now firmly embedded into the wall.
It’s made even worse by the “we can
still save the day, if we act now” subtext,
because act now has been the mantra
for two decades, and the fact that the
situation is still being marketed as re-
versible is causing a lot of people to
switch off.
People and business are changing.
They may be changing too slowly ac-
cording to most studies, but the fact
that they’re acting at all suggests that
now is the time to stop lecturing and
start the practical work.
Programmes about real-life conser-
vation, green practices and how-to’s
would do a lot better than trawling out
the same carbon dioxide cycle diagram
all over again. We get it now – less
trees, more pollution. We all watched
Captain Planet, we don’t need to see it
animated.
I have no doubt that we’ll see more
of these shows this year and further
on. The combination of celebrity with
a Panorama-like taste for hysteria is a
good mix for the media outlets, and for
all I know it may be the only way to get
the topic shown on American TV at
all. But I’m left with a nagging feeling
that we’ll look back in ten years’ time
and decide that the real reason things
progressed so slowly is because we
spent too much time debating, and not
enough time acting.
