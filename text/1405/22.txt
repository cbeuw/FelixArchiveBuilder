67% of Imperial students would
masturbate over this picture
I
n a recent survey carried out by
the Hangman team; I say team,
really it’s just the two of us and
we are about as far removed
from the word ‘team’ as human-
ly possible... Anyway in a recent survey
of Imperial students, the Hangman
team discovered that 67% of Imperial
students would masturbate to this pic-
ture, if only they had a copy; I told you
I’d come through guys.
The survey was carried out late at
night in the library last week. If a stu-
dent replied “Get that picture out of
my face”, we added them to the ‘No’
column. If the student replied “Can I
have it, I really need a break from all
this revision and I think the toilet’s
free”, we put them in the ‘Yes’ column.
Disturbingly, it soon became clear that
we needed a ‘Been there, did that’ col-
umn after a whopping 48% of respond-
ents told us that they had already mas-
turbated over the picture and that we
might want to wash our hands after
handling it.
More male Imperial students re-
sponded ‘yes’ than female students.
The breakdown of male students is as
follows, of those who voted ‘yes’, 39%
were frustrated Physics post-grads
who haven’t had sex since they joined
Imperial, 51% sabbatical officers who
have lost touch with real, enjoyable stu-
dent life and 4% computing nerds who
were too busy watching ‘Two guys, one
horse’ to notice what we showed them.
A
fter a year running ICU
RAG and dressing up
as a zombie on a regu-
lar basis (the picture
on the right is the day
of his first exam), you’d think that
Luke Dhanoa/Karandeep/ choose
a name and stick to it you bastard,
would be in a prime position to be-
come Council Chair. Unfortunately
Much more interesting results were
thrown up by the female respondents.
12% tore up the picture, grabbed me by
the shirt collar and made violent love
to me in front of the water fountain
(is it obvious that I’m really frustrated,
The kind of girls Ross Goldberg used to get before he got stabbed. Now that he’s out of the way, its my turn
good thing I’ve got this picture). An-
other 34% turned out to be friends of
these Page 3 beauties and set upon me
screaming a combination of “Pervert!
Rapist! Deviant! Lecher!”, to which I re-
plied “Ladies, ladies, hey... please... stop
that... it kinda of hurts”. Needless to say
I spent that night in hospital suffering
from stiletto stab wounds... sigh.

Scientists discover negative
mass... really far away
A
new study conducted by
Imperial College’s Ein-
stein Institute has made
a ground-breaking dis-
covery: negative mass.
For years it has been believed that
negative mass did not or could not ex-
ist but according to Professor Twiddle-
dee Twiddle-do this was a result of in-
sufficiently powerful technology “The
negative mass is just really far away, it
is only now that we have the equip-
ment to contact it.”
The technology that allowed this
discovery is BT’s new ultra-fast broad-
band service. With new high capacity
integrated servers you can now keep
in touch with your friends no matter
where they are, even at the other end
of the galaxy.
We are unlikely to see negative mass
on Earth any time soon, apparently it is
wary of strangers and repelled by ‘posi-
tive devils’ as it describes us. All this
reporter has to say is “Don’t be scared,
let’s hang out, let’s be pals.”
The truth is out there... sigh, I am such a douche
RAG to... umm ZOMG
IC student buys election
D
id you vote in the the
elections just gone? No?
Neither did the rest of
College. How then did
Afonso Manuel anão
Costa Campos win?! I’ll tell you how;
with money. This guy is so rich he rents
the penthouse suite in Beit, you didn’t
know there was one? Well that’s be-
cause you’re not rich enough. There’s
a joke in here somewhere (email us if
you find it. We sure as hell can’t).
After many minutes of investiga-
tion we uncovered the truth. Afonso
“Fonzie” Campos hired a 4th year
computer science student to hack the
union voting system, swaying the elec-
tions in his favour. 390 votes Campos?
I bet my left testicle (Bob) 390 votes
weren’t cast for the entire election.
Tracing the e-paper trail back to the
source, Hangman confronted the mer-
cenary student named Hacker McRan-
dy (a really l33t hack0r in the online
comunity know as McRandy_1). When
questioned McRandy broke into tears,
saying Afonso paid him £3.7 million.
The sexy truth is exposed!
Unfortunately Bob couldn’t be re-
attached and passed away last night.
Dhanoa eats babies, FACT
of all people running for the positions
in the previous elections he’s the only
one who deserves the crown of loser.
Only 55 votes, sigh... less than RON.
Who knows why nobody liked him
enough to vote for him? All I know is
that I can’t wait to have dinner with the
girlfriend I would have if I didn’t spend
all my time making fun of other people
on this page... Wanna go out? Please?
“I’m naked from the waist down”
