COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE TO THE TENTH WORLD FESTIVAL OF DEMOCRATIC
YOUTH REPORTS BACK
As a representative of ICU
(elected by council) I took part
in The 10th World Festival of
Youth and Students which was
held in East Berlin, the Capital
of the German Democratic Re-
public. The festival did not
receive much coverage from
the press so I will start my re-
port by explaining briefly the
historical background of the
Festival.
In 1 9 4 5 after the war, 4 3 7 repre-
sentatives of 3 0 million y o u n g people
from 6 3 countries m e t in London at
the inaugural congress of a n inter-
national youth organisation, w h i c h
was to be called W o r l d Federation
of Democratic Youth ( W F D Y ) .
Friendship
The a i m of this Organisation w a s
to unite a l l democratic a n d progres-
sive youth in the w o r l d in a c o m m o n
fight against war, f a s c i s m , imperial-
ism and oppression. A t the conference
the delegates p l e d g e d to " e r a d i c a t e
all traces of fascism a n d create a
deep a n d lasting friendship between
all peoples on e a r t h " a n d to " K e e p
a just a n d lasting peace a n d fight
against poverty, exploitation a n d u n -
e m p l o y m e n t " . T h e delegates further
agreed o n a programme of action for
the W F D Y a n d i t started its work i m -
mediately afterwards. F r o m the start
the W F D Y took several initiatives,
but the most important w a s the organ-
isation at the first festival in Prague
in 1 9 4 7 . S i n c e then the world festi-
vals have been a recurring feature.
Unity
The first festival, in w h i c h 1 7 , 0 0 0
people from 7 2 countries took part,
showed the determination a n d unity
of w i d e layers of young people to
fight against a l l forms of f a s c i s m
and to rebuild a peaceful w o r l d after
the destruction of the w a r . In spite of
different political convictions, reli-
gious beliefs a n d different systems of
society several fruitful d i s c u s s i o n s
and solidarity meetings w e r e h e l d .
From these emerged the feeling of
unity w h i c h w a s to characterise a l l
successive festivals.
Solidarity
The participants at the first festi-
val also c o n d e m n e d the " T r u m a n
D o c t r i n e " of the President of t h e
U S A w h o w a s responsible for drop-
p i n g atomic bombs on Hiroshima a n d
Nagasaki. S i n c e then ten W o r l d Fes-
tivals have been held a n d the main
slogans of these have changed in
accordance with the international
situation. Although the latter has
changed since that first festival, the
need to hold them is as great as ever.
The U S imperialist aggression in
Vietnam has been defeated, b u t the
victory is not yet total, it Is still neces-
sary to organise international soli-
darity for the right of the Vietnamese
people to self-determination, for the
implementation of the Paris Agree-
ment and for the liberation of 2 0 0 , 0 0 0
political prisoners held in Thieu's
jails. In A f r i c a , Portugal is massacring
the Africans w i t h weapons supplied
b y N A T O , liberation movements such
as the P A I G C a n d F R E L I M O are
actively involved in warfare against
Portugal. In South A f r i c a a n d Rho-
desia the apartheid regimes are sup-
pressing the majority of the popula-
tion w i t h the b a c k i n g of b i g British
and A m e r i c a n companies.
Peace
A l l this shows that the forces of
imperialism a r e still very strong a n d
it is therefore vital that a l l anti-
imperialist forces should b e united in
a wide offensive against these re-
actionary forces. It is in t h e creation
of this unity that t h e festivals n o w
can play an important role. T h e main
slogan of the Tenth Festival w a s thus
" F o r anti-Imperialist solidarity, peace
and f r i e n d s h i p " .
Christian
The British delegation for the Fes-
tival w a s organised by a committee
drawn from w i d e sections of the
Youth a n d Student movements, rang-
ing from the Y o u n g Liberals to the
Y o u n g C o m m u n i s t League, from the
N U S to the Student Christian M o v e -
ment. T h e only conditions for partici-
pating w a s agreement on the main
slogan of the festival.

Diplomatic
On the 27th August the delegation
departed for B e r l i n . T h e trip w a s not
uneventful. West German border
Police forced, with no apparent rea-
son, some Iraqi students on the dele-
gation to leave the train with their
luggage. T h i s w a s quickly stopped by
the ploy of making half the delega-
tion leave the train a n d leaving the
other half inside, meaning that the
West Germans c o u l d not move the
train without splitting up the delega-
tion a n d making themselves some
diplomatic trouble w i t h the G D R . T h e
action proved t o b e effective, a n d
ten minutes later the Iraqis w e r e
released.
Co-operation
W e received a tremendous w e l -
c o m e in Berlin. T h e festival, w i t h
3 0 , 0 0 0 participants from 1 0 4 coun-
tries participating, w a s amazingly
well-organised. There w a s a special
topic for each day, such a s " S o l i d a r -
ity with the peoples of I n d o - C h i n a "
or " T h e Struggle for peace, inter-
national security a n d co-operation",
around w h i c h the day's programme
centred. Solidarity Meetings a n d C u l -
tural programmes were organised on
open air stages in several parts o f
the town, and lectures, seminars, c o l -
loquia a n d other meetings, where par-
ticipants c o u l d freely exchange views,
were held at the university, Apart
from that there were separate pro-
g r a m m e s for students, young w o r k -
ers, cultural workers a n d sportsmen
and w o m e n . T o give a n example,
over 6 0 different events w e r e organ-
ised for one d a y , not including the
d i s c o s , p o p festivals a n d other forms
of free entertainment w h i c h went o n ,
d a y a n d night. Delegations spent c o n -
siderable time in d i s c u s s i o n s w i t h
other delegations, a n d these formed
some of the most relevant parts of the
festival.
Low Taxes
The delegates alas h a d a m p l e o p -
portunity to see for themselves 'how
a socialist system works. T h e British
Press (with a f e w exceptions) h a d
brought out reports about the disas-
trous situation of the economy of the
G D R , h o w the State h a d brainwashed
its young people in special c a m p s
before the festival s o that they w o u l d
be able to mix w i t h representatives of
the so-called free w o r l d . However,
w e s a w nothing of that. W h a t w e s a w
was a rich country w i t h a n active,
open-minded population, w h o seemed
to take great interest in what w a s
happening in.the w o r l d a n d w h o d i d
not seem to suffer from a n y hardship
or lack of freedom a s the British
establishment defines it. U s u a l l y
when people from the w e s t go t o
socialist countries they report o n h o w
they could exchange money o n t h e
black market, a n d h o w people c a m e
up t o them a n d asked if they c o u l d
buy clothes, etc. B u t the shops w e r e
full, a n d no people seeme'd to be lack-
ing. T h e average wage in the G D R is
only slightly higher than here, b u t
this does not take account of the g o o d
social services, very l o w taxes a n d
lower prices than here.
Violent
There were no attempts b y the
G D R to prevent contact between
young Germans a n d the foreign parti-

cipants; in fact, quite the contrary.
A group of Christian Democrat stu-
dents from West 'Berlin had come to
the festival with the a i m of distribut-
i n g anti-socialist leaflets a n d d i s c u s s -
ing such matters w i t h people in the
street. This gave rise to some violent
discussions, but there were no moves
to stop them. Unfortunately the Bri-
tish delegation were handicapped
since the arguments went o n in Ger-
m a n , and only very few spoke that
'language. But many of us made con-
tact with English-speaking Germans,
many of w h o m invited us to their
homes.
Freedom
The purpose of the Festival w a s
s u m m e d up in 'the main slogan. It
must have been a n enormous encour-
agement for the representatives of the
liberation movements in A f r i c a a n d
Indo-China w h o are involved in a w a r
to gain their freedom to see young
people from a l l over the w o r l d a c -
tively expressing their solidarity with
them and show that they w e r e not
alone. It w a s certainly a great encour-
agement to us more fortunate people
to see a n d meet people involved in
greater yet similar struggles to our
own. It is n o w the duty of a l l the
organisations w h o supported the fes-
tival to use the experiences gained
f r o m there to strengthen the anti-
imperialist solidarity movement in
their countries. T h e fact that many
different organisations participated
make it possible to broaden the
basis of that struggle a n d involve yet
more people. T h e work of the Tenth
Festival is not over, for the 'discussion
a n d c o o p e r a t i o n must go o n a n d
ways of carrying out the main slogan
must be found.
Stalinist
Last week an article under the
heading " S t a l i n i s t meaning of free
d i s c u s s i o n " appeared in Felix, the
article dealt with what happened to
P. Tatdhell, a G I F representative o n
the British delegation during the fes-
tival. It turned out to b e an a l l out
attack on the tenth festival. A s a par-
ticipant at t h e festival w h o actually
thinks that there w a s freedom of
speech in Berlin a n d hence a " S t a l i n -
i s t " , there a r e a f e w points that I
w o u l d like to raise.
Harassment
The editor of iFelix Who I believe
wrote the article forgot to mention
that the F D R is o n e of the countries
With the most progressive legis-
lation on homosexuals as P. Tatchell
in his report recognises. H o m o -
sexuals have full civil rights. A l l
kinds of discrimination against homo-
sexuals is forbidden according to the
law a n d this is vigorously enforced.
It is true that equality before the l a w
does not automatically m e a n that a l l
deeply rooted prejudices against
homosexuals have disappeared. This
might explain the harassment that
Tatchell w a s subject to o n t w o or
three occasions. But one cannot deny
that homosexuals in the G D R have a
m u c h better position than here. P.
Tatchell also recognises this in h i s
report w h e n he says that on many
occasions h i s leaflets were very well
received a n d openly d i s c u s s e d b y
young Germans.
Civil Rights
The article goes o n to s a y what
happened to P. Tatchell a n d his pla-
card w h i c h read " H o m o s e x u a l Libera-
tion — Revolutionary H o m o s e x u a l s
Support S o c i a l i s m " a n d o n the other
side " G a y Liberation Front, London.
Civil Rights F o r H o m o s e x u a l s " in
German. What happened w a s that a
majority of the delegation d i d not
want this placard to be seen w i t h the
British contingent.
Diversion
This does not mean that the major-
ity were against G a y Rights, b u t
rather that the majority thought that
the whole issue of homosexuals at an
anti-imperialist festival w a s a diver-
sion from the essential question. Per-
haps this majority thought that homo-
sexuals d o not form a special group
in society suppressed by imperialism,
so that neither do gays automatically
form a group w h i c h supports social-
i s m nor does the fight for Gay Rights
become an anti-imperialist fight a n y
more than the fight for a more open
and free relationship between hetero-
sexuals is. T h e text of the placard
also seems to recognise this. It reads
"Revolutionary Homosexuals Support
S o c i a l i s m " a n d not only " H o m o s e x -
uals Support, e t c . " S o if this is the
case w h y bring in the issue of homo-
sexuals, as it c a n only act as a diver-
sion.
Punched
A leaflet w h i c h P. Tatchell distri-
buted read, " R a d i c a l homosexuals
are committed to a socialist revolu-
tion because it alone gives the poten-
tial to revolutionise interpersonal re-
lationships; to liberate them from eco-
nomic restraint, a n d exploitation b y
c a p i t a l i s m " . Here again w e see the
w o r d radical in front of homosexuals.
I a m also sure that any rnarxist w o u l d
agree that this w o u l d apply to the
•relationship between heterosexuals,
in fact I think it w o u l d apply to any
kind of interpersonal relationship.
The article further quotes P. Tat-
chell. " P e o p l e w e r e punched, k i c k e d ,
clothes were ripped etc. a n d threats
m a d e upon m y l i f e . " What actually
happened w a s that P. Tatchell refus-
ed to abide by the decision of the
delegation a n d that a group of people
therefore went into action a n d rip-
ped the placard to pieces. T h e vio-
lence he speaks about lasted about
30 sees, a n d from where I stood
(about 15 yards from P . Tatchell) it
didn't look as if anybody's safety, or
for that matter, life, w a s threatened.
The article also speaks about a
rumour w h i c h went round before the
vote took place. It is supposed to
have said that the placard read " G D R
persecutes h o m o s e x u a l s " . However,
I d i d not hear that rumour.
I cannot c o m m e n t about what hap-
pened after this point as I h a d to take
a n earlier train to go to Switzerland..
Opportunist
I have spent s o m u c h space c o m -
• menting on what m a y seem a rela-
tively minor incident in the context
of the festival for t w o reasons.
One is that some groups within the
N U S are using these incidents to
wage struggle against some members
of the N U S executive w h o were pre-
sent at the festival. These groups are
•not so m u c h concerned about gay
rights to w h i c h the executive is a l -
ready firmly committed as about
kicking some individuals out of the
executive. These kinds o f opportun-
istic tactics must be firmly resisted
because they could d o harm to the
N U S as a whole, specially n o w when
the N U S is involved in the grants
campaign a n d the m a x i m u m degree of
unity a n d involvement is essential.
The other reason i s that the inci-
dent is also used b y other groups to
attack the festival as a whole, a n d
thereby divert the attention away
from the anti-imperialist aspect of the
festival. T h e article w h i c h appeared
in Felix last week w a s such an exam-
pie of that tactic. Articles attacking
the festival have, not surprisingiy,
c o m e from the Express, the Daily
Telegraph a n d other Fleet Street
papers whose relations to B i g Busi-
ness are too well known. But I must
admit that I hadn't expected Felix to
join ranks w i t h these papers. I know
that the editor likes to call himself a
young socialist, but his consistent
attack o n the anti-imperialist move-
ment makes m e doubt what his true
colours are. R E N A T O E Z B A N
