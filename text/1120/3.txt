In brief...
Britons Abroad
What do a marijuana leaf, chilli-fried
worms, petrified moose droppings and
a blade of grass from Ramsey Street all
have in common? According to a
recent survey these are some of the
more unusual souvenirs that globe-
trotting students will be bringing home
as a reminder of their summer abroad.
Some of the more bizarre sou-
venirs included a dried llama foetus
from Peru, bullet casings and grenade
outers from a volcano in Rwanda and
a camel dung ashtray.
The survey, conducted by Visa
International and STA Travel, revealed
some remarkable facts about how
British backpackers spend their money:
Backpackers biggest worries were los-
ing money, luggage or their passport,
with very few being concerned with
local customs, etiquette or language
barriers.
Holsten Bier Fest
It has been confirmed that the annual
Holsten Bier Fest will again take place
in Battersea Park later this month. The
Bier Fest aims to recreate the atmos-
phere of an authentic German Okto-
berfest, with two pint steins, German
food and tribute bands.
Music at the Bier Fest will include
'The Real Abba Gold', 'The Cheeky
Monkees' and The Sound of the Bee
Gees'. Forty thousand people are
expected to attend this year's event,
consuming more than a quarter of a
million pints of Holsten Export.
The Bier Fest runs from 12 October
to 1 November. Tickets cost from £3
to £7 and can be booked by phoning
0171 344 0044.
MCC Admits Women
Marylebone Cricket Club, one of the
most influential forces in world cricket,
has finally voted to accept female
members, after a 211-year binge of
male exclusivity.
The announcement was made this
week, following a 69 percent majority
'yes' vote amongst the MCC's mem-
bers. As well as providing sexual equal-
ity, this move also allows MCC access
to much-needed National Lottery
grants, which were previously unavail-
able.
£4.5 million will be made available
to the club, a sum which was withheld
by the Sports Council on the grounds
that MCC did not accept men and
women on the same terms.
Despite an eighteen-year waiting
list, the MCC are confident that there
will be female members by the turn of
the millennium.
Medics Have a Ball
Charing Cross and Westminster Med-
ical School Students' Union (CXWMSU)
appear to have been somewhat care-
less in the organisation of their sum-
mer ball at the end of last term.
According to one source the event
made a loss of more than £40,000,
although the exact figure could not be
confirmed as Felix went to print. Dave
Hellard, ICU President, explained that
the matter was under investigation but
could not comment further. A more
detailed report will appear in Felix in
the next few weeks.
Russel Group Again
The Russel group, an association of
leading research-led universities of
which Imperial is a member, has
unveiled plans for a scheme by which
postgraduate students on Masters
courses would be able IO transfer their
studies without hindrance between
establishments adjudged to be of a
comparable standard. The system
might lead to a 'gold standard' post-
graduate qualification. The move has
been attacked as elitist snobbish by
universities excluded from the plans. A
vice-chancellor of a university in the
Russel group said 'What the group is
seeking to move towards is a general
acceptance that a credit achieved at
one university automatically entitles a
student to move to another univer-
sity'. Sceptics fear it will be a step in the
wrong direction, re-establishing a
divide between established universities
and former polytechnics at a time
when integration and common
ground is being sought.
Oxford Union
President Expelled
All Campbell
The president of Oxford University's stu-
dents union has been expelled from
her studies, following allegations that
she cheated In an examination, accord-
ing to an article In the Times newspaper.
The piece, which appeared in the
9th September edition of the publication,
details an investigation into the conduct
of Katherine Rainwood, 22, who is said
to have used "unfair means" in her final
year examinations.
Rainwood was reading politics, phi-
losophy and economics at St. Hilda's
College, and was allowed to sit the
examination in a separate room from
other finalists, due to her claim that she
was suffering from a wrist injury.
The protagonist was provided with
supervision for the exam, and allowed to
type answers into her own personal
computer. The suspicion of the author-
ities was aroused when the president
allegedly downloaded and submitted
an essay she had composed previously.
The ex-president began her studies
at St. Hilda's reading chemistry, but sub-
sequently changed her course at the
end of the first year. She was involved ini-
tially with the Oxford Union debating
society, but quickly became interested in
the Union proper, and rose to be elected
as its president in June. She resigned two
days later, telling friends that her deci-
sion to quit was based on "personal rea-
sons".
Miss Rainwood is said to be appealing
against the decision.
