Investment banking is in rapid change. Success in this
climate can be achieved only by focusing on clients'
business needs and supplying innovative, competitive
solutions. To achieve success demands the resources
to sustain new initiatives plus the right people to create
and drive them.
As the Investment Banking division of the Barclays
Group, Barclays Capital has access to a $350 bifiion
balance sheet and enjoys an AA rating. This solid
foundation gives us the necessary credibility and
resources.
The people we are hiring to manage these resources
are as ambitious for themselves as we are for our
business. They are people who are seeking a challenge
- a challenge that starts immediately, and places them in
a uniquely entrepreneurial and meritocratic environment.
We are recruiting BAs, Masters and PHD's for
permanent and summer positions at Barclays Capital.
Opportunities exist at our five principal centres of global
business - New York, London, Hong Kong, Singapore
and Tokyo.
