14 Column 2 October 1998
Thought for the Day
Opportunity Knocks
I
spent a good fifteen hours this sum-
mer doing something at which, I have
to admit, I am quite good. This activ-
ity, for those of you who are interested,
did not include vomiting up my own
bedroom wall; nor did it involve the
repeated consumption of pints of
opaque ale (I have given up this partic-
ular vice, as the aforementioned act of
decoration was murder to clean off).
Sadly, as those of you who read my gub-
bins last year will accurately have pre-
dicted, it was not an activity of a sexual
nature either. You could not really
describe it as leisure, but the fact that I
was doing it at all is, I suppose, indicative
of one of the best aspects of Imperial Col-
lege.
The pastime in question was the
proof-reading of a section of the shiny,
new (and thankfully very far from being
a black, depressing, ring-bound Gotham
City hulk) ICU Student Handbook. With
no promise of personal gain, I was the
one superhero w h o could save an
embarrassing violation of the print dead-
line, armed only with a packet of chew-
ing gum, a new haircut, and a thoroughly
anal desire to see the laws of modern
English upheld. A friend in need is a
sucker indeed, though, as I discovered
after staring at computer screens for so
long that my contact lenses stuck to my
eyes like clingfilm, or a month-old boiled
sweet in the pocket of an old man's rain-
coat.
While I could sit here for hours and
ruminate on the turns of fate which left
me clutching a pen and a section of
computer printout at two in the morning,
I feel that this would alienate busy fresh-
ers, who in turn feel that they should be
in the bar. It was upon reading this sem-
inal version of the Handbook, though.
that I realised something;
an aspect of life at Imperial
College which is vital to so
many students, and yet
completely neglected by so
many others - Clubs and
Societies.
The fact of the matter
is that clubs offer not only
an opportunity for enthusi-
asts and hobbyists of all
walks of life to satisfy their
passions, but also provide
an extremely open and
useful social structure. All

years of study avoidance,
I am more pleased with
what I write than ever
before (despite utter apa-
thy from you lot, and
worse still from certain
Felix staff), have social
confidence that I only
dreamed of when I was at
school, and can even do a
fairly competent spin-
back. I've also gained
desktop publishing skills,
which, let's face it, will be
useful on my CV. (As you

My personal experi-
ence of these shady cults
stretches no further than Publications
Board-run Imperial College Radio and
the Union rag that you are reading right
now. (I did once have a look at STOIC.
Student Television of Imperial College,
but Robin Riley scared me away). This
does not change the fact that I have
made a lot of fine friends, enjoyed writ-
ing and making a fool of myself on the
radio on Thursday nights, and not least,
learned new skills. Before I came to IC I
had completely neglected literary com-
position, heartlessly sacrificing it for the
joys of maths and physics, and leaving it
behind as just one part of the heady
memories of GCSE. Worse still, I had
hacks alike; when the
drinking becomes boring,
the drugs don't work or
the cold showers are no longer having
the desired effect, you can't really lose by
giving it a try. Freshers' Fair will be com-
ing up soon; shake off the hangover, get
out the sunglasses, fill your pockets with
corporate freebies, and get involved.

finally, and I've saved this point until
last, because it is pretty irrelevant.

Jammy sod. Anyway, if I do have to write
for the whole year, you lot might as well
give me some feedback. To date, I have
received one letter, and that wasn't a ter-
ribly interesting one. Surely some of you
must find me extremely annoying. Ah,
come on. You're not even trying.
