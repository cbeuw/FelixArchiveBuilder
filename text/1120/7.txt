Farewell Print Unit
The first major announcement is that
Felix will be published on Mondays from
now on. This is because we must now
use external printers, since the Union
Print Unit has been closed down, and
unfortunately they are not as quick (and
probably not as good) as dear Andy
Thompson. I would like to take this
opportunity to wish Andy all the best in
his future music career - anyone not
going to the Freshers' Carnival could do
worse than the Water Rats, Gray's Inn
Road, Kings Cross that Friday night.
OI, you! Yes, you! Read this!
It has been a summer of mixed blessings
for Imperial students. The announce-
ment of a new education and welfare
sabbatical, along with London Transport's
decision to provide discounts on travel-
cards, are both important developments,
if long overdue. The freshers among
you, however, are probably more con-
cerned with tuition fees and how you are
going to afford three or more years in
London. Meanwhile old hacks will be
wondering if we will ever get a full com-
plement of sabbaticals and Union officers
first time round.
Which brings me on to the age-old
problem of student apathy. There is
going to be an election in a few weeks
time in which YOU, the students, are
the electorate. We wouldn't have a fifth
sabbatical or cheaper travelcards if it was-
n't for Union officers, at ICU and else-
where, fighting for students. YOU
choose these sabbaticals, YOU vote for
them: Their job is to represent YOU.
Remember that when Monday 9 Novem-
ber arrives.
Let's get stuck in...
The BMS has been a nightmare from
start to not-quite-finished. It was never
going to be ready on time; we all knew
this, some of us even dared say it, but
now the proof is before our eyes. Sure,
it Is a very nice building (especially the
glass lifts) and, yes, teaching will start in
it on time. Talk to the people who have
to work there, however, and you'll get a
different picture. 'The great move' will
certainly be remembered, if only for its
appaling organisation. I should know -1
was waiting half the summer for the
Biology Common Room to be vacant so
I could set up the new Felix office. Biol-
ogy are still moving.

Thank you for your generosity
My old department and I Ihus share
one thing in common - we've both been
treated with utter contempt by the
Lstates Division. I dare say that statement
will prompt replies from the higher ranks
of Biology, but we know what the peo-
ple on the ground arc saying. I am also
aware that many of the problems can be
blamed on the contractors. I have other
reasons for my opinions, however.
My story is as follows: It is now 8.30am
on a cold and damp Wednesday morn-
ing, I have two hours to finish this first
issue, and I haven't slept for a good day
or two. A week ago I was not in the
slightest bit confident, which I took as a
good sign. I had barely started the lay-
out and staff were failing their exams like,
well. Union officers. Advertising was
coming in as if Geri Spice was my busi-
ness manager, yet actual articles were
sparser than firsts in Aero Lng. Then, one
particularly stressful evening, I was
informed that the new office was only
'temporary accommodation'. I knew that
- Felix is only here for a year or two. 'No
no no - very temporary.' How temporary,
exactly? 'As in November temporary. As
in Estates want the room back.' Fortu-
nately they changed their minds, but I'm
still tempted to charge them for two
dented filing cabinets.
Not to be outdone, the next day
they tried to stop the Union using the
Great Hall for badminton, fortunately
they couldn't ignore a prior minuted
agreement guaranteeing the. Union's
use of the Hall (although they obviously
did at first). I've been hearing (presum-
ably unfounded) rumours about
flowerbeds, car parking spaces and daf-
fodils worth their weight in gold. It's
going to be one of those years. Still, I'm
an open minded man, and the letters
page is always there for your comments...
What else?
Nothing really. Believe It or not, there
was a lot of news. News writers, how-
ever, are somewhat harder to come by.
The final emergency-ad-to-fill-space for
the news pages came courtesy of Lon-
don Electricity Board, who decided to
cut all power to Beit from midnight Tues-
day until 4am Wednesday. The first I
knew of it was when security came round
at 11.55pm. Hence I had to come back
at 4.30am this morning to finish this oh-
so-memorable first issue. So forgive me
if it's not up to expectations. If you've got
ideas, you know where to come. I'm out
of them and off to bed. And whoever is
responsible for choosing last night to
make emergency repairs, stay out of my
way... td
