Ali Campbell explains the perils facing freshers in their first few days...
Fresher. You're a very busy person, right? I imagine you've located the bar, found a cash machine and are n o w well posi-
tioned to get absolutely plastered. I know you've also spotted s o m e o n e living on your landing, three doors down, of
w h o m you'd quite like carnal knowledge. Well, the grim reality is that in four weeks' time you'll be in lectures, and the
object of your affection will be in bed with someone else. Your best bet is to read the following carefully, ignore any
cynicism which might have escaped the editor's eagle eye, and enjoy Freshers' Week while you are still footloose, fancy
free, and most importantly, in credit.
Saturday 3rd October
Warp Six
Sunday 4th October
Tears before bedtime
With a bit of luck, it is now Saturday and
you're reading this while sitting on your
bed, watching your parents
pack your stuff away neatly in the
wardrobe and considering
approaching the Hall warden
to get a transfer to a single /
room, following the discovery
of some half-digested food in
your room-mate's bed. Many
of you will be feeling a bit
anxious right now; this is
extremely common. The solution
is simple. Get out of your room as
quickly as possible, find some people
who don't look too weird, and with your
head and your wallet held high, plot a
course for the bar. Warp six. Make an
effort to get to know the re-apps; they
have a duty to make you feel wel-
come and, between pints, will
tell you everything you might
want to know (albeit in a
decreasingly sober fashion,
I'm afraid). In two hours'
time you will be wondering
what you were worried
about. One piece of advice
that might be worth remem-
bering when you are staggering
back upstairs is the following: the
landings will all look the same. Think
hard before getting your keys out, or you
might make your first enemy.
Sunday can be a bad day. The experi
ence of waking up in a . strange
environment coupled / x with a
colossal hangover can
make even the most beau
tiful morning seem like the first
few hours of a life prison sentence
If a tearful telephone call back home
doesn't help (and it didn't in my case),
then the solution is once more to get
out. There should be a few people
around who are blissfully unaware that
it was you who copiously barfed into the
sink on your landing, so round up a
posse and have a wander around the
local area. (If spending your parents'
hard-earned cash doesn't cheer you up,
then you are beyond help, if you'll for-
give my bluntness.) There will most likely
be a social event in Hall today, which you
should not miss, even if you are feeling
pretty grotty from the night before. You
might also want to check out the Stu-
dent Union; you will be spending
many nights and quite a few
shekels there, and there's
â€¢ f e . time like the present.
Oh, and let nei-
ther of us " ^ ^ ^ pretend you aren't
going to get drunk again tonight. Try
to keep your clothes on this time.
Monday 5th October
Complaining mass
Tuesday 6th October
Photographer
You say you already know what a queue
is? What was that? You're accusing me of
being condescending? Sorry, my friend,
but I have been here two years already.
I know what queues really are.
The first endless line to join is the
registration queue:
this complaining mass
of students will mate-
rialise from 9:30
onwards. The latest
opinion from our
esteemed editor is
that the JCR (Junior
Common Room) will
be finished on time,
and this is where reg-
istration usually takes place. It is situ-
ated off the Sherfield Walkway (follow
map or signs or use your finely-honed
homing instinct). Alternatively, registra-
tion is also possible from 28th Septem-
ber onwards in the Sherfield building.
queue (kju:) (n.)l.a
line of people, vehi-
cles etc., waiting for
something...
level 3 (the Registry). You will be given
a worthless-looking piece of paper, but
do not be deceived: if nothing else, you
need it to get at the cheap Union beer.
Take this document to the Union with
some passport photographs and
demand an ICU card.
You can also get a
ULU (University of
London Union) card
at this opportunity,
although you will
need another photo.
Also happening on
Monday are the CCU
(Constituent College
Union) welcomes;
times and locations are in your trusty
Union handbook.
Monday night is freshers' Ball night;
get yer tickets early.
It's possible, and does not require a ter-
rific stretch of the imagination, to think
of Freshers' Week as one long party,
fledgling student, meet your depart-
ment. After this initial introduction, these
two are seen to be snogging outside the
toilets, will embark on a
love-hate rela-
tionship, get
married and will
be together long
after the party has
finished, before
arguing on a ther-
monuclear scale and
divorcing each other
three or four years
later.
Welcome to your department. Today
you will be unable to resist the deadly
charms of your departmental building,
be it Huxley, Elec. Eng. or the so-brand-
spanking-new-it's-not-finished-yet BMS
building. Your hungover visage will be
preserved by a sadistic photographer
and branded onto a swipecard. If all this
humility proves insufficient, you will also
be subjected to a
plethora of depart-
mental meetings.
Still, never mind.
Tuesday afternoon
Is Freshers' Fair
time: let's hope for
a nice sunny day.
Old hands and
new alike will
wander around
the campus, visit-
ing stalls set up by many of the
clubs and societies at Imperial College.
Take your time and sign up for a few
worthwhile activities. Oh, did I mention
that Felix will be making their presence
felt? Please help us; everybody's failed.
