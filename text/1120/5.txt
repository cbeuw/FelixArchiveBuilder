Unilever is one of the most successful consumer goods businesses in the world.
To maintain this success we need to recruit individuals of the highest calibre to become the
managers of tomorrow. We invest heavily in training, developing what is considered the
world's finest management training scheme - UCMDS.
So why don't you check us out? If you are a penultimate, final year or post-grad student,
