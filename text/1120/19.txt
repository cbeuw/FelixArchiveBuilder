2 October 1998 Freshers' Guide 19
Give us a job, Guv'nor!
Welcome to Imperial College. The next
three or four years should be among the
most interesting and enjoyable in your
life, provided you make the most of the
opportunities available at the College.
This letter aims to give you some ideas
for your own self-development.
Coming to university is a significant
step. You have more freedom, more
independence and more opportunities
to do your own thing, to succeed or fail,
than you will have had at school. If you
do not make some mistakes you will
not have learnt anything; learning from
one's mistakes is an important part of
experience. Build on the experience of
others - take advice (it's usually free) -
ignore some of it, test it out, accept or
reject it.
You have already
demonstrated some
planning ability by pass-
ing 'A' levels, or their
equivalent. How are you
going to plan the next
three, four or more
years? And I'm not talk-
ing just about your acad-
emic studies: I'm talking
about the start of the rest
of your life.
What do you want to achieve this
term? Making friends is usually high on
most people's list. How? Join clubs and
societies, attend meetings, take up a
new sport, develop a new interest - any
of these are likely to bring you into con-
tact with like minded students. And
there's always the bar to prop up while
seeking inspiration.
By the end of the summer term in
your first year
you are going
to be feeling
financial pres-
sure - in other
words you'll
be broke! So
how about
earning some good money in the long
vacation. If you leave job hunting until
the holiday starts you may be too late. All
the interesting and lucrative jobs will
have been filled already and you will be
lucky if the local council wants some
grass cutting or the garden centre needs
a spare pair of hands. It's well worth-
while doing some preliminary job hunt-
ing between Christmas and Easter. Call
in at the IC Careers Ser-
vice (Room 310, Sherfield
Building) where you will
find information about
Vacation Training, write
to employers with your
CV, call in to some local
shops and hotels and
see who's advertising in
the local press.
Holiday jobs can be
most informative. Ide-
ally they give you the
chance to try out work or a future
employer in which you are interested.
They give you experience in job hunting,
letter writing and interviews, as well as
a real insight into what it's like to work
for an employer. Some even pay quite
well. Jobs abroad are popular and early
applications are essential. Start by visit-
ing the IC Careers Service which has a
good range of reference books and
addresses.
At the
start of the
second year
you will raise
your sights
higher. Now
is the time to
test your skills in organising something
- a social evening for your department,
looking after the finances of a society or
being fixtures secretary of your team.
"That sounds too much like hard work!"
I hear you say. Yes, it does take some
effort on your part but generally speak-
ing the more effort you put into some-
thing the more enjoyment you will get
out of it.
Committee work is
excellent preparation for
life after College. You
learn to set agendas, run
meetings, agree actions,
persuade other students
to do things, work within
budgets and end up with
a successful event - a
party, a visit, a play or a
newspaper; think how
much effort went into producing this
edition of Felix. [You can stop that right
there - Ed]
You should start thinking seriously
about your future career before the end
of the second year. Even if you haven't
a clue what you want to do, that's no
excuse for delaying finding out about the
possibilities. You are surrounded with
sources of information - friends, family,
tutors, careers advisers, libraries, the
internet. Start looking. It may be a long
process but it really is worth spending
time thinking about your career, then
planning your next weekend or holiday.
The IC Careers Service is a good
starting place. Pop in and speak to the
information staff. Find out about
'Prospect (HE)' - our computer careers
guidance system - and all the information
booklets and reference files. Have a
look at some of the videos, attend some
seminars or careers, get yourself sorted
out.
The Milkround is in the spring term
of your final year. This is when employ-
ers visit campuses to interview appli-
cants or invite you to their London
Offices.
Christmas vacation courses are a
popular way of finding
out about careers such
as marketing but only a
few major recruiters run
them and they are nor-
mally over-subscribed
many times.
"Stop! I'm only a
fresher - why are you
telling me all this?"
I'm telling you
because you need to start planning your
life now; don't just drift through College
and emerge with a degree and nothing
else. Of course a degree is important
and must be your first priority, but not
your only priority.
In the meantime, enjoy yourself.

societies, attend
meetings, take up

interest...'
John Simpson, Director of Imperial
College's Careers Service, welcomes
you to Imperial and reminds us why
we are really here...
'...don't just drift
through College
and emerge with
a degree and
nothing else...'
Gradunet give their opinion on how to run your student days and, surprise surprise, they can help
As a certain cockney charmer might have
said "not a lot of people know this", but
the first and second year are as important
to your job prospects as the third year.
When writing your CVyou will soon
realise that a vivid imagination is the
most important weapon in your job hunt-
ing armoury. "Fixing the lock on the
bike shed" becomes "I was secretary of
the Mountain Bike Club" whilst "going to
the cinema" makes you "vice-president
of the student film society".
The average student recruiter goes
through thousands of CVs and applica-
tion forms and soon learns to decipher
these coded messages. You need to
learn how to pierce even the most expe-
rienced recruiter's cynicism, and land
the job of a lifetime.
First Term
Join the societies that are really of
interest to you. Join a scoiety that you will
still want to a member of in three years'
time, because by then you will have
achieved responsibility and your CV will
show determination and staying power.
Second Term
It's time to turn your attention to the
summer. It makes sense to take advan-
tage of those long summer holidays and
travel the world. It's time to show your
planning and execution skills. Save up,
get a part time job to earn enough money
to go somewhere. As a student there are
loads of great flight deals, and there are
plenty of places where a small income
goes a long way. Work overseas can give
you a small income and plenty of new
friends. Even if it goes horribly wrong you
can show your future employer what bril-
liant Improvisation skills you have.
Third Term
Now that you have the summer all
planned you can relax and concentrate
on your academic work. After all, no
amount of extra curricular activity is going
to make a poor degree look better.
Second Year and Onwards
You return from the summer with
your horizons broadened, ready for the
challenges of the second year. You
should be helping at the Freshers' Fair
and learning about presentation skills.
Start thinking about work experience.
To make your OV glow red hot apply for
work experience with a blue-chip com-
pany (e.g. Mars, Ford and Unilever).
In your third year you will start apply-
ing for jobs in earnest. Gradunet can
help, with details of the brochure and
application form of 100 companies avail-
able online. Send off CVs. fill in applica-
tion forms, attend recruitment fairs and
get yourself to some interviews. If finals
are approaching and you still haven't
got a job lined up, concentrate on your
academic work - a 2:1 will improve your
chances of getting a job enormously.
If none of this advice works, try using
the words in bold on your CV.
