London Transport Announces
Student Discount
Ali Campbell
A major breakthrough has been made
which will benefit many London-based
students, as London Transport
announces substantial student discounts
on tube and bus services.
The new Student Photocard, which
was officially launched on 21 September,
allows full-time students between the
ages of 18 and 24 attending any London
school or college a 30 percent discount
on period Bus Passes and LT Travelcards
valid for one month or more.
This announcement comes after
years of lobbying by the NUS (National
Union of Students), ULU (University of
London Union) and other College unions
across the capital, and follows a trial of
the 'card at Queen Mary and Westficld
College in 1996. Matt Hyde, President of
ULU, commented: "We're pretty
pleased... it's obviously a major break-

before

to have a stu-

Accord-

proved reluc-

ceed with the new discount after the
pilot scheme, and there followed con-

The new card, and ULU President Matt Hyde, who
helped negotiate the deal with London Transport
organisations, including candidates for
the post of Mayor of London. He
explained that attempts had been made
as far back as
the early 1980s
to negotiate a
deal of this
nature, describ-
ing the bureau-
cratic process
as "... like
changing the
direction of a
big ship." He
also voiced his
disappoint-
ment that the
deal has not
been made available to mature students:
"I am vociferously opposed to the 18 - 24
age limit... there is still work to do on the
mature students' side."
The provision of this card is also wel-
come news for ULU itself, as some have
felt that the services provided to its mem-
bers do not justify the £91 000 per year
membership fee. The ULU President,
when presented with this question, sug-
gested that ULU's success in this matter
should be interpreted as an indication of
good things to come. David Hellard, Pres-
ident of ICU, confessed that "...it shows
what can be achieved if ULU is fully
exploited." He also outlined his concern
about the age restrictions imposed by
London Transport, drawing attention to
a "potential massive loss", but hopes that
the agreement might be rc-cvaluated in
the future.
In the meantime, application forms
are available for the new card in the
Imperial College Union Office.
The Summer of Discontent?
Resignations over the summer holidays
have caused difficulties for student
organisations throughout Imperial, leav-
ing ICU, two Constituent College Unions
(CCUs) and RAG without vital committee
members.
Adam Cherrington, who was elected
as Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
last Spring, has been forced to resign
after failing his Biology second year
exams. The news was announced early
in the summer, leaving ICU without a key
sabbatical officer during freshers' week
for the second year running.
Meanwhile both Katy Nolan (RCSU
President) and Hamish Common (C&GU
President) have also stepped down for
academic reasons. Miss Nolan made the
decision after changing from a four year
to a three year course, while Mr Com-
mon failed his second year earlier this
month. In a worrying development for
RAG. which organises several events dur-
ing the Autumn term, Rob Park (RAG
Chair) has left Imperial, and is believed
to have started a new course at QMW.
Dave Wharton, who stepped down as
Deputy President (Finance & Services)
Elect last term, has also been forced to
leave the college, and is now studying
at University College.
Thus once again the first term will be
taken up with a round of elections. Stu-
dents interested in standing for either
CCU Presidency should contact the CCU
office concerned. Dave Hellard, ICU
President, has set the timetable for elect-
ing a new DP(C&S): Nomination papers
will go up on Monday 12 October, hus-
tings will take place between Monday 2
and Wednesday 4 November, with vot-
ing in all departments on Monday 9 and

Fifth Sabbatical
for ICU
ICU Is to have a fifth sabbatical officer,
starting In the academic year 1999 -
2000. I he new officer's self-explanatory
title will be Deputy President (Education
& Welfare). The decision brings ICU in
line with other London colleges, many of
whom already have sabbatical officers
concerned with welfare.
The decision was announced by Imper-
ial's Governing Body after a meeting in
July. ICU has been trying for some time
to get approval for the fifth sabbatical:
Dave Hellard, ICU President, explained
that it "took a lot of justification... but was
vital". He was quick to praise his prede-
cessor, Andy Heeps, who was responsi-
ble for much of the negotiation on
college committees,- "we take our hats
off to Andy". Elections for the post will
be held along with the other sabbatical
elections in the Spring term.
