20 Column 2 October 1998
Business as usual on site
Reports of my death are greatly exag-
gerated. You (the denizens of Sherfield)
thought I'd gone. Fat chance. They still
haven't found a decent columnist, which
means you're stuck with me, though this
year will be my last. I say this now,
because I feel I owe it to my dear friend
Lynda Davies, the redoubtable Head of
PR. She was filled
with emotion, I am
told, when she
found out that I
was staying here to
do a PhD, so it only
seems fair to break
the news early. So,
in the words of a
famous philoso-
pher, nice to see
you, to see you nice. Welcome back, or
welcome for the first time. Though peo-
ple come and go, this year is different,
since we now have the new School of
Medicine. Given the warmth of feeling
that exists between St Mary's and the
South Ken campus, we can be assured
of interesting times, particularly on Friday
nights in the Union, though I suspect that
some of our medical friends will visit
said establishment as often as Mary
Whitehouse frequents the Raymond
Revue Bar.
Since my middle name is Peter and
not Originality, I shall start by offering the
traditional advice and wisdom to you, the
freshers. First and foremost, those funny
red police cars. If you are new to London,
you may well be confused. No need. All
the policeman in such vehicles helpfully
have the same name, which is Sir. Lovely
blokes, but not the best audience for stu-
dent humour. Secondly, you may have
heard - and your parents feared - that uni-
versities are a hotbed of sexual activity,
where a bit of slap and tickle is even
more assured than in the Oval Office.
Imperial, on the other hand, adopts the
moral high ground, believing that sex
before graduation is a sin. In the excep-
tionally unlikely event that you should
need the requisite protection, bear in
mind that the machines on campus have
not yet been converted to decimal
coinage. Finally, we come to alcohol.
Ignoring for the moment the inevitable
rubbish someone will spout this week on
the subject of 'institutionalised' drinking,
it is better to consider quality, not quan-
tity. Imperial offers two drinking venues,
the Union and Southside. The former is
a great place to spend a drunken
evening, especially in Freshers' Week,
sipping vodka or Jack Daniels. If you're
dying for a good pint however, avoid it
like the plague and head to Southside
Bar in Princes Gardens. It gives me no
pleasure to bemoan the state of the
Union's beer for the umpteenth time, but
while it stays like it is, I shall not sleep
from mental fight etc. All in all, you have
chosen well. Impe-
rial is a fantastic
place to be a stu-
dent, if a little on
the pricey side. Tha
statement, as you wi

ing work near the library. All the lovely
block paving and car park spaces have
been removed, a
path has been laid
and what, to the
untrained eye, looks
like a flower bed is
under construction. Of
course, it couldn't pos-
'...not even Imperial
would sacrifice a row
of parking for a few
daffodils...'
Voice of Reason
soon learn, is on a par
with 'Imelda Marcos
had quite a few
shoes.'
This year is also
notable because
it marks the
introduction of
tuition fees.
Lambasted by the NUS, who said that it
would lead to a massive drop in univer-
sity applications (it didn't), it will be inter-
esting to see if students' minds are more
focussed on the end result of their three
years here. Without wishing to sound
like an old git, this is no bad thing, since
the job market is no bowl of cherries.
That said, there are two ways to get a
good degree from Imperial. The first is to
spend all your time locked in your room
reading every book ever published on or
around your course. By this method, of
course, any fool could get a First in any-
thing, but be rendered totally unem-
ployable. The challenge is to come out
with the right result, but have a bloody
good look at this thing called life. Having
been there and done that, I would rec-
ommend the latter strategy. As for the
whole debt thing, keep it in perspec-
tive. A regular table at the Savoy Grill is
probably off the cards, but remember
that the banks will believe the most ludi-
crous old guff given in support of an
overdraft application. Christ, they even
gave me one.
Last year, at the behest of the then
editor, I gave a beginner's guide to the
institutions of Imperial, explaining places
such as the Sherfield Building, the admin-
istrative centre. You may be thinking that
is not the correct way to spell Sheffield,
or possibly 'why the Hell is he talking
about a building full of paper pushers?'
Ah, the naivete of youth. For this build-
ing possesses dark forces from which
you will not escape, as any old lag will tell
you. The latest edict from on high in the
Estates Division concerns a bit of build-
sibly be a flower bed,
because not even
Imperial would sacri-
fice a row of parking
for a few daffodils,
when the money
could have
been better
spent on re-
re-re-refur-
bishing 170 Queens Gate. Whatever the
final outcome, this is a monstrous waste
of money, when one considers the state
of some of the Halls, for example Fisher
Hall. I had the pleasure of residing there
over the summer because the Dorch-
ester was full. The state of repair is poor
to say the least, but before the Suite
Five dwellers write in, let me explain. I
acknowledge that everything cannot be
done immediately, and where the
builders have been sent in, the results are
impressive. However, it is both annoying
and depressing
when one sees
the manner in
which mainte-
nance has been
carried out in
Fisher and, I pre-
sume, elsewhere.
Walls touched up
with paint that even Stevie Wonder
would consider a poor match, polyfilla
slapped in the general direction of cracks
and a disgraceful mess left wherever the
'tradesmen' have been. When money is
spent, it Is given to contractors who are
woefully incompetent by a department
that clearly couldn't care less about build-
ings which, if they play their cards right,
they will never have the misfortune to
visit. Looks like this year will be business
as usual.
