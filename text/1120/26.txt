Canoe Club
make a big
splash
Phil Manfleld
While most members of the canoe club
are off travelling the world or paying off
their overdrafts during the summer,
those of us still here at College try to get
out on the water from time to time. The
heavy rain last weekend meant that the
Thames was still high on Monday after-
noon; an afternoon's white water is far
more fun than one in the lab.
Our usual playspot is Hurley weir on
the Thames. Some great white water
blasts through the sluice gates and forms
some big surf waves, so that talented
boaters can pull the full range of spins,
cartwheels, retendoes, bandits and other
cunning stunts, and the not-so-talented
can get their earwax hydraulically
removed.
"Useless" Rob made a typical start by
leaving most of his kit behind at College
but. showing an admirable determined-
ness to get cold, he elected to go canoe-
ing anyway, without the comforts of a
wetsuit or dry-top. He was soon show-
ing his true colours (hypothermic blue)
as he repeatedly fell out of his boat and
swam around the weir pool, with Instruc-
tor Garth on rescue duty. Those of us
who had remembered that rivers are
cold, and brought plenty of warm gear,
had a great afternoon playing on the
waves.
The canoe club is one of the most
active outdoor clubs in College.Every-
one is welcome, from the complete
beginner to the hardened white-water
addict. We own a full range of boats
and kit for members to use. and have
several qualified instructors in the club.
Throughout the year, we run trips to
rivers around the country. We also have
weekly pool sessions, where we can
teach beginners in the warm tor more
information, come to any pool session
(Tuesday evenings, meet 7pm in Beit
Quad or 7.30pm at the sports centre) or
email slappers@ic.ac.uk.
Seems the foot-
ball club had a
good holiday
Stuart Cook & Andy Swift
Dear helix,
I am writing on behalf of the ICU
Association lootball Club to thank
everyone who helped with the suc-
cessful summer football tour to the Al
Garve, Portugal this summer. In partic-
ular we greatly appreciated the
generous financial help given by the
Harlington Trust and Imperial College
Union as well as the support given by
frank Murray, Neil O'Shaughnessy at
the Union and, of course, the tireless
effort given by the former Union
President Andy Heeps.
On the pitch we won 2 of our 4
games, losing the other two games
narrowly 1-0 and 2-1. Credit must be
given to Dan Perreria who managed to
score an own-goal in each of those two
games! Thanks also to tour captain
Darren Boland who did a sterling job. Off
the pitch everyone had a great
time especially that, perhaps against the
odds, nobody was deported!
On a separate note if you wish to
join the AFC please come along to
our stall at the Fresher's lair, sign up
then come along to the trials on
the first Wednesday and Saturday of
term.

Another great
summer for ICU
Gliding Club
Andy Holmes
The gliding club continued flying all
through the summer break again this
year and, despite poor weather, we had
loads of fun and some great flying.
The summer started with a week-
long course at Lasham airfield in July, dur-
ing which two of our pilots flew solo for
the first time. Only the thought of how
expensive the round would be with ten
people on the course, and two instruc-
tors, reduced the size of their grins!
Although there were reasonable
thermals in July, the weather improved
greatly in August and, on Saturday 15th,
club captain Andy Holmes flew a 350
kilometre cross-country with an instructor
in 496 - the club's training glider. This is
the longest distance flown by this glider
in 1998, and the flight took them from
Lasham airfield (near Basingstoke) to
Shobdon airfield (near Hereford) and
back to Lasham in 4 hours 30 minutes.
The flight started with a tow to 2000 feet
behind a powerful Piper Pawnee tow-
plane,
release
over
Lasham,
and cir-
cling in
thermal lift
to climb
high (up to
over 4000
feet at some points). They then flew in
a straight line towards the intended goal,
gradually losing height until they had to
climb in a thermal once more.
Later in August, Andy attended a
cross-country course at Lasham airfield,
in order to be cleared to fly away from
the airfield by himself. During the
course, Andy completed his Silver badge
with a first solo cross-country flight from
Lasham to Old Sarum airfield, near Sal-
isbury (54 km).
Completing the Silver badge allowed
Andy to enter the British Junior Gliding
Championships in one of the gliding
club's single seat gliders, 296. Although
one solo cross-country was hardly
enough to prepare him for this compe-
tition, Andy enjoyed himself and learned
quickly,
and by
the end of
the week
he had
covered
260km on
a day
when a
300km
task was set, and completed the 240km
task on the last day of the competition.
For both of these flights, Andy was air-
borne for over six hours!
Andy isn't the only keen pilot in the
club however. An cx-IC student directed
the competition. Another ex-student
came second, after having won the com-
petition last year. IC students have also
been members of the British team for
The competition grid on the main runway at Lasham airfield
turopean and International events. ICU
Gliding Club has a long history of train-
ing people from their first flight to inter-
national level, and it seems that this
trend will continue. Do you want to be
part of this success story?
The gliding club flies all year round,
and offers trial flights for those who want
to try it before they join the club. Courses
and tours to other gliding clubs (and
sometimes other countries!) are often
arranged. If you want to find out more
about a sport which allows you to travel
long distances, using only your new-
found understanding of nature's energy,
then contact us. If you want to learn to
fly at less than a tenth of the price of
power flying, contact us. Even if you just
want to fly some aerobatics, please con-
tact us. We're here to provide a cheap
introduction to gliding for anyone who
wants to try it. See us at the Freshers' Fair
or contact me on
andrew.holmes@ic.ac.uk.
