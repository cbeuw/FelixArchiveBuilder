Imperial College London has signed a
memorandum of understanding with
Zhejiang University (ZJU) that could
see the creation of a UK campus for
the Chinese university at White City,
where Imperial’s new Imperial West
campus is to be built.
The memorandum was signed on
the morning of 15 May 2013 dur-
ing a ceremony in the Great Hall of
the People in Zhejiang Province. Sir
Keith O’Nions, President & Rector of
Imperial College London, Hao Ping,
Chinese Vice Minister of Education
Jin Deshui, Council Chairman of ZJU,
and the Governor and Vice Governor
of the Zhejiang Province signed the
memorandum. The seniority of the
Chinese delegation is a sign that this
proposal is being taken seriously by
the Chinese Government. Xinhau, the
national news agency in China, pub-
lished the news and Chinese television
news bulletins have run stories on it.
Zhang Xiuqin, Director of the De-
partment of International Coop-
eration and Exchanges at China’s
Education ministry, said: “China will
support and help its universities to go
out and internationalise”. She said that
the ZJU’s London campus would be a
“valuable step” towards this goal. If the
