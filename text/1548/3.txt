Full List of Winners
The winners of Imperial College Un-
ion’s ﬁrst Student Academic Choice
Awards have been announced at a cer-
emony on Tuesday 21 May. Over 150
people attended the event.
The eight winners (see box at the
end of the article) were picked from
over 400 entries that the Union re-
ceived. Best Teaching for Under-
graduates received 244 submissions
from students. The winner, Dr Alistair
Donaldson from the Department of
Computing, said “I’ve been constantly
impressed by how bright, enthusiastic,
questioning and hard working the un-
dergraduate students are”. He said that
the award “really means a lot” because
it is coming from students and that he
is “hugely honoured” to be praised for
his lecturing ability.
Anna Hikel from the Department
of Civil and Environmental Engineer-
ing echoed the sentiments from Dr
Donaldson, saying, “I am pleased that
the students recognise my dedication
to them”. She went on to say that she
“was thrilled to receive the news that I
had won the award”.
At the event, Paul Beaumont, Union
President, said: “The SACAs is our
way of thanking all of the nominees
and winners for their hard work and
recognising the positive impact that
they have on the student experience.”
Each of the winners received a tro-
phy, and all ﬁnalists were presented
with a certiﬁcate.
