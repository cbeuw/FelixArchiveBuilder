ou probably think hu-
mans invented com-
munication networks.
However according to
recent research, plants
might have got there ﬁrst, communi-
cating with each other through exten-
sive underground fungal networks.
Most soil-based fungi grow as hy-
phae: long, branching ﬁbres that
form spreading network-like struc-
tures known as mycelium. In some
cases the fungus goes a step further,
interacting with the roots of a plant
beneath the ground, in a symbiotic
or mutualistic relationship. The my-
celium is highly eﬃcient at absorbing
water and minerals from the soil, and
the colonised plant gets the beneﬁt of
this, allowing plants to thrive even in
drought conditions or mineral-poor
soils. In return, the fungus feeds oﬀ
the energy-rich sugars made and
stored by the plant. The mutualistic
relationship may also increase the
plant’s resistance to disease and toxic
metals.
It has been suspected in recent
years that fungal connections be-
tween plants might play some role
in communicating. The recent study,
however, provides the ﬁrst experi-
mental evidence of this mechanism
in action.
The bean plants used in the study
can develop resistance to infestation
by aphids when exposed to a sample
of the insects. However when two
plants were connected by the fungal
Compared to uninfected mosquitoes
malaria parasite-containing mosqui-
toes are approximately three times
more attracted to the smell of hu-
mans, a study shows.
The researchers from the London
School of Hygiene & Tropical Medi-
cine infected malaria mosquitoes with
the deadly parasite that causes malar-
ia, Plasmodium falciparum.
They put the mosquitoes in a con-
tainer with socks that had been worn
for 20 hours before the experiment.
The scientists recorded the number
of times the mosquitoes attacked the
socks.
They repeated the experiment with
uninfected mosquitoes.
The infected mosquitoes attacked
the socks more often and fed for long-
er than uninfected mosquitoes.
The ﬁndings, published in PLOS
ONE, suggest that the malaria parasite
manipulates the behaviour of mos-
quitoes and makes them more blood
thirsty.
It cannot resist the smell of human
blood and bites more often and for
longer. This gives the parasite a higher
chance of getting passed on to hu-
mans, so its lifecycle and the deadly
disease can continue.
Nick Kennedy
Dr Logan from the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
said, “We have shown for the ﬁrst time
that the sense of smell could hold the
key to understanding how the parasite
successfully manipulates the mosqui-
to to ensure its spread. Exploring this
further opens up the possibility that
we could use this knowledge against
the parasite by developing tools with
crucial chemicals found in human
odour.”
These ﬁndings will enable research-
ers to develop better mosquito traps
that speciﬁcally lure malaria-infected
mosquitoes by human scent. This
should help eradicate the parasite,
which infects more than 200 million
people every year, over three times the
population of the UK.

If you’re still in the midst of revision,
holed up in the library, cramming
equations and formulae into your
swollen brain, scientists might have a
solution. A team of researchers have
studied harmless brain stimulation
and found it can be used to improve
cognitive ability for up to six months.
The team trained a group of 25 test
subjects in mental arithmetic whilst
stimulating their brains using a tech-
nique called transcranial random
noise stimulation (TRNS). In typical
sci-ﬁ style, TRNS involves applying
DC current to the scalp with elec-
trodes in saline-soaked sponges. The
researchers trained the volunteers in
arithmetic drills and calculation, in-
volving shallow and deep level brain-
work respectively. By stimulating the
area of the brain used for tricky arith-
metic functions, the researchers found
the subjects processed unlearned ma-
terial better and that 6 months after
the TRNS brain-training they retained
improvement in the deeper brain cog-
nition.
The scientists hope the research
could be used to help people who suf-
fer with neurodegenerative illness,
strokes or learning diﬃculties not
only in maths but also in other brain
functions. Lead researcher Roi Cohen
Kadosh said, “Maths is a highly com-
plex cognitive faculty that is based on
a myriad of diﬀerent abilities. If we
can enhance mathematics, therefore,
there is a good chance that we will
be able to enhance simpler cognitive
functions.”

network, the aphid-exposed ‘donor’
plant was able to transfer signal-
ling molecules through the myce-
lial network to a ‘receiver’. This gave
the receiver plant the information it
needed to develop aphid resistance,
despite never having encountered the
aphids itself. A ﬁne mesh barrier was
used to prevent actual root-to-root
interactions, and controls using non-
connected plants demonstrated that
the communication was not simply
diﬀusion through the soil, providing
strong evidence that the plants really
are chatting to one another over the
network.
The researchers suggest that we
may be able to manipulate mycelial
networks to develop new ways to pro-
tect agricultural crops against pests
and disease. Either way it is clear that
these generally overlooked networks
are a huge part of plant ecosystems,
maybe as much so as the internet and
social networks are a part of our so-
ciety.
