can drink tea until the cows

“Tea is instant wisdom –
just add water” – A. Alauda
My most recent experiment in-
volved a very ancient tradition. One
that is the same in Chinese as in Per-
sian, Urdu or Dari. The word is ‘chai’
Now, such research is not because
puny eﬀorts at lifting ﬂoating weights
in aqua aerobics has not done much
for the strength of the mind, and nei-
ther have countless tests. This investi-
gation is because of a solid attempt to
actually investigate the link between
tea, meditation and life.
Tea is a way of life. No joke. In some
cultures, drinking tea is the most won-
derful way to relax. You have your pot
of hot water, tea leaves, honey and
cup, and for a few moments drinking
ﬂavoured hot water and ‘being’ is a
special moment.
So how does this link to meditation?
The way of the tea is the link. The art
of making it and mastering the minti-
ness, honey and tea (for example not
ever adding cold water). When you
focus on the cup and tea, emptying
your mind. Feeling numb. You’ll pretty
much be reaching Nirvana. Soon.
To say it was a bit of a surprise to
discover that there was Echinacea
tea, lemongrass to even lavender tea,
would be an understatement. My nar-
row world had been shown some light.
After mixing many teas, and actually
feeling unwell prior to this, I stumbled
upon the right mix of mint leaves, car-
damoms, lemongrass and ginger tea.

Surprisingly, it was curing. Nowadays
I have an obsession with teas, I think,
which would totally contradict that
with trees. This is because of incor-
rect meditative practice. The point of
meditation isn’t to focus on a object
(or a ﬂickering candle), but actually
feel at peace.
Tea makes you strong and healthy,
without any of the artiﬁcialities or
ﬁckle synthesis. Just the way mother
nature intended. From leaf to clay. In
harmony.
It is a part of our daily lives, what if
we actually questioned and thought
about the ‘why’. Why the tradition of
tea. In a world where modern utopia
is on the surface overtaking zeitgeist,
the core remains entrenched in
tradition. Chai matters.
For tea, over which many
humourous observations
and reﬂections were made.
I hope the link between
tea, meditation and life
is unclear. Because
in life, you’ve got to
master your own
mind in medita-
tion over tea,
instead of
listening to
a lost cause
ramble on.

Tea: A taste of harmony

FRIDAY 24 MAY
I still cherish the memory of the ﬁrst
meeting of the IC Heads of Depart-
ments I attended – it was both
educational and amusing.. Having
received the invitation, my predeces-
sor immediately tried to dissuade me
from accepting it; nobody expected the
Librarian to discuss College business,
shamefully I would be the odd one out
among the Heads.
Naturally, I immediately decided to
go, taking the risk to be the odd one out,
not on account of being the Librarian
but being the only woman on the list
of participants. The Rector, Eric Ash,
was the ﬁrst person to realize this,
valiantly rising to the challenge: after
rapping his gavel and emitting a sten-
torian cry: “Gentlemen”, he looked at
Farewell to HOST
me and added “and Magda”. The dis-
cussion included, as almost always,
the ﬁnancial prospects of the College;
how much income the departments
were expected to earn, and how the
departments which did not bring in
suﬃcient money would be supported.
The Library was always a special case
because of the disproportionately high
cost of scientiﬁc journals, but everyone
around the table agreed that journals
were the life-blood of research and that
their subscription must continue.
We also debated the position of
HOST (History of Science and Tech-
nology), the relatively modest cost of
maintaining three to four members
of staﬀ teaching and undertaking re-
search which was acknowledged as
outstanding and seamlessly ﬁtting into
the high academic standard of the Col-
lege. To my amazement and delight,
the Heads of the major, internation-
ally respected departments stood up,
one after the other and declared their
support for HOST. They ﬁrmly stated
that current achievements in science
had been built on the foundation laid
by our predecessors. That there is a
continuity of scientiﬁc discoveries, and
that the past belongs to us, it is there-
fore our duty to keep its memory alive.
What better way to do that than to
maintain HOST? I felt that I was wit-
nessing something unique: the declara-
tion of solidarity of scientists both past
and present.
It was, therefore, with great sadness
that I have learned of the transfer of
HOST to King’s College London. I am
sure that there must have been a se-
rious debate in College regarding the
decision and it is not my intension to
question why this had to happen. The
memory of that Heads of Departments
meeting, however, will stay with me
forever, the image of a magnanimous
College ﬁrmly believing in “one cul-
ture” – science and arts combined –
which few institutions were ever able
to demonstrate. What remains now is
to say farewell to HOST, wishing it a
happy and prosperous future – alas, in
another institution.
