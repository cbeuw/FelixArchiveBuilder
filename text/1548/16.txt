Big Headlines & Little Englanders
Padraic Calpin gives you an update on recent happenings in British politics.
Though everyone seems to be
resigned to the Coalition trundling
along to 2015, there’s still a bite
to British (though perhaps more
speciﬁcally English) politics. It’s been
a tumultuous month, with waves
of Tory rebellion unsettling David
Cameron and the guﬀawing face of
Farage barely oﬀ the front pages.
From
Eastleigh to
the Third of
May
The focus of all the noise is a newly
buoyant UKIP, having jumped 6-8
points in opinion polls in the last
couple of weeks after some years
bubbling around 10% support. The
sudden surge came just as English
voters prepared to go to the polls
and elect their district and county
councillors, and appeared to be
more than borne out; UKIP secured
some 23% of the vote, gaining 139
councillors and splitting majorities in
traditional Conservative heartlands
such as Kent and Lincolnshire.
The trouble began in March, in
the by-election held following Chris
Huhne’s sentencing over swapping
speeding points. Eastleigh, nestled in
the county of Hampshire, has been
a Lib-Dem seat since ‘94, with the
bulk of the vote split between the two
Coalition partners. But, a bullish UKIP
turned the tables, cutting swathes out
of the Lib-Dem and Tory vote to soar
into second place, some 24 points
higher than their result in 2010.
Despite Eastleigh being fought
overwhelmingly on local concerns,
it prompted a bout of back-bench
grumbling within the Conservatives
that has kept UKIP on the front pages
for weeks. As the murmurs of dissent
seep further up the party, every article
speculates on attempts to woo voters;
the Tories and the British press seem
to be doing UKIP’s work for them.
At the heart of the unrest is Europe,
something Cameron hoped to have
laid to rest in January with a promised
referendum. And yet, while Eastleigh’s
UKIP supporters spoke of fears about
immigration and unemployment, the
EU question seemed curiously absent.
Polling from IPSOS Mori reveals it’s in
fact only the 5th most important issue
to a UKIP voter, well behind other
factors. But, while Cameron did oﬀer
words on being tough on crime in the
run up to the local elections, it was
all but drowned out amidst the EU
squabbles.
4 Party
Politics?
As the results rolled in, the media
commentariat were quick to
pronounce the arrival of ‘4 Party
Politics’ to the UK; once again,
it seemed people were vying to
make UKIP’s PR team redundant.
Because, away from the press and
the Conservative rebels fanning the
ﬂames, the actual hard data from the
local elections doesn’t support such a
statement.
For one, these were English
elections. In Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland 4 party politics
has long been a reality. What’s more,
in Scotland and Northern Ireland,
UKIP’s poll performance is poor to
nonexistent. Just last week Farage
found himself surrounded by an
antagonistic crowd in Edinburgh, who
were quick to dismiss his accusations
of being “Anti-English”, insisting they
were protesting his “Bigoted, English
Nationalism”.
Then there’s the results themselves.
Whereas their overall performance,
gaining around a quarter of the vote,
is certainly signiﬁcant, the council by
council breakdown reveals a much
more fractured picture.
Rural English counties are a long
standing Tory heartland; even in
the north of England, councils are
historically split with ‘No Overall
Control’ by a single party. In these
contested Northern counties, UKIP
registered some 2 new councillors
out of 433 up for election. In the west
Midlands, too, gains were modest; 2
seats here, 6 there.
It was in the east Midlands and
South that UKIP made a signiﬁcant
showing, edging into Conservative
majorities and, in places such as
Norfolk and Lincolnshire, pulling
enough councillors to nudge the
county into ‘No Overall Control’.
So, the overall picture given by the
data is UKIP edging into councils
across England, often where they
previously had no councillors
whatsoever, and in a few regions
becoming a signiﬁcant opposition.
And yet, when considering the
signiﬁcance of all this we have to
remember that these elections are only
in rural England, in Tory heartlands.
The seats UKIP won were leached
away from the Conservatives; in more
Labour leaning counties, UKIP made
no appearance whatsoever. In many
regions, Labour also increased its
share of councillors. And in the South
Shield’s by-election, triggered by
David Miliband’s resignation and held
Bursting the
Bubble
The South Shields result in particular
gives a picture of the reality of the
UKIP position. Their appearance in
the local elections is signiﬁcant, but it
does not translate into a party on the
verge of entering Westminster. Pulling
predominantly from dissatisﬁed Tory
voters, UKIP hasn’t so much surged as
poked its nose in, doubtless beneﬁting
from the free publicity aﬀorded by the
Conservative rebellion.
The rise of Nigel Farage cannot
be ignored; unlike, for example, the
Green party, UKIP has demonstrated
a surprisingly broad reach. However,
a more sober analysis is called for.
UKIP’s gains are tied to a wider debate
long overdue in British politics,
considering the rise of the ‘Political
Class’ and its estrangement from
the majority of British society. This
question cannot be ignored, but also
cannot be addressed by a London-
centric media keeping Farage’s face in
the public eye.
on the same day, the UKIP surge was
driven by huge cuts into the Coalition
parties, with Labour’s vote share
barely dented.
News from around the world
Obama, the new Nixon?
Obama has found himself in some
trouble over the past few weeks.
After being accused of sexism for
calling the new attorney general
the “best-looking”, Obama faced
embarrassment as his gun background
check bill was defeated in the Senate,
a strong victory for gun lobbies.
More recently, the Justice
Department has been accused of
spying on Associated Press (AP)
journalistsbyobtainingmonthsworth
of phone records. This has highlighted
the growing worry regarding the
relations of the White House, the
press and respecting its freedom and
the First Amendment.
Obama has since been described as
a 21st Century Richard Nixon, tainting
an already troublesome beginning to
his second term.
Marriage for All
The Commons passed the same sex
Huffington Post
marriage bill for England and Wales
and French President Francois Hollande
signed the law allowing gay marriage
and adoption. Gay marriage in France
has seen a strong response for both
pro- and anti- groups. The passing of
the law has led to uproar from far-right
groups. A renowned French historian
has committed suicide in protest. A rally
is planned for Sunday to protest against
the law.
Tories Torn over EU
David Cameron found himself once
again in the spotlight after Michael Gove
and Philip Hammond declared they
would vote to leave the EU. The spin
game begins and the Prime Minister is
attempting to present a united Party and
Coallition front on the European ques-
tion. It’s like watching an episode of The
Thick Of It all over again.
Iranian Elections in June
600 people have registered to stand
for the role of President, with only
eight allowed to run. President
Ahmadinejad will be stepping down.
Little political change is expected as
the candidates are mostly hardline
conservatives.
