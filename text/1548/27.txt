In a near-repeat performance of his
previous match as captain, stand-in
skipper Vignesh Venkateshwaran led
a squad with a depleted batting line
up to a 58-run victory over a much-
vaunted St. Mary’s side who had re-
corded some big wins of their own
leading up to this match. Imperial
was put in to bat first on a slowish
track with some variable bounce.
Juhin Patel anchored the innings
with a solid 75 off 134 balls, nearly
carrying his bat. After a stern pep-
talk with Juhin about not getting
caught playing an on-drive, the skip-
per , coming in 1-down, promptly
managed to get dismissed in that
exact fashion for a duck. Every dark
cloud has a silver lining however,
and in this case the wicket heralded
the arrival of club president Sid-
dharth Kohli to the crease.
Looking absolutely “village”
sporting a sun-hat and basketball
sneakers along with a standard
revision-paunch, he proceeded to
systematically dismantle the op-
position’s bowling attack, taking a
particular liking to a certain legspin-
ner who hence finished with 1 for 61
off his 10 overs. Ironically, that one
wicket was that of Siddharth him-
self, who had made his way to 49 off
42 balls without realising how close
he was to a half-century. He hence
attempted to heave a flighted de-
livery, only to pop it up straight in
the air for a straightforward catch,
breaking the hearts of his teammates
and inducing a rare smile from the
opposition. Some ordinary batting
followed before Juhin finally fell af-
ter his long vigil.
Shezad Ahmed played a handy
knock down the order with most of
the tail for company. He batted with
the classic elegance of a left-hander,
firm in defence against good balls
but very severe on those in the hit-
ting zone, with most of such deliver-
ies being promptly dispatched over
cow corner. A few heart-in-mouth
moments occurred, particularly
with Shezad and Darshan “Zombie”
Patel being dropped off successive
deliveries. Finally, with the perfect
forward defence of Simon Mitchell
holding up one end, Shezad struck a
few lusty blows to finish not out on
39. Imperial posted a daunting 207
for 9, which we felt was more than
enough to defend with our bowling
attack.
The second innings was anchored
by one of the opposition’s opening
batsmen, who finished with a hard-
fought 57. After his whirlwind knock
down the order, Shezad took the first
wicket following a good accurate
spell of bowling, and he was ably
supported by Simon from the other
end, who toiled hard on an unhelpful
track. The balance was shifting ever
so slightly towards our opposition,
but the introduction of spin changed
that completely. Makhan Gill helped
himself to a wicket, before Siddharth
capped off a Man-of-the-match
peformance with 4 for 29 off 8 overs.
The captain Vignesh took the re-
sponsibility of bowling to the two
set batsmen from the other end and
dismissed both the set opener for 57
as well as a middle-order stalwart
for 32, finishing with figures of 4 for
23 off 8.5 overs. Barring a couple of
misfields and some tough chances
put down by Siddharth, the field-
ing display was generally imperious,
and ultimately it was a long spell of
quick, quiet overs which delieverd
the victory for ICUCC as St.Mary’s
crumbled to 149 all out.

On a ﬁne English summer’s day –
with temperatures soaring to 10 de-
grees, 11 of the bravest and ﬁercest
Imperial cricketers stepped onto the
sacred Harlington turf we call home
to battle UCL, led by the one and
only Will Baker. With heavy cloud
cover and strong winds, UCL were
put into bat.
We were looking to improve on our
start against them last year – 7 runs
0 balls bowled. It didn’t prove to be
too diﬃcult. The tone of the game
was set in the third over when Viggy
Venkateswaran castled their only
batsman with a loopy full toss. From
then on Umar Minhas kept pegging
away at the tail – picking up the only
decent wickets – while the spinners
kept beating the batsmen with their
ﬂight – diﬃcult to judge after the
second bounce – the special wicket
taking ball in Viggy Venkataraman’s
arsenal. Ganesh Kumar was steam-
ing in the whole way through – with
some good overs and then showing
us all how a catch should really be
taken!
17 overs and 6 wickets later – with
UCL tottering at 80/6 – in walked
Mr. Cricket. The only man with
proper whites and would you believe
it, he had his own bat! Taking guard
he looked like the complete bats-
man. Had they reversed their batting
order? 20 dot balls and 10 play and
misses later our question was an-
swered: no they hadn’t!
Soon after the departure of Mr.
Cricket – UCL tumbled and were
packed away for 110 in 29 overs with
Darvin Davis skittling the tail.
Lomas Persad and Yash Verma
strolled out stuﬀed on the low budget
and extremely sugary teas. Chasing
111 in 50 overs – the pressure was
on us from the very ﬁrst ball. With
the help of some average bowling Lo-
mas and Yash raced to 50 in 6 overs.
Along came their trump card – our
supposed kryptonite – but even he
was no match for Lomas who took
20 oﬀ his over, dispatching him to all
ends of the ﬁeld.
Some classy batting followed and
we chased down the total within 14
overs with Lomas ending up with a
well deserved 59*(37) and Yash with
41* (40), thus completing a perfect
day of cricket and an impeccable
start to the season for Imperial 2’s.
