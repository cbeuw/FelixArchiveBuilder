SEX AROUND THE CITY
SEX TOYS / DRESSUP
This year we wanted to ﬁnd out all
about your sex toys. How many of you
have a cheeky little device hidden in
the bottom of a drawer? Maybe you
have it in pride of place on your man-
telpiece. Probably not. Regardless of
where you keep it, it was interesting to
note their use.
We found that 25% of people used
sex toys of some kind. 19% of men
and 34% of women used them (not
too shocking there). Interestingly 90%
of virgins didn’t use sex toys. If you’re
in a relationship you’re twice as likely
to be using a rampant rabbit or other
such device. It seemed like straight
people were much less likely to use
sex toys than their gay, lesbian, and
bisexual counterparts.
It seems that those of you that in-
dulge in sex toys are adventurous
enough to use them with your part-
ners as well, with the “On your part-
ner” and “On both” options totalling
around 2/3 of responses.
Whether sex toys make you hap-
pier or not is debatable. We’re at Im-
perial, so we’ll give you the ﬁgures.
32% of people who are happy or very
happy with their sex lives use sex toys,
whereas 14% of the unhappy or very
unhappy were using sex toys. 44% of
women who were very happy used sex
toys. So, if you want to make your girl

THREESOMES
Wanking, frigging, adjusting the an-
tenna, shining the diamond, scratch-
ing the patch, cleaning the riﬂe, and
many other euphemisms describe this
section. That’s right Imperial, how of-
ten do you masturbate?
As society leads us to believe, men
are complete wankers with 24% of
male survey respondents admitting to
a daily rub and a whopping 42% cele-
brating themselves a few times a week.
In fact a total of 83% of male survey
takers shake it out at least once a week.
Maybe think before shaking hands
with the next guy you meet!
What is interesting to notice is how
few men live hands free, with only
2% of male respondents having some
quality alone time only a few times a
year and almost managing to mastur-
bate less than that (or possibly not at
all).
But what of the girls, you ask? Well it
seems that the ladies lead more fulﬁll-
ing lives with less boredom, leading to
only 3% of females saying they mastur-
bate daily and 17.5% taking themselves
to task a few times a week. Combining
the results we see that 39.7% of women
at Imperial masturbate at least once a
week, in other words less than half of
the male equivalent.
In contrast to their male counter-
parts 25% of female survey respond-
ents take part in self-gratiﬁcation less
than a few times a year or not at all. A
lack of availability to comment on this
section means that we can only specu-
late whether this is because of diﬀer-
ences in sexuality, lifestyles or just less
boredom!
People who choose not to identify as
male or female formed a much smaller
number of respondents, so the data is
not as reliable. However of this group
33% did not wish to divulge their mas-
turbation habits, while 20% claimed a
daily self-devotion.
By department, well, it seems Civil
Engineering are the biggest wankers.
They nearly reached 30% masturbat-
ing daily. When you next go to shake
hands with the person designing a
building, perhaps think twice about
it. ESE masturbated the least, possibly
because they are all in relationships
with each other (see analysis of rela-
tionships).
When it came to watching porn, it
was a clear split. 68% of men watch
porn weekly, whereas only 11% of
women did. By department, Materials

“‘Daily’ is the

“I have had
sex in trafal-

18% are finding places on cam-
pus to get jiggy with it. Some of
you seem far too keen to avoid
beds. Felix isn’t aware of any kind
of housing crisis, so why 19 of you
have had to have sex in Reynold’s
Bar is a mystery. It’s the very pub-
lic locations that confuse us. How
have 18 of you had sex in Ethos’
Pool? We don’t want to know ac-
tually. Blackett is the most popu-
lar department building, 29 of you
have been at it there. Frankly, we
all want to stop thinking about

It seems that threesomes are a lot less
common that you might have heard.
Just 9% of all survey respondents
claim to have taken part in a three-
some, with the number of these stu-
dents from Biomedical Engineering
and Chemical Engineering not being
high enough to have their own inter-
nal departmental threesomes. Surpris-
ingly Materials comes out on top as the
most adventurous (no pun intended),
with a whopping 24% of Materials re-
spondents claiming to have taken part
in a threesome. While this might seem
wild, we have to, as always, consider
the possible skew these results contain
due to the people most likely to take
part. Then again who knows, it might
be worth popping your head in at the
Royal School of Mines. Second place
is reserved for EEE who scored 16%
while Mech Eng came third with 13%.
What does it take to have a three-
some? Probably guts, alcohol and
an inquisitive nature. This of course
doesn’t mean you are any more or less
ofapersonfortakingpartinabedroom
situation with multi-
ple partners. After
all some people have
diﬀerent opinions
on threesomes and
they don’t always
end happily. As well
as the possibility of
being an exciting,
sweaty experience
that leaves you smil-
ing, a threesome can
also be emotionally
damaging especially
if there is a friend-
ship or relationship
involved.
Adding numbers
to the mix almost
12% of Imperial
males have been in-
volved with a three-
some in comparison to just under 7%
of females which might shine a light
on how a signiﬁcant number of Im-
perial threesomes are split by gender.
However apparently 23.5% of men
and 35.5% of women have been asked
for a threesome, while 20.5% of males
and 10% of females have been the ones
asking. So it seems that guys at Impe-
rial are much more keen on the idea of

They must just think that three is com-

Well, moving on to London loca-
tions. It seems that a lot of you are
confusing your life for an episode
of Skins by having sex in a park.
An impressive number managed
to do the deed on the street. The
other locations that were given
were certainly impressive to say
the least. The Tube!? That’s just
confusing, some commuters and
tourists must have been treated to
a more eventful journey then they
planned.
Sex around London

(erm, eww)
are watching the most porn, but aren’t
masturbating the most... Interesting.
One interesting thing came up. If
you masturbate a lot of are also likely
to be unhappy with your sex life. If you
masturbate a few times a week or less
you are 15% more likely to be unhappy
with your sex life than people mas-
turbating weekly or more. So perhaps
masturbating regularly is an indicator
that you are unhappy with your sex life.
give her sex life an A* rating, buy a sex
toy maybe?
The majority of you that have sex
toys own vibrators, which perhaps
means that Imperial students are so
busy that when they want to spice up
things in the bedroom (alone or with
a partner) they want it done for them.
205 people said they had a vibrator,
compared to the 105 who had a dildo.
Finally, we would like to advise one
respondent that “putting a hamster up
[your] bum” does not count as a sex
toy, and is certainly not safe.
Dressup is mainly reserved for
DramSoc and Musical Theatre it
seems. A sole one person said they
dressed up “all of the time” and an-
other one person said they dressed up
“most of the time”. Presumably, most
of that was with the person walking
around in a gimp suit 24/7.
“I thought this survey
would encapsulate broader
attitudes towards sex, and
not assume one is taking part
in sexual activity. There are
many others in my position
who are saving sex for a
long-lasting and loving
relationship. A chance to
share intimacy and something
very special with one person.
Within marriage... Cultural/
religious reasons don’t
“affect” my sex life. I look
forward to great sex from my
wedding night and beyond.
No baggage!!”
“Had sex in St. James’ park
during the summer, after
dark, while beach volley
ball was going on in Horse
Guards Parade.”
“Great Hall, on the stage,
try it someday.”
“We had sex in the
changing rooms in REISS on
Oxford Street.”
“Did this [Felix Sex Survey]
in the library. Turn to see a
stranger standing behind me
peeking. He gives me a wink
and leaves. FML”
