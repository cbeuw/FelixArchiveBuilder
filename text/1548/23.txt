12. Iron Man 3
Worldwide gross: $1,035,973,000
Why? It hasn‚Äôt even been a full month
since its release, and yet here sits
Tony Stark‚Äôs third outing, proudly at
number 13 in the highest worldwide
grossing Ô¨Ålms of all time. You can
expect the Ô¨Ålm to climb up several
spots at the end of this summer. Stark
(played by the irreplaceable Robert
Downey Jr.) is without a doubt
the most popular character of the
Marvel Universe, and given the great
big success of Avengers Assemble,
immediately following that record-
breaker no doubt helped boost the
overall numbers. It‚Äôs raking in money
from China ($64 million + opening
weekend ‚Äì highest ever), after a
special-cut featuring local actors and
scenes appear to be going down well
with audiences there.
11. Pirates of the
Caribbean: On Stranger
Tides
Worldwide gross: $1,043,871,802
Why? After the dud that was At
World‚Äôs End where very little made
sense, Disney commissioned another
outing for Captain Jack Sparrow
(Johnny Depp ‚Äì always the reliable
blockbuster box office draw),
retaining very few of its original
characters (Geoffrey Rush stayed on
‚Äì hurrah). Business in the States was
disappointing to say the least, falling
massively short of its predecessors,
but it‚Äôs the international market
that contributed to $800 million
of its total gross. Italy poured in an
impressive $108 million into the Ô¨Ånal
count, with the next highest coming
from China with $70 million.
10. Toy Story 3
Worldwide gross: $1,063,171,911
Why? Dubbed as a Ô¨Ålm that would
make even grown men cry, this was
one of the best reviewed Ô¨Ålms of
2010 (Rottentomatoes places a 99%
fresh rating), as well as the highest
grossing Ô¨Ålm of 2010 (both in the
States and internationally). The kids
loved it, and frankly, so did the adults,
with many young adults reminiscing
the days they watched their Ô¨Årst two
Toy Story Ô¨Ålms as children back in the
90s. Everyone loves and trusts Pixar
to come up with something witty and
heart-warming time and time again.
Also beneÔ¨Åtting from the 3D push,
it had very little competition (if at
all) in its Ô¨Årst two weeks (Jonah Hex,
Grown Ups, Knight & Day), in which
the Ô¨Ålm generated $250 million in the
States alone.
9. Pirates of the
Caribbean: Dead Man‚Äôs
Chest
Worldwide gross: $1,066,179,725
Why? The Curse of the Black Pearl
was such a huge hit that greenlighting
sequels couldn‚Äôt have been a difficult
decision ‚Äì and with the full cast on
board, only success was in store
for this immediate sequel. Its 2006
opening numbers, $135 million, was a
record-setter, smashing Spider-man‚Äôs
4-year reign at that point. It ruled the
top for three straight weeks, and was
the fastest Ô¨Ålm to earn $100 million,
$200 million and $300 million back
in 2006 (all these records have since
been smashed but for a non-3D, non-
superhero themed picture, this was
quite an achievement seven years
ago).
3. Avengers Assemble
Worldwide gross: $1,511,757,910
Why? Raking in $207 million, this
holds the record for the best North
American opening. Ever since the Ô¨Årst
couple of Iron Man Ô¨Ålms convinced
Marvel to pursue something bigger
and bolder, every Ô¨Ålm before
Avengers Assemble (Thor, Captain
America, The Incredible Hulk) has
been hinting at a possible massive
group project. Finally hitting the
screens in 2012, Joss Wheon of Buffy/
Angel/Firefly fame certainly did not
disappoint. Undoubtedly the biggest
movie event of 2012, a long list of
records were smashed, although
it didn‚Äôt fly as high as some were
anticipating (i.e. didn‚Äôt reach number
1 internationally). But being number 3
is still incredible, and with a sequel on
the way, perhaps that can aim higher.
2. Titanic
Worldwide gross: $2,185,372,302
Why? From this point on, we‚Äôre
only dealing with Ô¨Ålms that have
crossed the TWO billion dollar line.
Only two Ô¨Ålms have done so, both
directed by the same man, James
Cameron that show-off. Well, where
to start with this one ‚Äì there was the
Leo-fever, where women worldwide
couldn‚Äôt get enough of its leading
star, Leonardo DiCaprio, there was
that song ‚ÄòMy Heart Will Go On‚Äô,
the tragic love story, plus the Ô¨Ånal
spectacular hour of where the ship
sinks, killing a whole load of people
along with it. This holds the record
for spending the most number of
consecutive weeks (15) at the number
one spot in the North American box
office, and even in its 3D re-release,
people loved it ‚Äì 15 years on.
1. Avatar
Worldwide gross: $2,782,275,172
Why? It‚Äôs the same pattern with
James Cameron ‚Äì there is a lot of talk
surrounding his new project, because
it‚Äôs so ambitious. A trailer is released,
everyone hates it and guarantees that
his latest big-budget epic will tank
severely and won‚Äôt make any money.
Andyetoncereleased,he‚Äôsthekingof
the world. (Unadjusted for inflation),
no Ô¨Ålm in the history of Hollywood
has crossed $700 million in America,
and neither has foreign gross crossed
$2 billion, until Cameron came along
with his blue Na‚Äôvis and took over
the 2009 Christmas season with his
new Ô¨Ålm. Despite stiff competition
from Sherlock Holmes and Alvin and
the Chipmunks, audiences just could
not be kept away from what would
become the biggest Ô¨Ålm of all time.
8. The Dark Knight
Rises
Worldwide gross: $1,084,439,099
Why? The Aurora shooting might
have put a bit of a dent in the North
American box office numbers (this
one falls $90 million short from its
predecessor in the States) but any
Ô¨Ålm with words ‚ÄúChristopher Nolan‚Äù
and ‚Äúepic conclusion‚Äù was bound to
make a boat-load of cash and it did,
with its top foreign market coming
from the United Kingdom with a
Ô¨Ånal tally of $90 million + (2nd best
of 2012). Its rather long running time
(165 minutes) as well as its dark,
depressing undertone were not at all
off-putting it seems, and very loyal
online fanboys (there are lots) were
ferociously attacking anyone who
had a bad word to say about the Ô¨Ålm.
