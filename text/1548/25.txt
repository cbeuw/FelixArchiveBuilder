This week Uranus is in its 6th
house. This is its favourite
house; the one in the country
with the shooting range and
lake. This rare astrological
event means that you will fail
all your exams and spiral into
a black hole of despair while
everyone in your project
group bitches about how you
aren’t pulling your weight.
Thisweekyoucan’tunderstand
why your housemates love Fifa
so much. You conclude they
have been brainwashed by a
pixelated Lionel Messi, and
smash up their screen to free
them from their trance. They
feel angry rather than liberated,
but at least they might have
time clean more now the TV’s
broken. Every cloud…
This week the brightness of
Jupiter means that your cum
will turn blue on the eve of the
25th. It will permanently stain
anything it touches, includ-
ing your favourite wank sock.
Wait, is that blue on your lips?
Now everyone knows you like
to taste your own ejaculate
(or can suck yourself off in
which case, fair enough).
This week you grow an ex-
treme female equivalent of
a revision beard. When you
finish exams, your lady gar-
den has grown so thick and
matted that you are unable
to trim it, and there is no way
through the curly forest for
any potential explorers. You
are doomed to a life of kera-
tin-induced celibacy.
This week Pluto’s view of the
sun is eclipsed by Earth. Cold
and excluded, Pluto vows
revenge by exiting orbit and
colliding with the Arctic ice
mass. All the ice melts, and
sea levels rise so much that
anyone not climbing Mount
Everest is submerged in a sea
of screaming bodies. How
long can you tread water?
This week your favourite
exam pen stabs you in the
eye, blinding you. You are
heartbroken that your rela-
tionship could end in such
a bitter way after all the
clammy 3 hour embraces
you have shared. Joke’s on
it though, as you’ll have no
need for it now you have to
write in Braille.
This week Saturn’s moons
are aligned, a sure sign that
your toe hairs will get crabs.
They nestle in the skin folds
where your toe joint is, revel-
ling in the cheesy moistness.
You try to burn them off with
acid but your whole toe dis-
solves while they crawl up
your leg in search of a hairier
resting place.
This week, you seek peace and
quiet for revision in the network
of tunnels under Imperial. But
vicious glowing rats, fluores-
cent as a result of an unhappy
love tryst between genetically
engineered mice and a horny
sewer rodent, seek you out and
nibble you to shreds before
your flesh becomes sour with
asbestos contamination.
This week, you wish that your
horoscope would predict fame
and fortune for once. But the
stars don’t lie: you are doomed
to fail at life and love. You real-
ise that if you were less intelli-
gent, you might lack the neural
connections necessary to rec-
ognise failure. So you cut out
your brain and subsist in eter-
nal vegetative ignorance.
This week you get food poi-
soning the morning of your
last exam. Your insides erupt
all over your answer booklet
about 2 hours in, destroy-
ing any marks you may have
managed to get. What’s
worse, you now have to can-
cel your summer trip around
Thailand so you can do re-
takes. Pint?
This week the library printer
is so fed up of printing badly-
written coursework that it swal-
lows you whole and holds
you hostage in paper tray 2. It
starts flashing error messages
in Morse code to communicate
the ransom for your release,
but no one understands so it
drowns you in ink and spits you
out while flashing ‘paper jam’.
This week you must choose
between two pets: a squirrel
that constantly pelts you with
acorns, or a meerkat that
constantly humps your leg.
On the one hand, the acorns
could seriously deplete your
brain cells, while on the oth-
er, a jizzing meerkat would
cost a fortune in cleaning
bills. What’s it going to be?

Hangman’s Finest College News Source
the turnip
Hot on the heels of the internation-
ally acclaimed bouncy castle and pet-
ting zoo on the Queen’s Lawn, Impe-
rial College Union has announced,
in junction with Imperial College a
college-wide Nerf war.
Scheduled to start on Monday 3rd
June, with the assassination of the
Rector, there is only one rule – the
last department standing wins. All
students that participate in the con-
ﬂict, and survive, will receive an au-
tomatic 70% in all exams taken this
term. Treachery will be rewarded by
a Nerf ﬁring squad, followed by their
name being added to the roster for the
end of term fruit-pelting.
The warzone is spread over the
whole campus, with College security
monitoring the war, to identify casu-
alties, and record death tolls. There
are no safe areas on campus, and the
College will be open 24/7 during this
period of conﬂict.
Weapons and darts will be sup-
plied at the start of the week, through
weapon caches hidden throughout the
campus – each department will con-
tain one crate of projectile weapons,
and one of melee weapons. Weapon
drops may be called in to Queen’s
Lawn. For those of you who wish to
ﬁght for the glory of your department,
yet have no training, the Union will
be hosting a ﬁring range and weapon
safety school, during lunchtimes of
next week.
The College and Union will accept
no liability for failed exams or nem-
eses created during this time.
Imperial full of nerfs
