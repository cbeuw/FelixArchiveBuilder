16. The Dark Knight
Worldwide gross: $1,004,558,444
Why? Anticipation was through the
roof for Christopher Nolan’s follow-
up to his highly praised Batman
Begins and the press coverage on the
sudden death of its star Heath Ledger
certainly put the ﬁlm on a lot of the
front headlines. His outstanding
performance as the Joker (he won an
Oscar for playing a Batman villain –
this never happens) was every ﬁlm
critic’s talking point, and the overall
reviews could not have been more
ecstatic. Its opening weekend was
the highest on record at that point,
and it held steadily on, slipping very
little throughout subsequent weeks,
although in a cheeky move, the studio
did re-release the ﬁlm in the States to
push its total money intake past that
billion line.
The Billion Do
Congratulations are in order for Iron
Man 3 and its associated Marvel Uni-
verse, as within 3 weeks of its inter-
national release date, the third Tony
Stark picture has already generated
more than one billion dollars at the
worldwide box oﬃce. Robert Downey
Jr.’s latest eﬀort joins a surprisingly
long list of ﬁlms that have already
done so, although to his credit, a lot of
the ﬁlms on the list reached the mile-
stone near the end of their box oﬃce
runs. Given Iron Man 3 still has a
long way to go before it is pulled from
the theatres, we can expect the ﬁlm
to keep moving up in its total gross.
And although Downey Jr.’s return for
a possible fourth adaptation remains
in doubt, Marvel Studios president
Kevin Feige expects the Iron Man
franchise to remain “as evergreen as
James Bond.”
But to celebrate the biggest money-
making ﬁlms so far, Felix Film takes a
look at just what made each and every
one of them so special that audiences
worldwide ﬂocked to the theatres to
watch them on the big screen.
15. The Hobbit: An
Unexpected Journey
Worldwide gross: $1,017,003,568
Why? With Peter Jackson returning
behind the cameras to take us back
to Middle Earth, no LOTR fan would
have said no to this. There were
concerns over Jackson splitting a
rather thin book into three ﬁlms but
this gamble seems to have paid off
since the ﬁrst in a trilogy has already
made a billion. No matter how long
or seemingly dull, Jackson’s visual
mastery is always worth catching on
the big screen. This also enjoyed the
big Christmas and end-of-year push,
typically the hot-spots for studios
to release their big epic ﬁlms. And
let’s not forget about the brilliant
Andy Serkis, without whom Gollum
wouldn’t exist.
14. Alice in Wonderland
Worldwide gross: $1,024,299,904
Why? Summer came early in 2010
as audiences rushed to the screens
to keep their important date with
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The
Burton-Depp pairing is one that is
hugely appealing given the right
accessible source material (so no,
ﬁlms like Ed Wood don’t cross the
billion mark). This was smartly
marketed by Disney as a colourful,
all-round fun experience for the
whole family, whilst also cashing in
on the then-newly booming business
of adding an extra dimension and
therefore throwing in some glasses
and a couple of quid to the ticket
prices. Outstanding international
ticket sales came from Japan, where
it grossed $130 million + (its 11th best
non-Japanese ﬁlm).
13. Star Wars Episode I:
The Phantom Menace
Worldwide gross: $1,027,044,677
Why? Everyone loves to hate the new
Star Wars ﬁlms, and it all started here,
with a billion-dollar grossing prequel.
George Lucas, in his high and mighty
standing in Hollywood, was paid an
unbelievable sum of $400,000,000 in
total for his efforts on the ﬁlm - that’s
more than a lot of ﬁlms even dream
of making in their run. Because of
the phenomenal hype surrounding
the ﬁlm, few major studios dared
releasing anything in the same week
as Lucas’ big space comeback. An
estimated number of 2.2 million full-
time employees missed work days to
attend the ﬁlm – it was that much of
an exciting ﬁlm event. The 2012 3D
re-release helped surpass one billion.
7. Skyfall
Worldwide gross: $1,108,561,013
Why? 007 was in dire need of a fresh
new start even since Quantum of
Solace came out and ruined whatever
good that was set up from Casino
Royale. With Sam Mendes stepping
into the director role, Daniel Craig
returning, a meaty sub-plot for the
ﬁercely talented national treasure
Judi Dench, plus that Adele song,
many agree that Skyfall is the best
007 ﬁlm yet. As UK’s highest grossing
ﬁlm of all time, 007’s home country
added a whopping $160 million + to
its international total, and the rest
of Europe (France and Germany in
particular) followed, with China also
not far behind. With Christopher
Nolan now in talks to direct the next
one, can this record be broken in a
few years’ time?
6. The Lord of the
Rings: The Return of
the King
Worldwide gross: $1,119,929,521
Why? Peter Jackson’s Lord of the
Rings trilogy came to a fantastic close
with Return of the King, where epic
battles and emotions swept across
the screen over a 3-hour running time
– the build-up from The Fellowship
of the Ring and The Two Towers paid
off here, and sweeping the Academy
Awards in 2004 gave the ﬁlm an ever-
so slight bump in the box office. The
Christmas/end-of-year season was
alsoinplayhere,aswellasthepromise
of a grand scale and extraordinary
spectacle. One of the earliest to cross
the billion mark, when 3D wasn’t in
use, this is no doubt Jackson’s biggest
accomplishment.
5. Transformers: Dark
of the Moon
Worldwide gross: $1,123,745,996
Why? Critics hate Michael Bay,
but that’s of no trouble or any
consequence to the director, as he
will always have his loyal followers of
action-junkies who only ask for some
dumb fun, which is exactly what is
delivered here. “I make movies for
teenage boys. Oh, dear, what a crime”
he says, and it appears this is his
motto for making any of his ﬁlms. But
kudos to him – many of his ﬁlms are
consistently regarded as box office
success stories and ideal for summer
audiences, where students are out
of school. The Asian market (China,
South Korea) gave some signiﬁcant
input too, where the robot franchise
is hugely popular.
4. Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows Part 2
Worldwide gross: $1,341,511,219
Why? The ﬁnal ﬁlm of one of the
most successful ﬁlm franchises in
history, this ﬁnale conjured up $32
million worth of advance tickets,
setting a new record, whereas
the $169 million North American
opening weekend made history, until
it was beaten a year later by a group
of superheroes. More impressive (as
if the ﬁlm doesn’t have enough to
boast about), its worldwide opening
of $483 million in one weekend is
still the one to beat. Better luck next
time Avengers. Audiences loved
seeing Hogwarts get torn apart by
evil wizards/witches, and the ensuing
battle was suitably thrilling with the
large ensemble cast giving it their all.
