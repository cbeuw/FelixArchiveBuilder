Letty (Rodriguez) died. She died
right in front of our eyes when she
was shot after a car-ﬂip. We know it,
the characters know it, but running
out of fresh new ideas to carry on
with the popular vehicular franchise,
they have decided to bring her back
from the dead. But rest assured that
this isn’t the most absurd thing you’ll
see in the ﬁlm. See, The Fast & the

Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Katherine
Heigl, Amanda Seyfried, Robin
Williams, Ben Barnes, Topher Grace
Big cast, big names, big mess, big failure
Furious series isn’t exactly known for
its credibility: the more it embraces
its stupidity and its tight, succinct
structure, the better.
And to be fair, having Rodriguez
rock up out of the blue isn’t all that
bad, since she was an invaluable orig-
inal cast member – plus as a strong
grounded female, she gets to go up
against ex-MMA ﬁghter Carano in
one memorable, merciless ﬁst-ﬁght
taking place in the London Under-
ground of all places. She’s also a great
excuse for Dom (Diesel) and his gang
to come back into the racing game,
even though they promised to leave
this life behind after the birth of Bri-
an‘s (Walker) baby boy.
Turns out Letty is caught up in
some illegal activities with notorious
international criminal Owen Shaw
(Luke Evans) who is waging “vehicu-
lar warfare” against the good guys.
He drives a fancy, modiﬁed racing car
with a neatly equipped trick of ﬂip-
ping over any car that races towards
him. And it’s Dom’s job to bring her
What’s this? Katherine Heigl in yet
another underwhelming romantic
comedy? Amanda Seyfried as yet an-
other googly-eyed bride-to-be? Rob-
ert de Niro in yet another brainless
role? Diane Keaton as yet another
neurotic old woman who is unlucky
in love? Ben Barnes playing yet an-
other charming but empty shell of a
role? And is Robin Williams so out of
work that he needs to resort to play-
back, since she’s “family”. That f-word
gets tossed around so much here that
by the end of it all, you’ll get pretty
sick of hearing it, especially since it
ﬁlls up so many chunks that need-
lessly slows everything down as a
whole.
With so many good guys turning
up to form a united front, it’s the
main antagonist who has hardly any
room for himself. Evans, although an
eﬀectively smooth-talking baddie,
never has the chance to ﬂourish. As a
former-SAS you’d think he has more
to oﬀer than some driving moves –
and aside from a brief showdown
between him and Diesel, all Evans
has to do is to deliver some smug dia-
logue, something he has no problem
with handling.
Each good guy has something to
bring to the ﬁlm: Tyrese Gibson and
Ludacris are mostly there for comic
relief (some hits, some misses), Sung
Kang and have a love story going on,
Dwayne Johnson and Diesel ﬂex their
muscles, Walker is the eye-candy for
the ladies who doesn’t have much to
do in the end, whereas Rodriguez and
Carano show that girl-ﬁghts can be as
brutal, if not more, than boy-ﬁghts.
It’s over-crowded and overlong,
and the Rock’s grossly enlarged arms
deserve their own end-credit men-
tion (would NOT like to look at those
under IMAX conditions), but any
ﬁlm that pairs up Diesel and Dwayne
Johnson for a smack-down is bound
to be enjoyable – which is exactly
what this is all about. Forget about
logic, forget about how two race cars
can slide and glide around the busy,
busy central London (Piccadilly
Circus to be precise), the point is,
“they’ve got a tank” – and that’s re-
ally all you need to know.
And for die-hard fans of the fran-
chise, rest assured that the sixth out-
ing will not be this crew’s last, as the
big cliﬀhanger in a post-credits scene
shows us, there is one more venge-
ful antagonist for Dom to deal with,
played by a charismatic actor who is
very good at what he does
ing a priest for the second time? (Re-
member License to Wed? It’s best to
forget about that one) Such is the dire
concept of this horrible mess of an
ensemble comedy, a ﬁlm that boasts
having all these hugely talented stars,
but one that doesn’t give any of the
actors something interesting to work
with.
It must have sounded great on pa-
per (which could explain just how on
earth this attracted so many stars). A
remake of a French screwball comedy,
dysfunctional family, a wedding that
just will not go according to plan, sib-
lings with issues with their parents,
and two divorced adults having to act
as though they love each other for the
sake of avoiding embarrassment.
Don (De Niro) and Ellie (Keaton)
must act as though they’re still mar-
ried when their adopted Mexican son
Alejandro (Barnes) is about to be wed
to his love Missy (Seyfried); because
Alejandro’s birth mother is a devout
Catholic who doesn’t believe in di-
vorces. Don’s lover Bebe (Sarandon)
is not happy with this arrangement
and is ready to cook up a little re-
venge for her man. Also invited to the
wedding is the uptight sister of the
groom Lyla (Heigl), and the 28-year-
old virgin brother of the groom Jared
(Grace).
It’s worrying how very few jokes
actually stick, and there is absolutely
nothing remotely touching about the
various big long speeches that are
made that are supposed to hint at
nostalgia and a mature look at love.
Attempts to throw in moments of
raunchiness by unwisely peppering
the script with obscenities also fall
ﬂat, and it’s diﬃcult to see just which
demographic this ﬁlm is aimed at.
“I’d rather gouge my eyes out with
hot spoon” says De Niro at one point.
Oh the irony...
