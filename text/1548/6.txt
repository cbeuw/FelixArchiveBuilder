won a host of prizes. The first being
the VIP pass to the Shell Eco-mara-

Not For Profit Careers Fair
to take part in the event, which, like
all other careers fairs, will involve
students meeting employers at their
stands. There has been one other Not
For Proﬁt event this academic year,
which was a Not For Proﬁt Forum last
November. This was more of a confer-
ence than a traditional careers fair.
In the past there was criticism over
the way that careers fairs were run.

New Scientist Live Event
Paul Davies will be talking about a radical approach to cancer therapy.
Cancer research is a vast worldwide enterprise, yet there has been little im-
provement in patient outcomes over several decades. Clearly some bold new
thinking is needed. Amid the frantic search for an elusive “cure”, some basic
questions are overlooked. Why is there cancer? What are its deep evolution-
ary roots? Why do almost all cells come pre-loaded with a cancer subroutine?
Paul, who is the Director of the Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science
at Arizona State University, will describe a new and testable theory of cancer
as the re-activation of an ancient phenotype, suggesting a radically new ap-
proach to therapy.
Tickets cost £5
