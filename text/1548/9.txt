SEXUAL SATISFACTION
Is Imperial really as limp
as it seems?
ONLINE
With Imperial students having more
compassionate relationships with
their laptops than they do with their
lab partners, only a surprisingly low
4% (39 people) admitted to using on-
line dating websites. However, it does
seem that some of you out there could
be convinced, with 29% admitting to
considering it in the future if it does
appear rather bleak. It may be no time
before people are uploading and re-
freshing over weeping and wanking.
RELATIONSHIPS
Just how shy are we all around those
we have a soft spot for? With 56% of
girls being in a relationship at the mo-
ment, compared to 49% of the males
out there, woman are slightly taking
the lead when it comes to romance.
But how many people out there are
getting down and dirty within the
very social conﬁnes of Imperial? 51%
of those in a relationship are dating
someone else with Central library ac-
cess, meaning that the other half are
going elsewhere to get their teenage
kicks right through the night.
So with one half getting their nerd-
gasm on in between lectures and labs,
are those dating fellow Imperial stu-
dents faring any better? 93% of those
consider themselves happy or even
very happy, whereas a smaller 88% of
those indulging oﬀ campus coitus can
say the same. Making love in lab coats
may therefore have its perks.
So if you want in on this Imperial in-
fatuation, where should you start your
search? 33% of those dating some-
one at Imperial found their squeeze
in halls, with about 20% ﬁnding their
signiﬁcant other at a club or society
or dating someone from their course.
At either Union or non-Union parties
trailed behind. Perhaps missing that
night out to look over your notes and
colour co-ordinate it by subject wasn’t
such a terrible shout after all then.
Are hall seniors therefore rising to
the challenge, going above and beyond
their role? 91 people have experienced
their hall senior trying it on, whereas
52 people succumbed to their authori-
tative advances and been given more
than the average pastoral care. This
gives hall seniors a hit rate of around
1 in 2: something for Wardens to wor-
ry about, and something for socially
awkward ﬁrst years to aspire towards.
What about Departments? Well, the
most incestuous were the ESE (Earth
Sciences and Engineering) people.
22% of them are in relationships with
each other. That’s a staggering 44%
of the department. They stood head
and shoulders above the others. Next
up were humanities as the others just
aren’t alternative enough for them.
Materials were very low though, so
there’s at least one building on campus
that’s bound to be awkward. Comput-
ing, well, maybe you should close your
monitors and look at the people in
your lecture theatre: below 5% are in a
relationship with each other.
At the same time as them all being
lovey dovey with each other 20% of
ESE are not happy. Awkward.
So it seems at Imperial a lot of peo-
ple aren’t doing too badly when it
comes to ﬁnding that special some-
one. However, don’t feel that this may
hinder your chances as a singleton, as
with one comment stating, “over half
the guys I’ve slept with have had girl-
friends,” faithfulness may not be at the
top of some of the men’s agendas. This
is deﬁnitely something that needs to
be addressed in the next Sex Survey…
How many scientists are
sampling each other?
ORAL AND ANAL
Who’s getting on their knees? Well,
probably most of you. 82% were hap-
py to give oral, and 85% were happy
to receive oral. When you go down to
the gender split, 5% more men were
happy to give head. The most stun-
ning diﬀerence was in the answers
for happy to receive oral. 77% of
women and an amazing 91% of men
were happy to get head. It seems the
ﬂavoured condom need a massive ad
campaign, as nobody is using them.
Perhaps it’s the ﬂavours? 87% of peo-
ple who give/receive oral sex are us-
ing protection.
How about anal sex? Well, 32%
said that they had had anal sex. 24%
of people said that they had at one
point asked for anal sex. The gender
split for this was pronounced. 11%
of women and 32% of men said that
they had asked. In total, 30% said
that they had been asked for anal sex.
Perhaps you’re all asking each other?
Who knows. Anyway, breaking that
down by gender and you ﬁnd that
the result corresponds to the people
asking pretty well. 24% of men and
38% of women said they had been ap-
proached about anal sex.
Of the people that had had anal sex,
63% of them had asked. Don’t ask
don’t get applies then it seems. Al-
though 69% had also been asked. 84%
who hadn’t had anal sex had not been
asked for it.
So, with our infamous ratio often be-
ing quoted as a source of a lot of dis-
content, are we really as dissatisﬁed as
other student surveys are leading us
to believe?
When asking students about how
happy they are with their sex life, the
majority of students said they were
satisﬁed with their sex life, with 61%
either happy or very happy in their
bedroom endeavours. Only 15% of
students said they were dissatisﬁed
with their lacklustre sex lives.
Splitting by gender though, 67% of
all females out there are either happy
or very happy. This is not the case for
the boys, with only 55% of men feeling
the same. One in four males simply
described their attitude to their sex
life as “meh.”
So has Imperial had any inﬂu-
ence on these ﬁndings? When asked,
around 46% of students overall feel
that being at Imperial negatively af-
fects your sex life. However, when
split by gender, it was found that, ac-
tually, to the contrary, 20% of women
thought it enhanced their sex lives,
compared to only 9% of men thinking
the same. Not only that, a further 56%
of males agreed that going to Imperial
has left them rather high and forever
dry by stating Imperial has done them
no sexual favours.
Just to cover all of the bases, we
then asked if their sex life at Imperial
has had any impact on their overall
student satisfaction. It was also found
that 59% of students thought that
there wasn’t really any link between
the two. Splitting by gender again,
it does seem that the boys are again
more disgruntled than the girls, with
64% of females not considering their
sex lives a hindrance to their blos-
soming student experience, whilst
only 56% of the boys seem to think
the same. Maybe what the library can
do for some it just can’t do for others.
With women on average having
more sex per week then men, it does
seem that men are indeed feeling a bit
begrudged towards the ratio. Howev-
er, generally, the majority of students
shouldn’t seem to have a hard time
swallowing the fact that we are, gen-
erally, quite a sexually satisﬁed bunch.
For departments, 26% of Maths stu-
dents declare themselves “Unhappy
with their sex life.” They should head
over to EEE where it drops to just 5%.
Is EEE the hive of Imperial’s sex life?
43% of them have sex “Monthly or
Less” so perhaps it is.
What about those hard core fuckers
out there who ticked the ‘daily’ box
when asked how often they had? How
happy are they? 76% of them declare
themselves Very Happy. No surprises.
So next time someone publically
berates the Imperial social scene and
the lack of stimulation it may provide,
it is probable that they are actually
bumping uglys behind closed doors
(or even in that toilet upstairs in the
Union)… unless they are male.
Are students logging on
or jacking off?
Despite the obvious decline in the
number of virgins over the years as
more of the naïve ﬁrst years get around
to popping their cherry, just how many
Freshers are virgins when the arrive?
The split between the age that fe-
males and males are losing their vir-
ginity at is evident. With 27% of fe-
males losing their virginity at the age of
the 18 compared to only 18% of males,
it seems that they will be more expe-
rienced than their male counterparts.
There is also a signiﬁcant drop be-
tween the ages of 18 and 19 as ages for
virginity loss – with only 12% of girls
holding out for that extra year and 11%
of boys doing the same, this may be
inﬂuenced by the transition to univer-
sity, and also halls providing that amo-
rous atmosphere we all know and love.
This year alone saw a ﬂurry of activ-
ity within the fresher community: 28%
of the females who started this year
lost their virginity aged 18, with only
18% of those who are male doing the
same. Even after allowing for correc-
tions for those who may have started
university at a later age and those that
maybe lost their virginity before uni-
versity, it still shows a signiﬁcant dis-
crepancy between the two genders –
the men are seemingly more likely to
be virgins than the women throughout
this ﬁrst year.
It seems that some virgins at Im-
VIRGINITY
Just how fresh are the freshers?
perial traverse their maiden voyage
within the conﬁnes of halls, and even,
possibly, at the hands of the trusty hall
senior. Those who lost their virginity
at the ages of 18 and 19 also saw 7%
and 5% of them respectively having
sex with their hall senior too, although
such a correlation drawn can be seen
as rather tenuous. It does remain a
possibility, however, that 1 in 20 of stu-
dents were deﬂowered by that impres-
sively experienced second year student
on your corridor.
So if it is not the tender hands and
words of a hall senior, what else inﬂu-
ences students in losing their V plates?
When asked whether beliefs have an
inﬂuence on their sex life, 37% of peo-
ple who stated that they are virgins
also said religion has inﬂuenced their
choices sexually. This suggests that
perhaps many are choosing to remain
virgins as opposed to wanting to lose
their virginity but not being able to.
When it came to age, most lost it
at 18. However, a larger number than
you may think lost their virginity very
young. 117 people said that they have
lost their virginity at the age of 15 and
below.
The always popular virginity by de-
partment saw Medicine at the top of
the scale. Combining the virginity of
a department against the percentage
that are virgins (see graph above) you
have the people who are going to hell
on the right of the line and those who
are doing it for the hell of it on the left.
When the world of the internet
came into play, it turns out that vir-
gin are looking at naughty things less
than their non-virgin friends. 33% of
virgins said that they looked at porn
less than once a year or never. 22% of
virgins would consider online dating,
which was actually low compared to
non-virgins.
