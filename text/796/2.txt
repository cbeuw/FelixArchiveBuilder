So election time is upon us once
againâ€”as if the world and his wife
hadn't noticed already with the
number of posters that have gone up
this week. And where do little posters
come from mummy?
I can't wait for Tuesday evening
when the results are released and we
can all breath a sigh of relief or a cr,
of horror, and the FELIX Office can
return to its normal happy self.
I know all the candidates for the
sabbatical elections and, as such, I
know who I'm going to vote for and
who I would recommend but I am
bound by a code of honour not to
reveal my favorites in FELIX so
you'll just have to read the leaflets,
judge the posters and vote wisely next
week.
Also remember that you can
ABSTAIN in an election if you think
that neither candidate is suitable for
the job. Read Chas Jackson's article
on the Single Transferable Vote
system on page 7 to find out more.
Results special!
FELIX comes out twice next week.
There will be a special two (or four)
page results issue on Wednesday and
a normal issue next Friday. FELIX
brings you the results even before
they are officially announced at next
Thursday's UGM. Anything vaguely
election result-ish should be handed
to me by 8pm on Tuesday evening.
Lobbies, Lecturers and Life
Sciences
As far as I understand it, this week's
strike was called by ICU to enable
members of the Association of
University Teachers to lobby
Parliament instead of having to
lecture. I don't agree with the way
certain Life Science lecturers have
threatened students but I do feel that
it was their right to say No to
lobbying and Yes to teaching on
Tuesday. It is for their consciences.
This is a totally different issue from
their decision to having an assessed
lab on Thursday afternoon. No
department should have any course
timetabled on a Hustings Thursday
afternoon. It is something that has
been agreed between College and the
Union for several years. Any
department that ignores this
agreement deserves to have nasty
things done to it.
What does an ex-FELIX Editor do
when she has to go back to being a
student?
Answers on a small postcard please.
Office Hours
Believe it or not, the FELIX Office
does have office hours. It is open
from Monday to Friday between
9.30am and midday and then
12.30pm to 5.30pm. This is when I
am available to help anybody with
publicity or answer general enquiries.
Occasionally I may ask you to come
back at a more convenient time if it
is a Wednesday or Thursday and I am
struggling to get a FELIX paste-up
ready. The best times to come in are
Mondays and Fridays. Outside these
hours the Office is always open but
the evenings and early mornings are
only for FELIX or Print Unit
preparation work. I may commit
GBH the next time somebody comes
in at 11.30pm on a Wednesday asking
me to do ten dot-screened
photographs for their thesis or
newsletter (or election publicity,
Chas). Be nice to me and I will be
nice to you. Treat me with contempt
and that's all you'll get back.
Thanks
...to Ian/Syd Howgate/Harbour-
Bridge for collating FELIX last week.
It was appreciated.
Sorry
...to Ian/Syd Howgate/Harbour-
Bridge for the error in our front page
news story last week. It was infact the
great man himself who proposed the
'strike' motion.
Puzzles
Is there anyone out there who is mad-
keen on puzzles/crosswords/IQ tests?
If you are, how would you like to
make up some for the last FELIX of
the Spring Term (Wednesday 23rd
March)? All puzzles must be originals
and the best puzzle sent in will gain
its author a FELIX t-shirt!
Wow!
Finally
Please vote next Monday or Tuesday.
It won't take up much of your time
as there will be ballot boxes in each
department. All you will need is your
Union Card as proof of identity.
Don't be shy, it's your vote so use it.
Cliche, cliche!
