Chem Eng Soc
4.30am Monday morning and the
thought of a 300 mile coach journey
with Lonnie 'travel' to a northern
ghost town (Teeside) was hardly the
ideal start to a another Frank Morton
sports campaign. The journey was
predictably cold and we arrived with
another 22 university teams to
compete for the honour of being the
best Chem Eng team in the UK.
We drew Bradford in the first round
and the terrible journey contributed
to an even worse team performance
and IC were lucky to win in the
sudden death penalty shoot out (no
thanks to Kev Graves and Russ
Dark!).
Next round was Aston, but the pre-
match beers refreshed our various
parts and a good goal from Mark
Radley followed by good defensive
work saw us through to the quarter
finals.
The draw gave us the inevitable
grudge match against Cambridge, but
an aggressive performance and a goal
from Kev Graves put us through to
the semis against Birmingham.
By now the crowd were turning
against us (we were too well dressed,
good looking and successful for most
people's tastes) but a good goal by
Jim Wilson in his first appearance
took IC to the final against the
favourites Strathclyde.
The pre-match talk from Dave "The
Juggler' Martin inspired the IC team
to new heights and poor Strathclyde
didn't stand a chance. Aggressive
marking and defending from
'Chopper' Dark and two goals from
Mary Pryor and one from Jim Wilson
gave us a well deserved victory.
From a girlie rower
I'm sure you can imagine
It's as plain as it could be
A usual Saturday rowing
The place ICBC
Another race to row today
The crews are all afloat
Except that is, the girlies,
Well—they havn't got a boat!
After week's of practice
The women stand and moan,
The reason for our boatless
plight—
We're not all 18 stone!
Se we have no option,
To enable us to row,
We have to leave Imperial,
And off to 'King's' we go!
There is yet another round of league
games with a decent selection of
matches for the discerning fan. A l l
matches on Saturday 5th March, kick
off 3pm unless otherwise stated.
QPR vs Liverpool
Loftus Road (White City tube)
Those undefeated lads from the North
venture once more into the capital, I
presume that they won't lose to Derby
in mid-week, eager to equal Leeds'
record of 29 league games without
defeat at the start of a season. QPR
beat Wimbledon last week in what
was described as 'one hell of a boring
game' and that man Gavin Maguire
made a tackle that was so late that the
game was over before he got there.
Liverpool beat Portsmouth last week
with a performance where they were
on par with the southerners but came
away with all the points. Barnes
scored both goals, making him a real
certainty to be made the player of the
year. Who can bet against Liverpool,
but I think that this will be a draw.
West Ham Utd vs Oxford Utd
Boleyn Ground (Upton Park tube)
This a game between two sides in the
middle to base of the league. West
Ham had a disastrous weekend last
week with a defeat at Derby, a one
hour home-truths talk by Manager
John Lyall, a bad injury to Liam
Brady and constant talk about Tony
Cottee's transfer. Problems indeed
that must be helped by buying a new
striker!! Oxford lie in the bottom
three and unless they buck up their
ideas, I can't really see them staying
up. Dean Saunders is proving to be
a smart man up front, but you would
think that Mr '£700M' Maxwell could
buy them some good players. If West
Ham put their act in gear then they
should win.
Wimbledon vs Luton Town
Plough Lane (Wimbledon Park tube)
This game pits together two teams in
the right half of the division this time
with a top six place to play for.
The crowd should be dismal with
neither side having what could be said
to be decent support (9,000 only at
Wimbledon's away game at QPR last
week). The Dons are concentrating
mainly on the Cup this year, but they
must keep their league form together
after a defeat last week. Luton have
recent England man Mick Harford in
their side and with the Stein brothers
having good seasons, Luton are a
strong side. Wimbledon should come
out on top but a draw is possible.
Arsenal vs Tottenham H
Highbury (Arsenal tube)
This is the live game on TV on
Sunday. It will make a change to have
these two sides on TV. I mean, we
haven't had Liverpool, Everton, Man
Utd, Arsenal or Spurs at all on TV
this year... The annual North London
derby with pride, points and positions
all to play for. Arsenal are at
Wembley in the Littlwoods Cup, and
coupled with a 4-0 win against
Charlton last week, things are going
very well for them recently. Spurs
won 3-0 away at Sheffield Wednesday
last week, but Venebles hasn't had
that much to cheer about this year
(except perhaps a big pay off from
Barcelona and a nice little earner from
White Heart Lane. I have had good
luck with my predictions of Arsenal
wins this year and I think that this will
be another.
Crystal Palace vs Oldham
Selhurst Park (Norwood Jet BR)
Palace let me down badly last week.
A home defeat by struggling
Shrewsbury (admittedly on a good
run) is not the sort of form to expect
from a promotion seeking side. •
Oldham are famous as being the
'nearly' side after their unlucky play-
off defeat at the hand of Leeds last
year. Joe Royle is a good manager
and they will bounce back. I think that
their best player is Scot keeper Andy
Goram. Crystal Palace should win,
but they don't like me so I will predict
an away win and wait for a T on the
pools coupon.
Fulham vs Wigan
Craven Cottage (Putney Brdg tube)
That old riverside ground stages a
third division game. Wigan have only
been in the league for ten years but
already have a FA Cup quarter-final
place and a fourth in division three
placing to their name. They have
seven players on their books who
were born on Merseyside, I suppose
that playing for a side like Wigan is
a good way of getting into the
Liverpool first team; because you
have no chance of breaking through
the ranks (sorry to Gary Ablett). A
draw to be expected.
