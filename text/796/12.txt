MANIFESTOS
FELIX EDITOR Bill Goodwin, proposed by Dave Burns
If I didn't think Bill was the best person for the
post of Felix editor, I wouldn't propose him. So,
why should you vote for him? Simple; Bill has
worked on Felix since his first year, being involved
as news editor and in writing features. He was also
the editor of the best C & G handbook 'Spanner'
ever to see the light of day and has had articles
published in the New Scientist. In addition he has
been a regular contributor to Guildsheet and Mines
newsletter.
Being a successful editor is not just a matter of
technical production of Felix and the running of
the Print Unit, it depends heavily on the editor's
personality. Bill gets on well with people and would
make everyone welcome in the office. Most
importantly he takes pains to research his material
properly and accurately.
Dave Burns.
News
I will establish a news and photographic team to
cover college, club, sporting and CCU events in
an accurate and unbiased way. Having spent two
years working on the news side of FELIX, I am
the candidate best able to carry this out.
Features
There will be a regular music page, surveys,
puzzles, in-depth investigations and more clubs
features. I will encourage anyone with strong views
on any subject to write opinion articles.
Event
There will be a "what's on" featuring events in
other London colleges and ULU as well as Imperial.
Humour
Next year's FELIX will contain cartoons, satire and
a humour page directed towards all students, not
just cliques.
Print Unit
I will ensure that priority is given to union work
and FELIX. I would like to see FELIX receiving
more support from advertising.
Bill Goodwin.
FELIX EDITOR Chris Martin, proposed by Liz Holford
A FELIX Editor has to manage as well as be
creative. After seeing Chris running IC Radio, ICU
Publications Board and working for two years on
FELIX, I am sure he is the best candidate for
FELIX Editor. I urge you to vote for him.
Liz Holford, Phoenix Editor.
Every year, candidates tell you what is going to
be different about their FELIX: better news, more
humour etc etc—and yet little changes. Why?
Simply because the Editor finds that they cannot
get together with a few friends and produce the
FELIX they promised. They may not have the
experience or skills needed, and can't (or won't)
encourage others to help.
A good FELIX Editor needs experience in two
key areas:
Firstly, as an organiser; someone who can
encourage students to become involved, and then
keep them interested. The ideal FELIX Editor
writes nothing in the paper, they just make it
possible for every student to make their own
contribution. I am the only candidate to have this
kind of experience; I did it when I was in charge
of IC Radio and I know how to motivate and keep
interest high.
Secondly, as an expert; someone who knows how
all the equipment works, knows all the
techniques—everything from writing to design,
from paste-up to printing, and who is willing to
share this expertise. Again I am the only candidate
with any experience of how the Print Unit works
and, surprisingly, the only candidate to do regular
production work on FELIX.
With a large enthusiastic staff, the old problems
disappear: FELIX won't be cliquey and boring,
simply because of the number of contributors.
FELIX will no longer pursue vendettas, but become
the voice of the students!
Open FELIX up to the students next year.. .vote

FELIX EDITOR Martyn Peck, proposed by Sumeet Ghaie
Martyn is a candidate that many would love to
ignore. His infuriatingly optimistic attitude tends
to get up everyone's left nostril. Yet in only five
months he has "hack"ed his way into IC Radio
(Treasurer), Felix (Advertising Manager), Rag
(Publicity Officer), Rock Soc (Chairman) and
Bean's Club (General Dogsbody). He will also be
editing next year's Alternative Prospectus.
Martyn is obviously capable of giving this post
the dedication it deserves.

A ***** of things to ****,
Some people think I'm a ****, but that's an ***

because when it ***** down to it, I've got a ****

I've made a few ***** in the past, but I'm willing
to make a clean ***** of it to silence my ********.
On the ****, all my ****** around is ****** me.
I has been said that there is too much ***** in
FELIX; this must be ****** in the ***, before
people get in a **** about it, and that would mean
Sorry, that last *** was a bit of a ********. They
keep *****ing up, which is a bit of a ****. I'm
** *** ** ** now after having the ****, back in
the ****** of things, with my usual ****** and
