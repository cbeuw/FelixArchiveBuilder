MUSIC-
Jazz & Rock Club Hop
If you weren't in the Union Lounge
last Saturday night, you missed eight
College bands playing live. For
several bands, the hop was their first
gig ever, in fact some had yet to think
of a name for themselves! Curmudgen
started off with a cover of She Sells
Sanctuary, a song which really needs
a shouting lead singer. Unfortunately,
they were unable to oblige, however,
the rest of their set was quite well
done. I must confess to being
impressed by USSA (formerly Dark
Star). It wasn't the fact that they had
two guitarists, or even the songs they
played, but the stage presence and
'front-man' image projected by the
vocalist, Steve Easterbrook. After
starting with an instrumental, (2112),
a vocalist who didn't play any
instruments and knew what to do on
stage was quite a surprise. They even
managed to work 'Brazilian Rain
Forests' into the lyrics (see last
week's FELIX). After that came
Chances, the only group to use a
drum machine and to have a female
vocalist, who accompanied James
Papa. After starting with an Erasure
cover version, the group managed to
keep many people dancing, even
during their slow song. Schrddinger's
Cat had aquired a new guitarist since
I last saw them, who pissed off all the
other guitarists by out-playing them.
Using the stage piano was a good
idea, as it blended nicely with the rest
of the band. I was disappointed with
what they've done to my favourite of
theirs, War Ain't a Game, turning it
from quite a powerful song into two
alternating chords with a far too
mellow sound to match the 'mud and
slime of France' lyrics. Contact Point
also had a vocalist who didn't play
any instruments, and although
sounding a bit like Rick Astley
(sorry), he used his voice to great
effect in singing what I presume were
original songs, of a very high
standard. Definitely not your average
thrash stuff. Amongst the large
keyboard stack was a Moog Prodigy,
which enabled them to arpeggiate
amazingly fast sequences of notes in
a way that has sadly gone out of
fashion, save perhaps on
Incommunicado. They were the only
band to get an encore, which was
good seeing as their first number was
beset by technical difficulties. It was
definitely worth a second hearing.
The Mock Ducks' lead singer knew
how to twizzle a mike stand, but not
how to keep the audience interested.
The Last Emperor (Cert 15)
Bernardo Bertulucci's The Last
Emperor is a triumph in cinematic art.
This beautifully crafted work tells the
true story of the last emperor of
China. With a visual splendour and
epic feel of a glitzy Gandhi. An epic
in every sense of the word, it boasts
a cast of thousands, exotic locations
and colourful period costumes. This
absorbing drama takes us on an
historical journey through twentieth
century China and although around
2% hours long, it never seems to
drag.
The title of the film refers to Pu Yi,
who ascended to the Imperial throne
of China in 1908 at the age of three.
Three years later China became a
republic and Pu Yi was made a
prisoner within the walls of his own
palace, the Forbidden City.
The film opens with Pu Y i as
prisoner of Communist China in
1950. His life story unfolds in a series
of flashbacks and it is in the early
scenes that the real star of the film
emerges—the Forbidden City. This
glamorous location must be a film
lews
director's dream, and Bertolucci
revels in it. Its colour and beauty are
an awesome backdrop to the lavish
costumes and childhood antics of the
emperor. The bland uniforms of the
communist era serve as powerful
contrast when switching back and
forth between adult and adolescent
stages of life.
The film is truly a feast for the eyes,
but the performances must not be
overlooked. John Lone is very good
as the adult Pu Yi, showing naivety
and immaturity in his character. Peter
O'Toole gives a memorable
performance playing the Emperor's
eccentric Scottish tutor, maintaining
an arrogant yet sympathetic view
towards the imprisoned Emperor.
Pu Y i was a man who was
imprisoned, in one form or another
for most of his life, on account of his
birthright. Bertolucci said of him, he
was 'an Oriental Peter Pan floating
like a cork on the stream of history',
which seems to sum it up. It is only
in his final years as a gardener that
he can taste true freedom and grow
up.
The script acts as a narrative rather
than an analysis on character, and
quite rightly so. We come away with
a history lesson on twentieth century
China, as well as a deeper insight into
the culture and changing face of an
intriguing country. But it is the
outstanding imagery and camerawork
that lingers most in the mind,
although I also came away with the
question, how can a caged cricket
have survived for over 50 years?
You'll know what I mean when you
see the film.
Sumit Guha
They were not on stage for long.
Finally, The Gents delivered a loud
set of sixties cover versions which
made up in liveliness what they lacked
in originality. Everyone loved them.
I managed to get recordings of all
eight bands, which will no doubt find
their way onto IC Radio between 7
and 8 on Tuesdays. If any of the bands
want a copy, come down to the
station. I'd especially like to trade a
live recording for a studio session
recording. We can always use our
Northside studios for recording
bands.

The Larks & Young Blood
Dingwalls, Fri 26th Feb
Support act Young Blood have got a
lot to learn before they start pulling
a regular crowd. After the second
song, I watched the rest of the set
from the bar. Their songs are slightly
reminiscent of the early Jam but
without that special chemistry of the
Jam. Keep at it Young Blood, you can
only get better.
The Larks on the other hand are a
pleasure to review. From the moment
they stepped on stage—WHAM! The
power, energy and vitality overwhelm
you as they and the audience get
wilder and wilder, with non-stop
dancing all through their show. Each
song shows an original sound from
fuzz guitar, to a tight rythmn section,
pulsating with the punchy sounds of
an exciting brass ensemble. They
make it look so easy and they make
it sound like there's a whole orchestra
on stage (in fact there are only six of
them).
Their music is out on its own
compared to the current trend of
grebos, goths, psychadelics, hip-hop,
etc, which probably means that they
might have a harder time trying to get
somewhere. When they do, however
they are likely to be around a lot
longer.
Associations with the group
Madness immediately spring to mind,
but are unfair and superficial as The
Larks show a fresher appealing
sound, with more texture and
coolness to their music.
Why the floor boards of the Union
Hall haven't creaked to the sound of
this band remains somewhat a puzzle,
but judging by the packed, happy,
dancing crowd of students at
Dingwalls I'm sure they'd have no
problem filling it.
