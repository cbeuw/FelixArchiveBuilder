Creationism:
science or
superstition?
Just over a week ago (Thursday 25th
February) a creationist gave a talk at
Imperial College. Creationists reject
the theory of evolution and many also
reject the idea that the earth is billions
of years old. Usually the scientific
establishment rejects such ideas
outright by abusing them as anti-
science and refusing them a hearing.
Such an attitude is wrong.
Creationists are convinced that
there is a conspiracy to prevent them
airing their views in public. They are
indignant about this, because they are
also convinced that their views can be
defended scientifically. Any response
that refuses them a forum for debate
only confirms their suspicions.
I will come back to a few of the
details of their ideas later, but first it
is worth examining their conspiracy
theory. The creationist movement is
big in the American Bible Belt. But,
rather than countering its popularity
in open debate, the scientific
establishment there has tried to
suppress it. Over here, mainstream
biologists and geologists tend to
prefer the path of ignoring creationists
in the hope they will go away. This
is not so much conspiracy as
complacency.
On the other hand, scientists can be
notoriously bigoted in defending
established views. The most clear-cut
case of this concerns the way
Immanuel Velikovsky was treated
when he wanted to publish his
eccentric views on Earth history and
various catastrophes therein (he was
not actually a creationist, just a run
of the mill weirdo). Instead of
allowing him to publish his ideas and
then subjecting them to critical
appraisal, the establishment
suppressed them (publishers pulled
out of deals at the last minute, and so
on). The ideas gained considerable
appeal just because they had been
suppressed: nothing convinces a
believer more than an apparent
conspiracy against his ideas. The
same applies to the creationist
movement: the more they are
ignored, the more the supporters
become convinced of their own
Tightness.
Both complacency and
establishment bigotry do immense
damage to the cause of science. The
best way to deal with silly ideas is to
hold them up for critical examination.
Creationists and the like should be
allowed to publish their views (if they
can express them scientifically) and
those who disagree can then point out,
quietly, rationally and without
emotion, where they went wrong.
Other people can then make up their
own minds on the basis of the
evidence. One of the reasons for the
success of creationism is that its
adherents are not exposed to calm and
rational rebuttals of their beliefs.
Giving them a platform to express
their view in the context of open
debate is one way to get those
supporters out of the ghetto.
In science the establishment is often
wrong, and attempts to keep out
contrary opinions can often result in
important new ideas being wasteftilly
ignored. Branches of science advance
quickest when they are open to new
ideas: lots of silly new ideas will get
published, but the process of criticism
then provokes new insights that
advance the whole field.
Creationists are very good at
spotting anomalies in theories they
don't like. For example, Evolution
suggests that all life evolved from a
common ancestor, but the fossil
record stubbornly refuses to yield
important transitional forms. Even the
classic demonstrations of continuous
evolution (such as the evolution of the
modern horse) are open to severe
criticism. However, there is little
point in defending over-simplistic
presentations of the evidence for
evolution. A lot of the text-book case
studies are rubbish and are used more
for their persuasive power than their
accuracy. It may well be that we
should never have expected any
degree of completeness in the fossil
record, but popular books are
unwilling to admit this and often tend
to iron over the gaps and make the
record look better than it is.
Creationists have been quick to point
out such dubious practices. We should
not be too embarrassed when these
straw men are knocked down: they
only get in the way of good science.
Good scientists should be capable
of making up their own minds on the
basis of actual evidence. An attitude
of constructive criticism of the
conventional wisdom should be
encouraged, otherwise their branch of
science will fossilize. Listening to
what the creationists say can be a
helpful part of this process: they are
capable of spotting an anomaly in
conventional science a mile off.
Trying to face their criticisms (rather
than just ignoring them) would do
some areas of science a lot of good,
and would create the sort of critical
but constructive minds that all areas
of science need.
Where creationists go seriously
wrong is in their attempt to build an
alternative theory of earth history on
the basis of the holes in the
conventional one. No theory is
perfect. Indeed, it is the holes that
keep science in business. Serious
doubt is only worthwhile when a lot
of big holes stubbornly resist being
filled in. Evolution has been
extremely successful at filling in the
big holes in the history of life, but
there are still a lot of smaller holes
waiting to be looked at. We should
not be frightened of looking at them
ourselves, nor should we exclude
those who point them out.
The major argument for refusing to
debate with creationists (their beliefs
are religious and hence beyond the
realm of science) is actually a bit of
a red herring. Many establishment
scientists have pretty funny religious
views, but we don't exclude them
from mainstream science. Anyway,
many scientists get far too 'religious'
about their science. They act as
though science could solve the
world's problems (as though the
world is in a mess just because people
refuse to think rationally about it).
They defend their beliefs in a wholly
irrational manner. They refuse to
consider alternative theories and do
their best to exclude awkward facts.
These are all signs of the sort of
religious insecurity creationists are
supposed to be guilty of. But they are
typical human traits, and appear
whenever anyone gets too committed
to any set of beliefs, religious or not.
We all prefer to see just what we
want to see. Beating this urge is an
important part of being a good
scientist.
