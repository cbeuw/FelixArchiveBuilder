FELIX
It's very hard to describe YARGO
almost all the people I asked said they
have a strange but exciting new
sound, nearly jazzy but not quite,
nearly funky but not quite. Anyway
the best thing to do is come along and
see for yourself, the band have had
more hype than most in the last few
months and are well worth £1.50.
They will be playing in the Lounge
on Friday March 4th and the doors
open at 9pm, the band will be on stage
at 10pm and the disco will go on until
12.30pm. Tickets as usual can be
bought from the Snack Bar for £1 in
advance or on the door at £1.50.
John Noble
WOMEN'S OFFICER
Self-defence et al
Just a few things to tell you about:
There will be a Self-Defence course
next term—it is in the process of being
organised. Any women who are
interested should sign up in the Union
Office.
Also next term, on Tuesday May
10, there will be a video on Cervical
Cancer in the Union Concert Hall at
lunchtime. This is a WIST (Women
in Science and Technology) event and
is open to all women. The video is
fairly short, so it can be shown more
than once if there is enough interest.
There will also be time for discussion
and questions—I have information
sheets from WHIC (Women's Health
Information Centre).
On Tuesday March 8, I will be
joining the Jewish Society in a
sponsored fast to raise money for the
Student and Academic Campaign for
Soviet Jews. Galina Pilmenstein, a 20
year-old refusenik in Moscow, will be
hunger striking on the 8th
(International Women's Day) to draw
attention to the plight of Soviet Jews.
Finally, look out for posters
announcing an IC Ladies Lunch open
to all female students and staff as
well. This should be in the last week
of term—if I get organised in time.
Please don't hesitate to contact me
with any complaints, comments and
suggestions. Anyone who wants to
stand for the post of Women's Officer
next year is more than welcome to
talk to me about it anytime—the
biggest requirement is probably
enthusiasm!

The Palestine situation
The recent events in the occupied
territories of Gaza and the West Bank
have forced me to speak out for these
unfortunate oppressed people.
The scenes being shown on TV of
their protest are all too familiar. They
show the utter desperation and
hopelessness of their situation. Why
else would women and youths, some
not even in their teens, take on the
might of the Israeli Army?
It is a known fact that the living
conditions in these camps are
subhuman. The Palestinians are
treated as second class citizens in their
birthplace. They live in shanty towns
with usually no electricity, water
supplies or waste disposal systems.
To make matters worse they see new
luxurious Israeli settlements springing
up all over the occupied territories
showing that Israel has no intention
of leaving these territories.
It should come as no shock that the
Palestinians protest. It should be
remembered that these protests started
because an Israeli Army truck overran
four Palestinian youths. What is
surprising though is the excessive
amount of force being used in the
Israeli Army in putting down these
protests. It seems that all this world
criticism has had no effect on their
tactics. They were already using live
ammunition and now they have
resorted to dumdum bullets,
indescriminate beatings and the use of
a special tear gas which causes
abortion to install fear into the
Palestinian people. Not to mention
cases such as the burying alive of
three Palestinians with a bulldozer
and the pounding with rocks of certain
protesters by soldiers. As if that
weren't enough even Israeli civilians
who are freely allowed to carry
firearms join in the shooting down of
these protesters. So far 72
Palestinians have died and hundreds
have been seriously injured in this
uprising.
The Israeli Knesset says it has no
choice. It wants to solve the problem
but first these protests must be put
down. What was preventing them
from solving the problems in the last
30 years? They say they don't know
who to talk to. When the PLO is
mentioned they say it is just a terrorist
organisation. They forget that they
themselves were regarded as terrorists
not too long ago. It seems that they
want to avoid the issue. They even say
that the soldiers only shoot when their
life is in danger and that they don't
use force unless it is necessary but the
TV pictures show the contrary.
The Israeli Knesset is supposed to
be the representative of the Israeli
people, people who have suffered
great atrocities during the Second
World War. They of all people should
understand the sufferings of the
Palestinian people.
I couldn't but help notice that in
FELIX (26.2.88) the Jewish Soc has
asked for support on humanitarian
grounds for Alex Paberezchensky
who has been asked to join the
Russian military which will cause the
Russians to refuse him an exit visa for
20.years. They on the other hand were
very active in opposing the motion put
out on the same humanitarian grounds
for condemning by the Union the
heavy-handedness of the Israeli Army
in putting down these protests.
Undoubtedly the Palestinians are
suffering under the present situation
but it is not only a Palestinian
problem. It is a problem for all
humanitarian and conscience bearing
people to solve.
