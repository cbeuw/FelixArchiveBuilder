SKI CLUB
The Ski Team were once again
gorgeous and wonderful on Saturday
27th. Miracles are not a very common
thing, nevertheless there was one on
the dangerous, spikey slopes of
Hemel Hempstead as Imperial came
second in the North London racing
league. Thereby reaching the National
Finals!!
The Team was doing wonderfully;
beating instructors, national class
racers, not so national class skiers and
beginners.
We reached the finals (again!) only
to be beaten by a hair's breadth
(again!) by University College
(again!!).
We confirmed our position in the
National Finals by coming second in
the North London League.

Imperial College ARS is now back on
the HF bands following the
installation of a new multi-band
vertical antenna on top of the Union
Building roof. This antenna seems to
be working well—and has certainly
reduced the interference problems that
STOIC were experiencing from the
old and inefficient dipole that was
'slung' across the roof. The rotator
due to drive the 2m beam antenna
(which will be atop Elec Eng) has also
been repaired, and installation of this
antennna will be the next society
'task'.
Congratulations go to the following
Hamsoc members who gained DTI
amateur transmission licenses in the
December examinations.

Last week Tim Janman, Conservative
MP for Thurrock, came to College to
speak about current issues in the
education system.
Under the comprehensive system
he claimed competition between
children was being discouraged, and
there has been a major decline in
teaching standards, discipline and
course content. He wished to see a
return to the grammar school system
which enabled bright children in poor
neighbourhoods a means of escape.
Currently, he said, parents had no
choice unless they were willing to
pay. Opting out would change all this.
More topically he intends to put in
an amendment to the education
reform bill whereby it would be
illegal for a student's union to affiliate
on block to the NUS. He claimed
public money was going to the NUS
for functions other than commercial
services for students. It was not right
for a few hundred people to decide for
everyone how to spend the taxpayers
money.
He used Glasgow University as an
example of a union which de-affiliated
and only 8 students wished to join the
NUS after the withdrawal.

With the upcoming debate on the
death penalty in Parliament, you may
wish to write to your MP.
In addition to the death penalty
being a cruel and inhuman
punishment, there is no evidence to
suggest that it is effective as a
deterrent. Studies have concluded that
the majority of murders take place
among members of the same family
or friends and are crimes of passion
without premeditation. The assailant
gave no thought to the consequences.
In connection with terrorists it is
thought that the death sentence would
only serve to create martyrs.
Help us oppose the re-introduction
of the death penalty.
Thunderbirds
are go!
Anyone interested in forming a
society to recognise the artistic genius
of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, as
demonstrated in shows such as
Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet,
Fireball XL5, Stingray and Joe 90,
please contact Adrian Bourne
(Physics 2) with any suggestions.
IC RADIO
First 10 years
IC Radio has been broadcasting
regular daily programmes now for
over 10 years. Starting, by line only,
in January 1978 and then on medium
wave from December of the same
year, there's been all sorts of
programmes both good and bad.
Over the 10 years a great many
presenters have come and gone, and
indeed some of them can now be
heard on professional radio. This
Saturday, from 11am until 6pm, an
assortment of DJs from the past are
going to be presenting all of the
programmes on the station. With the
recent studio equipment changes it
will be interesting to see how they
cope, and whether they have kept up-
to-date with the music. There'll
probably be some reminiscing too.
Keeping them in order, and
attempting to explain what's going on,
will be the present Station Manager,
Steven Gutteridge.
The programmes should be well
worth hearing, and if you want to
meet an (ex) IC Radio megastar or
two, call into the Southside studio
during the day, autographs are free...
ICSF
Who?
Sat 5th March, lOam-lOpm
Union Building, £3 ICSF, £4 others
Following, it has been said, in the
wark of the hugely enjoyable
PICOCON 6, ICSF attempt to outdo
themselves, and everybody else, with
the frabjous Who? Day 3, (aka
ChaosCon), bringing you glottish
quantities of classic teleSF, centred
around Dr Who but including the best
of the past 20 years. Survivors,
Doomwatch (very good), Tomorrow
People, UFO, 1999 and even Star
Cops. The Dr Who will be both
continuous and simultaneous with the
above, including Masque of
Mendragora, Shoda and Dalek
Invasion of Earth.
But the last programme is the
best—the guests! The guest list
includes Colin Baker, Nick Courtney,
Debbie Wating and Gerry Davis and
of course many many more.
Furthermorefully, Sylvester McCoy,
Terry Jones and the Star Cops cast
have been invited.
In addition, we will have some cool
and groovy Dr Who hardware; 2
Daleks, Ore Davros and bits of
cybermen, some of which will be
appearing at the charity auction—in
aid of CotDeath and IC Rag—later in
the day. If you've even the tiniest
desire for a bit of Who? memorabilia,
pick it up on Saturday.
If you have any vestigial interest in
teleSF of any form, you could do a
lot worse than coming to Who? Day
3. Hope to see you there!

Heston services on the M4 provided
the venue for this year's annual City
& Guilds Motor Club autotest.
Despite the killing off of his amazing
Mini on a rally last term Clive
Hudson, last year's champion, won
in a Nissan Micra. This must have
been THE car to have the top three
finishers all sharing the same car only
20 seconds or the equivalent of hitting
two cones separating the three. Tim

their general skill. Captain Stout gave
a fine performance borrowing Mark
Putt's Mini, Mark is now looking for
some new tyres after the two of them
went mad in his car. Lee Stanley was
very entertaining, lifting wheels off
the ground throughout the day,
unfortunately he was over enthusiastic
on his last run, both inside wheels
came off the ground and the Honda
rolled over on to its side, the strong
wind on the day helping with the
capsize. Dave 'handbrake' Hobbs
despite organising the autotest and his
reputation for the use of the
handbrake came a disappointing 18th.
Lesley Wilson picked up the Ladies
award, 22nd overall driving an
Escort.
