Have you ever
noticed that when a
person enters the
company of a
member of the
opposite sex,
certain changes take
place in the
appearance of both
people? Men no
longer slouch but
pull their stomachs
in, their chests
protrude and their
eyes begin to
sparkle. Women
assume an erect
posture and push
their breasts out.
Both people lose
the bagging around
their faces and to
the casual observer,
they both become
more youthful in
appearance.
While these movements are studied
and deliberate, others are completely
unconsciously done. Again these
movements indicate that man is just
another animal. Just like a male bird,
a man can preen and make sexually
aggressive signals while the female
looks on, apparently uninterested in
the whole display. Research into
animal courtship behaviour has shown
that male and female animals use a
series of intricate courtship gestures.
The success that people have in sexual
encounters is directly related to their
ability to send these courtship signals
and recognise those that are being sent
back. As with most body signals,
women are far better at picking up
and giving out these messages. Men,
however, are often totally blind to
them. Because of this factor, women
have a greater range of courtship
gestures than men.
Men
Most men tend to start 'preening'
themselves when a woman
approaches. A man will sit up and
throw his shoulders back, while
reaching for his throat and
straightening his tie, or brushing
imaginary particles off his trousers
and sleeves. He may also smooth his
hair. Men are not very good at
appearing 'sexy'. The most sexually
aggressive display a man can make is
the thumbs-in-the-top-of-pockets
gesture, which we mentioned last
week, in order to highlight his genital
region. Alternatively, if he is seated,
he may spread his legs to give a crotch
display.
If he is really going for it, he will
use his eyes to get the message across.
He can use an intimate gaze for just
a split second longer than is normal
and moisten his lips. Should he be
aroused, his pupils will dilate, which
should be a clear message to the
female that he is ready for action.
Women
Women will also use preening
gestures to attract a man. Inese
include playing with their hair,
smoothing clothing, using the
extended intimate gaze and increasing
eye contact. As well as pupil dilation,
they will also gain a flushed
appearance to the cheeks, indicating
wild sexual desire.
Hair is very important in female
courtship gestures. This is why many
women who are interested will toss
their hair away from the face by a
flick of the head. Even women with
very short hair use this head flick
motion. The woman's wrist area is a
highly erotic area of her body which
is why women wear bracelets to
accentuate the region. An interested
female will gradually expose her
wrists as she is talking to the male.
This also explains why so many
women like to smoke in party
situations: smoking makes this
tantalising wrist exposure very easy
to perform. These wrist and head flick
gestures are also used by homosexual
males who want to take on a feminine
appearance. This is why many women
can tell if a man is gay just by
spending a few minutes with him.
Research has shown that sexually
aggressive women will open their legs
wider when a man enters the room.
This will happen whether the woman
is sitting or standing. However, the
sexually defensive woman will
usually cross her legs or keep them
together at all times.
Some of the more subtle of
courtship gestures have been used to
sell goods for centuries. Take a look
at all the advertising in Sunday
magazines and in the tube stations
which contains women with wet lips,
making sideways glances and pouting
gestures. With partially dropped
eyelids, the model holds a fixed gaze
and parts her lips, inviting the man
to buy whatever she may be holding.
Dr Desmond Morris described the
mouth slightly open, wet-lipped look
as a self mimicry as it is intended to
symbolise the female genital region.
Women can either wet their lips
naturally or use glossy cosmetics to
create a more long-lasting effect.
Whichever method is used, they are
intended to give the woman the
appearance of sexual invitation.
When a woman is sexually aroused
her lips grow larger and redden as
they fill with blood. This is the idea
behind the use of lipstick.
There are many ways to spot if a
woman is aroused. As well as those
we have already mentioned, a fondled
9B
cigarette, the stem of a wine glass or
a finger, is an unconscious indication
of what may be in the mind. Other
signals include crossing and
uncrossing the legs slowly in front of
the man and gently stroking the thighs
with her hand, indicating a desire to
be touched.
So next time you play the casual
observer at a party, watch for the
signals that are unconsciously thrown
across the room. Even better, use
what you have learnt to better predict
your chances when you meet someone
you fancy.
