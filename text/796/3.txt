What a lot of
shish, innit
peeps!
College Refectories Manager Rob
Northey has revealed exclusively to
FELIX that he is building a kebab
house in Southside. He scotched
rumours that he was also planning to
serve curry because he believes that
such a venture would only attract
drunkards on Friday and Saturday
nights. He said that his new kebab
venture was forced on him due to
pressures being put on his highly
successful pizza bar and QT burger
joint. The kebab house will be placed
in the room above the Southside Bar
adjacent to the Upper Lounge. It will
be open during the usual bar hours
and will be better value than local
kebab house, Mr Northey promises.
Southside residents, meanwhile, are
suffering from noise and dust as the
workmen work up to eight o'clock in
1
the evening.
Mr Northey has promised the new
service for the summer term.
You'll never have it so good...

St Mary's Students' Union is taking

Competition
If you're aged between 16 and 28 and
fancy a week in the USA, then the
Daily Telegraph's Young Science
Writer competition could be your
chance.
Entrants are invited to write up to
1,000 words on any exciting scientific
discovery or original topic of
research. There are two categories;
one for the 16-21 age group and the
other for the 22-28 age group. Entries
will be judged by a panel, including
science correspondents and whacky
'German' Professor Heinz Wolff.

Lab stocktake
The Advisory Board for the Research
Councils has begun its national
stocktake of research equipment in
British universities. It has sponsored
a survey, to be carried out by a group
from Manchester University, which
will note all laboratory equipment in
science and engineering departments.
The survey will assess the age, state
of repair, cost and adequacy of the
tools used. Questionnaires will be sent
to all heads of departments asking
them about needs and priorities for
equipment. Other forms will be sent
to individual operators who have
equipment worth more than £10,000.
Physics hit
The Science and Engineering
Research Council (SERC) has
decided to reduce its grants to
astronomy and high energy physics
research next year.
Grants
Students on approved international
degree programmes will qualify
automatically for grants next
academic year. All degress run in
conjunction with overseas institutions
will qualify as long as they are
validated by a university or the
Council for National Academic
Awards.
Awards
The Government is planning to bring
degree and postgraduate professional
awards to a national framework
underneath the new National Council
for Vocational Qualifications.
Slammed!
The rector of Kuwait University has
slammed his students as being lazy
and work-shy and has blamed them
for the University's bad academic
record. Ahmed Bishara, the vice-
rector, said that his students had few
real interests and lacked creativity and
initiative. He said 'Most students have
an ambition merely to pass an
examination and are prepared to use
their potential only if a tangible
reward is in sight'.
