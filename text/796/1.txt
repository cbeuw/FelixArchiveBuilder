The Christian Union (CU) is to be thrown out of Imperial College
Union next year if a decision taken at a recent Union Finance
Committee is upheld by ICU Council next Monday. The committee
'refused to fund' the CU, as it felt their constitution contravened the
ICU by-laws, the rules that Union is run by.
The by-law in question is one that declaration to this effect before they
says that TCU facilities must be open
to all its members', and this has been
interpreted to mean that any student
may join any club or society. The CU
constitution states that members must
hold certain beliefs and sign a
are able to join.
The C U claim that they need this
restriction on membership to be a
member of the Universities and
Colleges Christian Fellowship
(UCCF), the national body which
Steph Snell beat Dave Smedley and Daniel Shiu to become RCSU President
with a majority of 30 votes. Gail Turner took the position of Honorary
Secretary with a convincing 114 vote majority over Julian Moore and Steve
Mitchell. The position of Honorary Junior Treasurer was won with a margin
of 100 votes by Carol Luscombe over fellow first year physicist Sarah Porter
and Vijay Thakur. Dave Williams, and Andrew Meredith were
returned unopposed as VP and AAO respectively.
gives them substantial support.
The matter is due to be brought up
at Union Council on Monday, which
will make the final decision on the
status of the CU. If the CU is thrown
out it will be unable to book rooms,
have any funding from ICU and have
adverts in FELIX. They may still be
able to book rooms in the College
through their contacts within the
departments. C U are due to discuss
the matter at a committee meeting
next week and also at a forthcoming
Extraordinary General Meeting.
Union President Sydney Harbour-
Bridge (formerly Ian Howgate) said
that if the CU were to get away with
this, it would be carte blanche for all
the tie clubs, with self-elected
membership, to become part of ICU.
Jackie Scott, Secretary of CU, told
FELIX that, as far as she was
concerned, CU would 'fight this all
the way', possibly even to a Union
General Meeting. She feels that
exceptions should be made to the rules
for religious societies and it is
reasonable to expect at least
committee members to hold the belief
the society is promoting.
