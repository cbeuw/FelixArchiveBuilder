It's the time of year when punters start
rubbing their hands in anticipation for
the racing feast ahead. With the
Cheltenham Festival, the National,
and the 1000 and 2000 Guineas
coming up, it's now that trainers start
testing the field with a few
preliminary races before the classics
start looming. Last weekend was no
exception.
There was more funny business
from David Elseworth's stable when
Rhyme n' Reason won the Racing
Post Handicap Chase. He left top
weight Desert Orchid in at the
overnight stage and declared him as
a non-runner in the morning. This left
Rhyme n' Reason only carrying lOst
1 lib instead of a stone heavier had
Desert Orchid run. Putting this down
to an administrative cock-up,
Elseworth's reaction was that his
horse would have won anyway. He
now has an appointment with the
Jockey Club this week to explain his
actions. This should prove interesting
as he is already in deep water over
still unresolved doping allegations
surrounding Cavvies Clown. His
chance of getting off with no more
than a slap on the wrist? I'll lay 2-1
the field. Rhyme n' Reason is now
16-1 for the National and the same
price for Cheltenham. He's quoted at
200-1 for the double.
With an excellent St Patrick's Day
meeting at Leopardstown promised to
rival the Gold Cup, Carvils Hill looks
to be the horse to beat. Rated as the
best prospect Ireland has produced
since sadly-missed Dawn Run, trainer
Jim Dreaper has plans for his horse
with Leopardstown/Fairyhouse/
British treble.
Looking to this Saturday, Midnight
Count, who has not raced for some
14 months due to injury, is now set
to make his comeback. Josh Gifford
has declared him for the Timeform
Chase at Haydock.
Romford dogs on Saturday sees the
opening three heats of the Sporting
Life Marathon. This is one of the
major events in the greyhound year.
The final is next Wednesday with an
excellent programme lined up
including the Sporting Life Maxi
Marathon, a 1100m race—the longest
allowed under National Greyhound
Racing Club rules.
This week's winners appear in the
news pages.
Runrig
Forget Big Country, forget Simple
Minds and forget those Eddie
Edwards lookalikes the Proclaimers,
the Scottish band are Runrig, playing
their first major London gig tonight
at the Town and Country Club,
Kentish Town.
The six piece band from the west
MUSKL
coast are absolute mega stars in
Scotland and are deservedly on the
edge of breaking through in England.
The mainly Gaelic lyrics on the
early alubums Recovery and
Heartland are being replaced by
English to the extent that the new
album contains only two Gaelic tracks
including the brilliantly rousing Alba
(meaning 'Scotland'). Protect and
Survive, which is normally dedicated
to 'all those who think that nuclear
war is remotely acceptable', is a
meditation on life, and the sheer
futility of war.
The highland melodies and lyrics
denouncing absentee landlords and
what they see as a foreign government
guarantee a rapturous reception at
home. The mainly Scottish audience
will undoubtedly love it, but don't be
put off if, like me, you're a sassanach.
Runrig have something for everyone.
Tickets are £5 and it's probably worth
checking for availability first on 267
3334.

One of the grooviest bands around
will appear at the Astoria tonight and
tomorrow in the shape of All About
Eve. Don't be put off by the single
Wild Hearted Woman which must be
their most drab yet. They play a
blinder live. Support comes from
Something Happens who have
achieved some fame from supporting
The Alarm. This week has its
spattering of the usual indie sounds,
most notably the Milk Monitors at the
Clarendon, Mighty Mighty at the
Tunnel, and finally The Men They
Couldn't Hang at Thames Poly, all
tonight. The Flag in North Wembley
has traditionally been the centre of the
universe for Numanoids, and this will
be the weekend of the year as Gary
Numan himself appears both tonight
and tomorrow. For anyone feeling
rich, Heart are delivering their pop-
metal at Wembley Arena on Saturday,
and on Sunday a band who need no
introduction, the delightful Zodiac
Mindwarp and the Love Reaction, hit
Hammersmith Odeon.
