Jinking good show!
IC II—4
New College II—1
The invincible 2nds march on!
Another game, another two points
added to their impressive total for this
season. Captain Russ Dark won the
toss, and IC kicked off. They didn't
have to wait long before the
inevitable. Alan Galss beat the New
College defence with a jinking, solo
run, slid the ball inside for Pip Peel
to convert the first goal. A second was
soon added by Alan Glass, who's cool
head has enabled him to score so
many this season. After the switch,
New College pulled one back, after
Stuart Miller was blatently pushed off
the ball. Despite this, IC continued to
dominate in a game that, for the
defence, was as interesting as a 1st
team match report! Mickey
Plummer's probing runs, Chris
Burton's shivering due to the cold,
Paul Thompson's mouth and Guy
Phiri's offsides all helped to produced
as many talking points as a night out
with the 4th team! Eventually Pip Peel
got his second and IC's third goal, to
ease any worries about dropping
points. This was rounded off to four
when Alan Glass was on target,
shortly after the final whistle went,
without any mention of 'Billy the
Fish' Allen, or Eddy the Eagle. A
special mention to Rakesh Muthoo,
who was stupid enough to take a cold
shower after the game. After this win,
IC can look forward to a piece of
silverware at the end of the season,
in the shape of the league title.
No Jon, me no speak French
IC V vs LSE IV
LSE turned up very late, and quite
frankly needn't have bothered. With
only eight players, LSE were always
going to struggle, and if it wasn't for
the fact that IC's play was abysmal,
the game could quite easily have
deteriorated to a one-side farce. For
fifteen minutes IC made such a big
deal out of getting past seven
defenders that tempers became frail.
Luckily Lee Roberts kept his head
whilst all those around him were
screaming theirs' off, and confidently
stroked the opener from a tight angle.
Two minutes later, John Bolger
trampled all over an LSE defender,
and Bas.Basma took advantage with
a simple tap-in. 'We should get a
dozen against this lot' commented
Glenn Evans....ten seconds later,
LSE pulled one back. Their centre
half ran through Jon Turner, side-
stepped several tackles, and slipped
the ball past Steve Von Bargen who
was busy inspecting the grass at the
time to notice. Everyone started
swearing at each other. All of it was
unprintable. A few minutes later a
cross from the right eluded everyone
except Lee, who made the volley look
easy. 3-1. Deja-vous two minutes
later, and this time Bas made the tap-
in look difficult, but luckily the
goalkeeper dived out of the way. 4-1.
Half-time, and Rob Kay and Alan
Gelder (two newcomers) gave the rest
of the team a rollicking for playing
so appallingly. 'But we're always this
crap' is the muttered reply. Paul
Cauldwell was replaced by Francis
Shupo, making his debut. More
rubbish from IC led to more shouting,
(except from Bah Tamanji, who's
only comment was 'No, Jon, me no
play sub'), until Bas hit a snap shot
from twenty yards for his hattrick.
5-1. Jon actually entered the
opposition's penalty area for the first
time this season, but whilst the LSE
defence were pooing themselves
about the presence of his hunky
masculine frame, Francis slid in the
corner with a stupendous volley. 6-1.

Victory over old rivals
London Colleges Knockout Cup
Imperial College reached the final of
this even for the second time in three
years by having straight forward wins
against Mary's, St George's and
Guy's Hospital. In the final IC were
faced by their old rivals, UCL.
First blood went to IC in the men's
doubles with a convincing win by
Sean Mulshaw and Simon Hughes
over the UCL second pair. This was
short lived however when the UCL
first pair dominated both their rubbers
to give them an early edge.
In the mixed doubles UCL played
very well against three strong IC
combinations. Sean and Julie
Goodeve to claw their way to win
over three games, 4-15, 18-17, 15-9.
Once more UCL fought back to defeat
Julie, this time playing with Bharat
Popat, again over three tight games
to give them victory in the mixed,
2-1.
In the singles Trevor Kevmick had
Wasps stung
Imperial College 1st XV—14
Wasps 3rd X V - 3
Tries: Quirk, Jenkins and Smith
Ooh no! The Boys have done it again!
After a spirited performance in mid-
week against the Met Police, when IC
struggled through to win by 13-4, the
Rugby Club continued to maintain its
stranglehold on the almost 1st class
rugby scene by beating Wasps 3rd
XV by a goal and two tries to a
penalty (14-3).
Despite having some regular
second team players in their pack,
Wasps were unable to dominate. As
the opposition's initial pressure
subsided, the IC backs showed the
Loose ladies
IC vs Southampton
Last weekend, in very little wind, IC
sailed against Southampton (regarded
as the best university sailing team).
In the morning races, IC still tired
after travelling for over two hours,
were narrowly beaten by the men's
team. After lunch IC sailed against the
ladies team who had a rather loose
interpretation of the rules. Despite
this IC won the first race, and were
leading the second race, until Ape
proved that he is in a different class
to everyone else by sailing a different
course. Final score versus the ladies
an impressive victory. Despite losing
the first end he eventually got his
opponent on the run, and from then
on it was just a matter of playing the
steady, consistent badminton we have
come to expect from him.
In the ladies doubles Julie, playing
with Uta Boltse set the standard with
a 15-16, 15-2 victory. This was
followed by further wins, equally
convincing in nature, by Uta and
Sarah Threadgold, and then Sarah and
Jo Cohen. The last of these made IC
champions by a margin of 7-4
Three Imperial College players
received honours at this year's British
Universities Championships, while
playing for London University. Julie
Goodeve won a silver medal in the
mixed doubles (playing with Paul
Walden of London Vets) and Sean
Mulshaw and Simon Hughes received
bronze medals for reaching the semi-
finals of the men's doubles.

way forward with a simple but
effective move, leaving J Quirk to
drive through a weak defense for a try
by the posts.
After the break Wasps tried to
attack again, but their heads soon
dropped. A 20 yard break from Andy
Watson, followed by a delicate chip
into touch gave IC a lineout near the
Wasp's try line: Greensmith palmed
to Jenkins, on the burst, who drove
over from a full 60 inches. Simon
Smith ended a good game with a
driving try in the corner and an
'almost try' by 'Roboprop' (Peter
Drew) just about wound up a
convincing victory.
SAILING
was one all.
The next set of races were against
the men's team again, this time IC
beat them to make it a tie overall.
For the deciding race the venue was
changed to Southampton Docks. After
an encounter with a frigate, where
Sam lost her bottle (twice!), the pace
really hotted up and Sam and Bill
were unable to finish. At this point
there were signs of a Southampton
win, but Richard stole it from them
to give IC a win before the long trek
home.
