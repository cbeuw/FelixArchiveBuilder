MANIFESTO
Playing by the rules
IC Union is more progressive and up-
to-date than the British Parliament.
This may come as a shock, but as far
as elections are concerned it is quite
true. The reason for this is the use of
the Single Transferable Vote (STV)
system of making and counting ballot
papers. This system is slightly more
complicated than the first past the post
system but is thought by many to be
much fairer. It allows you to express
second or third preferences if you so
wish.
This year's elections
and how to vote
This year there are four elections.
Two of these have two candidates and
two of them have three candidates. In
either case, your first preference will
be marked with a one (1).
Candidate A
Candidate B 1
Candidate X
Candidate Y 1
Candidate Z
If you don't want to express a
preference for any more than one
candidate, that is how to do it. If you
wish to express a second preference,
or second and third preferences, you
are free to do so.
Candidate A 2
Candidate B f
Candidate X I
Candidate Y 3
Candidate Z 2.
You are free to express as many levels
of preference as you wish, but the
numbers you put down must be in
numerical sequence, ie you can't
express first and third preferences
without a second preference.
But what does this all mean?
The main crux of the STV system is
that to win, a candidate has to pass
'quota'. In the first count, 'quota' is
the number of valid ballot papers,
divided by two, plus one, ie for 935
papers, quota will be 469. If a
candidate passes quota on first count,
my job is made much easier as they
are elected. If not, the candidate with
the lowest number of first preferences
will drop out. Any second preferences
indicated on that candidate's first
preference papers will then remain as
valid papers and will be divided
amongst the remaining candidates as
per the second preference expressed.
Any first preference papers for this
candidate which do not contain a
second preference will be discounted
from the second count. This means
that 'quota' will change if this is the
case. The easiest way to explain this
is by a hypothetical example.
First count Second count
Candidate X 402 493 (402+91) win
Candidate Y 327 387 (327+60)
Candidate Z 206
Total
Quota
935
469 441
The final preference is so that in the
case of two remaining candidates
tying, the issue can be decided by the
final count.
Abstentions
If you do not think that any of the
candidates are of sufficient calibre,
you can register an abstention. The
way to do this is to write 'ABSTAIN'
across the ballot paper. This is the
only accepted spelling and any other
spelling will be a spoilt paper. An
abstention is not a wasted vote and is
quite different from simply not
voting. If the number of abstentions
recorded is greater than the total votes
cast, the election must be re-run from
the very start, ie from the stage of
papers up.
Summary
1. Vote in order of preference number
1. 2, 3.
2. Abstain by writing 'ABSTAIN'
across the paper.
3. Do not write anything other than
that explained above.
4. Remember to bring your Union
card.

A letter from the
Returning Officer
Dear Judith,
In view of the offensive nature of
many of the words in Martyn Peck's
Manifesto, I am requesting on behalf
of Elections Committee that such
words be replaced by a line of stars,
eg '*****' as opposed to 'pussy'.
This would enable the manifesto to be
printed substantially unaltered, with
only the offensive nature changed.
Yours sincerely,
Charles Jackson,
ICU Returning Officer.

Re: Bill Goodwin's publicity for
FELIX Editor.
On Bill Goodwin's publicity, it
has been stated that his
proposer Dave Burns is FELIX
Club President.
FELIX Club has no official
relationship with FELIX and is a
private club not a part of IC
Union. Dave Burns is proposing
Bill Goodwin in a completely
personal capacity.
