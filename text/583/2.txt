Dm) Sir
I was somewhat taken aback to
h e a r t h e a l l e g a t i o n s l e v e l l e d
a g a i n s t m e b y M r H a y w a r d
( F E L I X 5 8 2 ) . I h a d . ' u n t i l
reading his letter, absolutely no
k n o w l e d g e whatsoever of the
motion which I a m act used ol
seconding,-lo throw M r Corlazzi
in the R P . Indeed, it surprises me
that the U G M Chairman allowed
such an obviously unconstitu-
tional motion. I can only assume
that someone, w h o o b v i o u s l y
holds me i n considerable con-
t e m p t , s a w f i t to f o r g e m y
s i g n a t u r e to t h i s c h i l d i s h ,
frivolous motion.

I hope i n the f o r t h c o m i n g
issues ol F E L I X you will also tell
us about the Fascist songs they
sang al ibis Conference ( V i e
Statesman, .April 24 1981. p3). By
the way, did Colin Palmer, in bis
bid for "national Tory leader-
ship" also join m singing these
songs while (to use your own
phrase) 'Hying the I C Hag in
typical style"?

College Secretary defends
IC policy on South African
sponsored students on
nuclear technology course
MR JOHN SMITH, CBE, Secretary of Imperial College,
reaffirmed the fundamental principles of the College during a
debate last Tuesday afternoon.
T h e debate centered around a motion "that I C should not assist i n
developing South Africa's nuclear capability by accepting South
Africa-sponsored students on its nuclear technology course".
The debate was opened by M r M i k e Terry, General Secretary of the
Anti-Apartheid Movement. H e outlined the situation regarding South
Africa, how it had made military intervention in many southern
African states, how it had been condemned at the United Nations, and
how it practiced a crude form of racism which divides on the basis of
race a n d language.
For ten years it had been speculated that South Africa was looking
for the ultimate weapon. Events have suggested that South Africa now
has such a weapon and would be prepared to use it. This suggestion is
not just the exaggerated polemics of the Anti-apartheid Movement, as
South Africa is an abnormal society where many people are N a z i
sympathisers.
South Africa has its own uranium mines and has a lair amount of
technology for creating nuclear fuel. However it still needs more
specialists and technology. T o that end it takes advantage of courses
such as the one at IC. South Africa should be denied this opportunity.
I C should reconsider its position as the risk that it is wrong cannot be
afforded.
M r Smith, outlining the College position, said that students were
admitted on grounds of academic merit only. I C only functions as a
corporate body w i t h i n its o w n sphere of competence, academic
matters. Once it went beyond this it would be open to pressure from all
quarters. It should be the British Government's decision if students
were not to be allowed into the country to study.
The College does not inquire too deeply into each student's financial
backing as this would be an invasion of privacy of the individual. T h e
current sponsorship arrangements do have loopholes but I C would be
going back on its basic principles if it started allowing special eases.
Alter many spirited interventions from the audience ol nearly forty
people, M i k e 'Ferry summed up, arguing that I C should be ahead of
other colleges in this matter.
T h e motion was passed by a large majority.
Fewer overseas students
in Britain
A P P L I C A T I O N S F R O M overseas students for British University-
places are thirty-live percent down compared to last year. T h e
Universities Central Council on Admissions ( U C C A ) figures, released
in A p r i l , show that 13,292 foreign students have applied for a place
next October. Last year the figure was 20,528. O f the 7,236 reduction,
more than 5,500 were men.
The drop is relleeted in I C student numbers. T h e number of
applications for 1981/2 is not yet available, but 1980/T figures show a
reduction from 994 overseas students to 771. of which undergraduate
numbers are down ten percent, research students down twenty-live per
cent a n d advanced courses thirty-five per cent down.
This shortfall follows the enormous increases in overseas students'
lees in recent years. However despite the fears a n d warnings from
student unions, lecturers and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors.
C V C P , the Government has continued the full-cost fees policy. As
widely predicted, this policy has now led to not only a loss of revenue
but also d a m a g e to overseas relations. A t the A s s o c i a t i o n of
Commonwealth Universities meeting in H o n g K o n g last month,
Britain's decision to charge E E C students the same tuition fee as home
students brought a furious response.
U C C A figures also show a four per cent increase in home student
application, which gives an overall one per cent reduction.
