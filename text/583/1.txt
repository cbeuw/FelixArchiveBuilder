LAST WEDNESDAY, Mrs Shirley Williams launched Imperial
College's Social Democratic Society by giving a lecture on the
aims of the recently formed SDP.
The interest in M r s W i l l i a m s ' speech was such that it had to be
moved from its original venue to the Great H a l l to accomodate the
large number of students and staff.
M r s Williams began her speech by stating that the formation of the
S D P was a bold experiment. If the experiment failed the consequences
lor Britain would be, in her opinion, dire. II, however, the experiment
s u c c e e d e d B r i t a i n w o u l d have a t r u l y representative p a r t y i n
Westminster because no special interest group would be able to control
the party. Each member would have an equal vote in the governing of
the party.
Both major parties are so wrapped up with their own party dogmas
that they are blind to the fact that all they are doing is creating division
in the country and ultimately threatening democracy.
The introduction of a system of proportional electoral representation
would allow other parties, like the S D P , to be more fairly represented
at Westminster and eventually end the two party system.
The only current indication of the S D P ' s policies are the 'twelve
tasks' unveiled by the collective leadership of the party earlier in the
year. M r s Williams took the opportunity to elaborate on the future
policies of the S D P .
Britain's lack of recent economic success arose directly from the i n -
built class antagonism from both sides of industry.
Britain's lack of recent economic success arose directly from the ' i n -
built class antagonism' from both sides of industry. The S D P support
the idea of a mixed economy which encourages the Private Sector but
at the same time has a responsible attitude towards the Public Sector.
The party also has a responsible attitude towards employment. The
party would alleviate the problem by having relevant youth training
programmes which are currently totally inadequate. The party also
believes that Britain has an international responsibility and therefore
would support N A T O and the E E C whilst trying to change things
from the inside. Previous Governments have been far too callous and
shortsighted in their attitude towards the T h i r d W o r l d . H e r party
believes in a Marshall Plan for the T h i r d W o r l d countries, allowing
them to revitalise their economies. The Social Democrats believe in
unity, both nationally and internationally.
M r s Williams summed up by reiterating the fact that the S D P was a
party of all the people emancipated from divisions ol class.
There then followed a lively question session covering issues ranging
from Bobby Sands to British Aerospace.
22 students and 12 members of stall' joined the College Social
Democratic Society • directly after the lecture.
The S D P has substantial backing in Imperial College already. L o r d
Flowers, Rector of the College, has lent his support to the party in an
advertisement in The Guardian at the start of February and M r s
Williams' meting was chaired by Professor Sutton, Pro-Rector.

THE RCSU ANNUAL DINNER was held last Friday evening
in the Sherfield Building. Simon Jones, better known as
Arthur Dent of the successful radio and television series T h e
Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was the guest speaker.
H e was accompanied by D a v i d Learner (the man inside M a r v i n the
Paranoid Android) and special effects expert J i m Francis, who created
such diverse items as the robot suit and a radio-controlled head for
Zaphod Beeblebrox for the television adaptation.
R C S U H o n Sec, Steve Tyson was shocked on Thursday lunchtime
when he received a last minute cancellation from the show's author,
Douglas Adams, who had been expected to speak. Fortunately, Simon
Jones agreed to replace him at very short notice and gave a confident
and amusing speech.
D a v i d Learner later donned his M a r v i n costume and joined in the
festivities in the Senior C o m m o n R o o m .
W h e n asked how many people had attended M r Tyson said " I don't
know, I don't stand and count 'em, and it's not up to me to count them
either." (Really folks!)
