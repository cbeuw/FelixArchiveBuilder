Pseudonymous Letter
I know the real identity of the student who signed
a letter 'Ndabiningi Sithole, Chem 1' and if no
apology is received by next Wednesday, strong
action will- be taken in the next issue.

year's officers will be discussed.

mmmm
I know of a lecturer in social sciences who,
when he has an excess of marking to do, will
stand at the top of a flight of stairs and fling
an armful of essays towards the bottom.
Those which actually reach the bottom are
presumed heavier, therefore longer, therefore
more thorough; he awards each of these a B.
Those which land on the stairs are given a C,
D or E according to how far they travel.
At Primelia College (that bastion of
technology recently satirised in the New
Scientist) the logic professor has an equally
bizarre system of marking for the annual
essay he sets on 'The Relevence of Logic to
Mushroom Farming in the Outer Hebrides.'
To start with, he rejects most (but never all) of
the hundred-odd essays as being too awful to
merit a mark at all. He then gives each of the
remaining papers a mark from zero to ten.
This may not seem so bizarre, until I tell
you that the professor makes sure that the
first paper he marks is given the same number
of points as the number of papers he gives
zero to. (Got that?) Likewise, the second
paper he marks gets the same number of
points as the number of papers he gives one
point to. And the third paper gets the same
number of points as the number of papers
which get just two points, and so on, right to
the bottom of the pile of papers.
Naturally it would offend the professor's
pride in the elegance of his scheme if he ever
graded a pile of papers with the same marks
he had used before. How many years can the
professor's marking scheme last before he is
forced to repeat himself?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o
FELIX Office, please. There will be a prize of
£5 (donated by Mend-a-Bike) and two tickets
to the I.C. Orchestra concert next Friday for
the correct solution randomly selected at
1:00pm next Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution 14 Houses.
Honours List
Four people did all the Easter puzzles: Neili
Cooper, Atmospheric Physics PG, Roland
Marslin, Physics 3, Richard Tate, DoC RA,
ind Martin Taylor, DoC PG. Of these, Richard
Tate was randomly selected as the winner,
and he gets a £10 voucher, redeemable at
Mend-a-Bike, and £2 cash. In addition,
Richard won the individual prize for 'Chess of
Draws' which carries another £2. Neill won
the £2 prize for 'Piayfair Square', and Roland
won JAIT's Crossnumber. 'Eggheads' was
won by Simon Nuttall, Physics 1. And last
week's prize goes to C C Pantelides. Cheques
will be available in the FELIX Office on
Monday afternoon. Congratulations to all the
prizewinners, and everyone else who entered.
Other News
Many of my solvers are fed up with 'musical'
puzzles, and I'm certainly getting fed up with
setting them. So although this week's puzzle
isn't based on a musical theme, do please
note that IC Orchestra have given two free
tickets as a bonus prize to plug their concert
next Friday. And do go to the concert; if they
get a full house, we may not have to suffer
posters of such a nauseous hue around
college in future.
Is anyone prepared to help with my
takeover bid for the back page next week?
Steve's editorials are getting scrawnier every
week.
And so to the solutions of the Easter
puzzles...
Playfalr Square W A T C H S P R I N G

T h e original position w a s as s h o w n in the d i a g r a m .
B l a n c h e e x p e c t e d the m a c h i n e to castle, allowing

A s G r e y S p i d e r points out, the interesting thing
a b o u t this puzzle is not that the solution is difficult
t o f i n d , n o r t h a t it is p a r t i c u l a r l y e l e g a n t o r
i n g e n i o u s , but that it is unique.
A p o l o g i e s for the title ot this puzzle. Steve told m e

49. A l t h o u g h this p u z z l e is n o w h e r e near as difficult
as m a n y people m a d e it out to be, e x p l a i n i n g the
solution in full w o u l d be u n n e c e s s a r i l y tedious. S o I
shall outline the basic ideas, a n d if you're not
satisfied with that, write.
A s I w a l k d o w n t h e c o r r i d o r t h e l e c t u r e r s '
d i s c i p l i n e s (pure or applied) must rotate in c y c l e s of
six . . . P P P A A A P P P . . . T h e p r o b l e m is to find where
this s e q u e n c e is b r o k e n at the two e n d s of the
c o r r i d o r , b e a r i n g in m i n d t h a t t h e first m a n I
q u e s t i o n e d must have given a consistent answer
a b o u t t h e m a n at t h e o p p o s i t e e n d .
N o w . i n v e s t i g a t e all s i x p o s s i b i l i t i e s for t h e
d i s c i p l i n e s of the last three m e n I q u e s t i o n e d . If all
three are of the s a m e d i s c i p l i n e ( P P P o r A A A ) then
the first man's a n s w e r c a n only be consistent if the
n u m b e r of lecturers is of the form 6n, 6n+1 or
6n+2. If two of the three are of o n e discipline, a n d
the third is of t h e other, t h e n if the o d d o n e h a s a n
office at the e n d of the c o r r i d o r , the total n u m b e r of
lecturers is 6n, 6n-1 o r 6 n - 2 , a n d if the o d d o n e has
an office two from the e n d , the n u m b e r must be 6n,
6n+1 or 6 n - 1 . ( T h e o d d o n e c a n n o t have an office
o n e from the e n d of the corridor, b e c a u s e this w o u l d
violate the 'cycle of six' rule.)
N o w the o n l y possibilities for t h e total n u m b e r are
49, 56, 63, 70 a n d 77.
63 is of the form 6 n + 3 a n d so is impossible. S o the
lecturer w h o said '63' is a p p l i e d .
56 is of the form 6 n + 2 w h i c h is only possible if all
of the last three lecturers are of the s a m e discipline.
S o we eliminate 56
N o w if the third m a n lied, there are 70 (=6n-2) or
77 (=6n-1) lecturers in total. But this m e a n s there
must be at least o n e truth-teller a m o n g the final
three, w h i c h c o n t r a d i c t s o u r a s s u m p t i o n he lied.
T h u s he told the truth, a n d there are 49 lecturers.
