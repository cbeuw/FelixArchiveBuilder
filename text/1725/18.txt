triumph at the Battle
of Battersea, as pre-
viously reported by
Felix, Imperial’s top ath-
letes headed off to one of
the iconic parts of London
for the Westminster Mile,
a legacy event from the
2012 Olympics Games.
Starting on the Mall
facing towards Horse
Guards Parade, the one
mile route takes runners
around St. James’s Park
and along Birdcage Walk
before turning to finish
in front of Buckingham
Palace.
This year saw the first
ever London Universities
and Colleges Athletics
(LUCA)waveintheevent,
meaning athletes from
London’s universities had
the streets to themselves
for the duration of their
one mile lap.
With the runners as-
sembling on the start line
beneath the glistening
midday sun, the more re-
vision-focused members
of the squad came to the
realisation that the race
was being streamed live
by the BBC!
Following this revela-
tion the BBC’s viewing
figures increased by ap-
proximately 200 as Cross
Country and Athletics
members scrambled to
find the link to watch their
peers race against their
sworn London rivals.
Before they knew it
they were off and flying
down the first section,
with Imperial’s navy and
blue vests well represent-
ed in the exam-season
depleted field of the
London student athletics
scene.
Fantasy Football Club
Champion Niki Faulkner
hit the front early on, and
the online spectators were
delighted to hear spe-
cialist commentary from
the BBC who picked out
Niki, suggesting it was
an “individual time trial”
for the athlete, and that he
would have been aware of
this “from the beginning”.
In the background of
the shot from the lead
motorbike cameraman,
Mihaly Ormay, Matt
Ryan, Jim Warren, Alex
Mundell, Jack Teh, and
Steph Hewitt were all
within sight.
As the relatively short
race progressed, the
runners passed the giant
green figure of Arsenal
FC’s dinosaur mascot
- Gunnersaurus - who
was still making his way
around the course from an
earlier way. No wonder
dinosaurs are extinct.
With Niki nearing the
end of the race, the rest of
the field were becoming
more and more distant.
However, much to the
dismay of the commen-
tators, this did not stop
him looking behind him
to keep an eye on the
ever-increasing gap.
Meanwhile, as Niki
dipped across the line in
a time of 4:28, Imperial’s
dream team were building
for their sprint finish.
bromance of the year -
Matt Ryan and Jim Warren
- who both finished within
touching distance of one
another in 5:10, followed
by Jack Teh in a strong
5:28.
Whilst the men’s
category was somewhat
lacking in suspense, the
women’s title went all
the way to the line, as the
top two finished in the
same second - but it was
Imperial’s Alex Mundell
who took the title.
Knowing that ‘silver
salvers’ had been
promised for the top three
athetes, Steph Hewitt
made sure to stay ahead of
4th, ensuring she won the
smallest silver plate you
have ever seen.
In the LUCA Awards
presentation which
took place that evening
at Imperial, Imperial
College Cross Country
and Athletics took home
Club of the Year, thanks
to nominations from
non-Imperial athletes who
had spotted and admired
the club’s friendly, excited
atmosphere at events
throughout the year.
Individual awards
went to Women’s Captain
Charlotte Barratt for
widening participation
thanks to her supervision
of the new Couch-to-5k
group, Men’s Captain
Jack McKeon for Coach
of the Year due to his
excellent circuits sessions
every Monday evening,
and incoming Women’s
Captain Georgia Curry,
who picked up the award
for Female Athlete of
the Year following her
performances in the cross
country league and recent
athletics fixtures.
This weekend of
success ensured the club
finished the year on a
high, and hopefully many
athletes will continue to
compete over the summer
before returning to
College in October ready
to hit the cross country
season hard.
