T
he ninth Union
Awards cere-
mony was held
in Metric on
June 6th, and saw the
Union recognise and
commemorate its top
contributors for the year.
Winners included stu-
dents and societies who
demonstrated outstanding
effectiveness in their
roles, and have laid down
a legacy that will benefit
students long-term. The
winners are chosen from
nominations, by a student
panel appointed by the
Union President which
usually includes members
of the Union Council.
Ten specific awards
were given. Campaign
of the Year went to the
Believe and Do Good
campaign by the Muslim
Medics and Imperial
Islamic Society, while
the Event of the Year was
given to the Dance Impe-
rial Show, a collaboration
between all six dance
societies at Imperial.
The CGCU and Docsoc
Imperial hosts Prime Minister Theresa May
NEWS
(cont.)
won the Contribution to
College Life Award for
their Diversity in Engi-
neering initiative. The best
previously-existing and
new Club, Society, and
Project of the Year awards
were given to Design
Engineering and to ICSM
Coding respectively.
The awards for ac-
ademic and wellbeing
reps were distributed
across many departments.
Mathematics had both the
best wellbeing rep team
and individual academic
rep, which went to Bogosi
Shashane. The best
undergraduate academic
rep team was ICSMSU’s,
while the top postgraduate
team was Geotechnics’
Augustin Ruiz Lopes and
Julia Moeller. The award
for individual wellbeing
rep went to the RSM’s
Arman Sarjou.
Alongside these, 37
Union Colour awards
were given to individual
students who have made
repeated contributions
throughout the year. This
is significantly lower than
in previous years – 69
were awarded in 2017 and
2018. A further 17 Out-
standing Service awards
were given to those who
went even further “above
and beyond” their role.
Eight of the most signif-
icant contributors - those
who have contributed over
a number of years - were
awarded Fellowships,
which include honourary
life membership of the
Union. The winners of
these awards can be
viewed on the Union
website.
Among the Fellowship
earners was Joe O’Con-
nell-Danes, described as
the “heart and soul” of the
newspaper in his nomi-
nation. Joe served as the
Arts and Entertainment
Management Chair during
the year, and (amongst
other things) facilitated
the media coverage of
Meet the Candidates as
well as the IC Symphony
Ochestra's upcoming tour
of China. He shared what
the award meant to him:
“Receiving the fellow-
ship was a nice recogni-
tion of the work I've put
in over the last few years.
The nature of my role is
very operational - it in-
volves working behind the
scenes on issues that aren't
very creative or glamor-
ous, and if you’re doing it
well nobody should really
know much about it. In
fact, the highlight of the
awards evening wasn’t
my Fellowship, but Dance
Imperial winning Event
of the Year for the Dance
Imperial Show. The award
was a nice indication that
people have recognised
the work that goes into
this ‘behind the scenes’
maneuvering.”

Crawling to the finish line
T
his week marks
the penultimate
issue of Felix
for the year. I
know right, time really
flies! As we creep to
the end of my tenure as
Editor-in-Chief, people
keep asking me the in-
evitable question. "How
do you feel Andy? Is it
sad to be approaching
your final issue?" To
this, my honest answer
is: I'm tired. It hasn't
yet sunk in really that
my last issue is next
week. I'm sure if you
ask me the question this
time next week, I will
be overcome by a wave
of emotion but, for now,
it's business as usual.
Having said all that,
I have naturally been in
quite a reflective mood
over the last few weeks.
Especially given that, this
week, I started the hand-
over process with next
year's editor, Henry, I have
been doing a fair bit of
self-evaluation. If you ask
me, it's been a strong year
for the paper (though the
quality of the Editorials
has taken a real nose dive)
and I couldn't have done
it without the remarkable
efforts of the amazing
Felix Editorial team. It's
also been refreshing to
witness Henry's enthusi-
asm for Felix on a first-
hand basis and there's not
a shadow of doubt in my
mind that I'm leaving the
paper in safe and more
than capable hands.
In slightly more
sobering news, today
marks two years to the
day since the Grenfell
Tower disaster. At the
time, I was a third year
Chemical Engineering
2
student living in Ladbroke
Grove, a stone's throw
from Grenfell Tower. I
remember my housemate
telling me about the
sound of fire engine sirens
blaring through the night.
I remember seeing smoke
billowing from the tower
during my walk in to
College that morning. I
remember the gravity of
what had happened not
really sinking in until I got
back home after my last
exam that day and seeing
countless 'missing person'

posters stuck up around
the area. It is important
that we remember this dis-
aster. It is important that
we remember that it has
been two years and still
nobody has been held ac-
countable. It is important
that we remember that it
has been two years and
some of the victims are
still living in temporary
housing.
Section of the Week
for this week goes to the
Politics section, which
includes an extremely im-
portant article providing
an overview of the hu-
manitarian crisis currently
happening in Sudan,
written by my housemate,
Bozza. Next week's issue
of Felix will include a
follow-up article detailing
what we can do to help
but, for now, spreading
the word through social
media, etc. is helpful in
raising awareness of the
situation so that it reaches
mainstream news and
media outlets.
#IAmTheSudanRevo-
lution
expressed their admira-
tion of Imperial’s Carbon
Capture Pilot Plant and
the College’s wider work
in carbon capture and
storage, climate change
and energy research.
Claire Perry MP com-
mented, "it's an amazing
facility here... to me, this
is the Industrial Strategy
in action".
Speaking to Felix,
Ferdinand commented:
“The UK’s commitment
to net zero carbon
emissions by 2050 is
indeed exemplary and the
sort of radical decision
making required to curb
global warming. Carbon
capture and storage is an
imperative part of this and
the PM was able to get a
feel for the techniques,
scalability and problems
facing the technology. She
was full of questions and
seemed pleased with the
answers she got, as such
I’d consider the visit a
success.”
The PM and minister
also met PhD students,
Janet Skitt and Parth Shah,
who demonstrated their
work. Janet’s work, which
focuses on generating
liquid fuels from second
generation carbon neutral
fuels that are compatible
with existing vehicles,
could play a pivotal role in
decarbonizing transport.
Parth’s work revolves
around the continuous
synthesis of metal oxide
nanoparticles, while de-
veloping scalable, energy
efficient processes that
minimise waste water.
Prime Minister Theresa
May concluded her
visit with the following:
“As the first country to
legislate for long-term
climate targets, we can
be truly proud of our
record in tackling climate
change. We have made
huge progress in growing
our economy and the jobs
market while slashing
emissions. Now is the
time to go further and
faster to safeguard the
environment for our
children. This country led
the world in innovation
during the Industrial Rev-
olution, and now we must
lead the world to a cleaner,
greener form of growth.
Standing by is not an
option. Reaching net zero
by 2050 is an ambitious
target, but it is crucial that
we achieve it to ensure
we protect our planet for
future generations.”
“She was full
of questions
and seemed
pleased with
the answers
she got”
