We need an election

T
here have been
moments in
world politics
in the past four
years where I have been
surprised and perturbed
by the result. Post-election
hangovers are nearly
always the best way to
dull the immediate pain of
being slapped in the face
by certain events. At pre-
cisely 13:21 on Thursday
13th
June, I read the results
of the first round of voting
for the next Conservative
leader, and my ACC
hangover was completely
ruined. It is now obvious
that in concert with an
opposition leader that is at
best clueless and at worst,
criminally incompetent,
we shall have a Prime
Minister that is, at best,
criminally naive, and at
worst, criminal. I am, of
course, referring to the
walking, talking mound
of piss –yellow thatch that
is Boris Johnson. I cannot
wait for their symphony in
mismanagement.
In the first round of
voting, The Johnson, as he
is affectionately known by
those that bleed red, white
and blue and believe that
the Empire was a Good
Thing, was able to secure
114 votes to be Tory
leader. Jeremy Hunt and
Michael Gove, Boris’
nearest competition were
only able to obtain 43 and
37 votes, respectively.
Gove was probably too
busy snorting cocaine in
the boys’ toilets to garner
adequate support whilst
Jeremy Hunt’s pro-remain
stance means that his
campaign will be aborted
before he reaches the final
stages; just not by him.
The other candidates,
smiling Hannibal Lecter,
the depressed Humanities
teacher, Trump’s best
friend and that guy that
smoked weed one time,
are not likely to be able to
muster sufficient support
in the remaining time to
reach the final stage. It
is almost a certainty that
Boris will surpass the 1/3
of Tory MPs necessary to
reach the final stage. Here,
Boris and his opponent,
whether it is Gove or
Hunt, will be exposed to
the Tory membership that
will ultimately decide the
next Tory leader.
Boris’ rabid Brexiteer
stance, as well as his
fiscally irresponsible
tax cut proposals for the
wealthiest among us will
almost certainly resonate
very strongly with the
Tory membership. If they
weren’t already queuing
up to arthritically cross
the box with his name in
it, then they certainly will
be now. It doesn’t matter
that these plans are being
financed by a readjusted
budget ceiling that was
created to prepare for a
no-deal Brexit scenario
and that, in order to
finance them long term, it
will probably involve tax
cuts for the rest of us. Most
of them will already have
voted for fiscally irrespon-
sible things before, such
as errr... Brexit. Boris has
clearly hit on a winning
strategy. Promise unreal-
istic financial dividends
and reap the benefits.
Populist and dishonest
as it is, this has certainly
been an effective strategy
in patrimonial elections
throughout history.
His competitors, with
their carefully thought
through proposals, reek of
Remainer fear-mongering
and expert driven advice.
This will not go down
well with a membership
that wants big, brash, bold
promises to solve their
problems.
This is ultimately
the fundamental issue
with the Tory leadership
elections so far. 120,000
people will get to vote for
the Prime Minister that
will enact policies beyond
Brexit. These policies will
almost certainly afflict
the many to the benefit of
the few. The Tory party
membership are some of
the most rabid Brexiteers
and free marketeers that
you could possibly find.
I did see the BBC cast
tious internal civil war
should, of course, be per-
mitted, in order to provide
Boris with a cabinet as
rabid as its membership,
but ultimately there is a
responsibility to the dem-
ocratic institutions that
we all hold as sacred to
do the honourable thing.
Fight it out in the sphere
of public discourse, not
the safe space of the Tory
membership.

them as “passionate about
politics”, in an attempt to
legitimise the vote, but the
facts remain; if this were a
national election, promis-
ing tax cuts for the richest
members of society would
probably be political
suicide. However, with the
majority of the electorate’s
voice comfortably muted,
they can press ahead with
these promises.
The only way in which
the results of this election
can become legitimate are
if, following the election
of Bozza to the post of
Prime Minister, parlia-
ment is dissolved and a
general election is called.
The issue of the proximity
of Brexit is irrelevant.
120,000 people should
not possess the power
to dictate the course of a
nation of millions, where
we are, at least nominally,
a democracy. A brief
period to engage in frac-
