Cinderella: sculpture of a fleeting magical moment
C

W e e l d o n
creates magic
right next to
Imperial’s main campus
at the Royal Albert Hall,
in Cinderella, performed
by the English National
Ballet Philharmonic. A
retelling of the Brothers
Grimm fairy-tale, over
ninety dancers and a
live orchestra unfold a
dream-like sequence with
resplendent balls, forest
creatures and a familiar
love story.
Different from the
graduation setting that we
are more accustomed to,
the ice rink-shaped stage
of the Royal Albert Hall
is beautifully harnessed
with an entourage of light
projections, a chandelier,
and curtains, building
each scene to aid the sto-
rytelling. Whether this be
by the palace façade, or a
ballroom with portraits of
royalty (which change in a
comedic way), the setting
exudes a feeling of gran-
diosity that you cannot
help but want to be a
part of. The 18th century
costumes of the human
characters are gorgeous,
the creativity and comedy
of the woodland creature
costumes (massive puppet
and bird heads) equally
elaborate, and they all tie
into a wonderful, mesmer-
ising piece.
This opulence,
however, is frequently
disturbed for those seated
near the aisles as dancers
constantly scuttle back
tion into a beauty with silk
wings, and her stepmother
in a duet with her cham-
pagne glasses and waking
up hungover and puking
into the pot of porridge.
A routine with the
woodland creatures and
the comedic search for the
shoe’s perfect fit provided
a myriad of reactions,
from enthrallment to
laughter. Culminating in
(spoiler alert!) Cinderella
and Prince Guillaume’s
wedding, Cinderella gets
a happy ending despite
the trials and tribulations
of her stepmother and
stepsisters.
Alina Cojocaru
presents as a graceful and
elegant Cinderella, calm
and subservient to begin
with before eventually
taking hold of her own
destiny to meet strong-
willed Isaac Hernández as
Prince Guillaume. Where
the absence of the fairy
godmother disappointed
me, the strange, obfuscate
four Fates took over the
mysticism. Present in
the looming background
throughout, Fates moved
Cinderella across the
dining table, or just sat
splayed, watching her.
magical marvel. Crucial
to the fairy-tale, the love
story was sadly uncon-
vincing and lacked the
euphoria and exhilaration
Cinderella and Prince
Charming deserve. The
duet between the two,
although well performed,
didn’t portray the passion
and love a Cinderella
performance requires.
The show was spectac-
ular for the performance
as a whole, but not by
the ballet in isolation.
Weeldon’s interpretation
of the classic retells the
love story we are ever so
familiar with, but unfor-
tunately brings very little
to satiate any appetite for
the new or different. A
comforting show, Cinder-
ella promises to lighten
your mood and provide
an escape from deadlines
and exams, especially
when you know exactly
what to expect next in the
story.
A mesmerising albeit slightly unconvincing performance of a much-loved fairytale classic.

curious movement of the

just distracting and made
the transitions between

Rosmersholm
I
bsen wrote
R o s m e r s h o l m
(pronounced Ros-
mers-home) in 1886,
and it is considered to
be his masterpiece, over
The Wild Duck and A
Doll’s House. Yet it is
rarely staged. The day I
saw Rosmersholm was
ironically the day of the
European Elections, and
the parallels were aston-
ishing, regardless of the
vying for the vote and
for the backing of John
Rosmer (vividly por-
trayed by Tom Burke)
– town priest and landed
owner of the eponymous
Rosmersholm. Unfortu-
nately for the two parties,
Rosmer himself has lost
his faith and renounced
his family’s wealth, prac-
tically throwing heirlooms
at his staff. This sudden
change follows the suicide
of his wife the previous
year, and the urging of
Rebecca West (the breath-
taking and show-stealing
Hayley Atwell), whose
progressive beliefs of
equality and politics spur
Rosmer to act in the best
way for the people.
Hamilton’s Giles Terera
is worryingly charming
as an almost-fascist local
governor determined
to sway brother-in-law
almost absurd, especially
regarding Rebecca’s past,
but Atwell and Burke are
so convincing in their
respective losses, it is
accepted and embraced.
The costumes by
Rae Smith were divine,
with the set and lighting
used to an incredible
degree to show not only
the passing of time, but
also the growth of the
characters. The sound
design was haunting yet
not overwhelming, with
almost-leitmotifs associ-
ated with concepts rather
than specific people.
The turning of the water
wheel, in particular, and
its importance to Rosmer,
Rebecca and the town, is
foreboding and cleverly
brings our attention to the
minutiae of the dialogue.
Stunning imagery is
utilised, none more so
than the final one, with
the ominous sound of
the water wheel coming
to a stop and a lone man
standing against the
floods of change.
A stunning production of Ibsen’s lesser known classic is more relevant than ever.

Ibsen’s Nordic noir is

when it is, it is timely.
In 2008, the world was

there was the Queen’s
annus horribilis amongst
other political fiascos. It’s
a play that inspires change
in its audience, in the way
of life imitating art.
