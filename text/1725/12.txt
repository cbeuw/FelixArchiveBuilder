“Just 19% of

its standard in 2013, the
WWF and others stated
that the changes had not
gone far enough to address
the issue. The WWF has
argued that RSPO stand-
ards have fallen short in
terms of greenhouse gas
emissions, banning of
the most harmful chem-
icals like paraquat, and
ensuring that only legal
palm oil was entering
mills. Several leading
growers agreed, and indi-
vidual brands and growers
have made their own “no
deforestation” commit-
ments since then.
It can be argued that
the pace of change is too
slow. 14 million tonnes
of palm oil is RSPO cer-
tified, which is just 19%
of global palm oil produc-
tion. This low proportion
of sustainably-sourced
palm oil is despite
commitments made by
major manufacturers and
producers of palm oil to
source 100% of palm oil
sustainably by the mid-
2010s, a deadline which a
considerable number have
failed to meet.
Furthermore those who
have had adopted certifi-
cation initially struggled
to find demand. Nearly
half (48.3 %) of the 8.59m
tonnes of certified palm oil
produced in 2013 failed
to attract a buyer. This is
a huge issue since the oil
itself was sold at the same
price as conventional
palm oil and therefore
didn’t give the incentive
for producers to get their
oil certified.
However, government
regulation can be effective
in creating change. In
2014, the EU introduced
legislation mandating
transparent labelling of
palm oil on all products.
This means that it must
be explicitly labelled,
as opposed to listed as a
generic “vegetable oil”
or other synonyms. In the
first two quarters of 2014
there was a 65 % increase
in sales of certified palm
oil. The governments of
Malaysia and Indonesia
have introduced legisla-
tion on palm oil producers
which is essentially a
‘watered down’ version
of RSPO criteria. Govern-
ment legislation both by
palm oil-producing coun-
tries and by countries that
are the largest consumers
of palm oil can be effec-
tive in tackling the issue.
Conclusion
Palm oil is an incredi-
bly energy efficient crop
compared to other oil
crops - it requires fewer
resources to grow and
produces up to three times
more oil in the same area
of land. Replacing palm
oil with any of its sub-
stitutes will be worse for
the environment, as more
land will be needed to
yield the same amount of
oil. Furthermore, some of
the properties of palm oil
mean other oils would be
unsuitable.
Having said that, de-
forestation due to agricul-
ture is a very real problem
in many countries. The
largestusersofpalmoilare
manufacturers, and thus
pressure must be placed
on industry to ensure they
meet standards. Govern-
ment legislation can be
effective in achieving
this, as demonstrated by
the impact of mandatory
transparent labelling in
the EU. Furthermore,
by making informed
choices, customers can
have an impact. Instead of
boycotting palm oil com-
pletely, opting for sus-
tainably grown palm oil
from certified producers is
a good first step towards
sustainability. A further
steps would be to ensure
that palm oil is fully
traced (not just mixed).
Despite there being some
concerns about the rigor
of palm oil certification,
certification brings trans-
parency throughout the
supply chain and forces
producers to be more
mindful of their environ-
mental impact.

“Palm oil has a
very high yield

P
alm oil is a widely
used vegetable
oil derived from
the fruits of the
African oil palm. This
article aims to summarize
the implications of grow-
ing production and export
of palm oil, primarily
from South-East Asia and
the controversial question
of its sustainability and
certification.
Palm oil has a very
high yield compared to
other vegetable oils. In
2011 it produced 22% of
the world’s vegetable oil
despite using less than
2% of the area used for
growing oil crops. Palm
oil is often grown on
newly cleared forests, as
producers use the profit
from timber to subsidise
setting up a new planta-
tion. Due to this, palm
oil plantations have led
to destruction of natural
habitats and thus driven
native wildlife to face
extinction. Certified sus-
tainable sources of palm
oil try to strike a balance
in being environmentally
friendly and economically
viable.
What is the big deal
Is palm oil production
leading to habitat loss?
Most likely yes. A study
using information from
satellite imagery and the
Food and Agriculture
Organization of the UN
found that a significant
proportion of land which
was covered in forest in
1990 was used for palm
oil production by 2015 in
Malaysia and Indonesia.
This is particularly con-
cerning as the peat-rich
soil in these regions con-
tinues to release GHGs
from soil for decades after
deforestation.
Is palm oil produc-
tion responsible for
the dramatic decline in
orangutan populations
in Indonesia? A study of
orangutan populations
on the Indonesian island
of Borneo found that
50% of the population
was affected by natural
resource extraction, in-
cluding deforestation for
oil palm plantations, and
also found a decline in the
Bornean orangutan popu-
lation of 100,000 between
1999 and 2015. However,
the same study found
that the greatest factor in
the decline in orangutan
populations was likely
hunting, while clearing
for oil crops was responsi-
ble for approximately 9%
of species decline.
more harm. The WWF
argue that palm oil “has
the potential to be a major
force for sustainable de-
velopment”.
Also, according to
the WWF, of the top
five UK-based users
of palm oils, four are
manufacturers including
Reckitt Benckiser (which
produces Dettol, Cillit
Bang and uses 125000
tonnes) and United
Biscuits (McVitie’s, go
ahead!, 76000 tonnes) and
one is a retailer (Tesco,
31000 tonnes). All of
these use 100% Certified
Sustainable Palm Oil
(CSPO). However, few
have ensured that the
palm oil is from segregat-
ed sources, meaning that
geographical origin for
many is unknown.
Palm oil is used in
over 50% of supermar-
ket products ranging
from bread to shampoo.
Reasons for its abundance
include its availability,
low cost and favourable
chemical properties
for a wide range of
applications. It also has
low levels of trans fats,
which are associated with
cardiovascular diseases,
compared with other oils.
Furthermore GHG
emissions in the growth
and production of oil
palm are relatively
small, setting aside any
deforestation, compared
with other oils, and the
Roundtable on Sustain-
able Palm Oil (RSPO)
has developed a tool for
palm oil producers to
monitor and control the
GHG emissions in their
operations.

with palm oil?
Anumber of issues have
been raised regarding the
use of palm oil, including
claims that it is a leading
cause of deforestation and
decline in populations of
wildlife - in particular,
orangutans. In addition,
there are concerns over
the social welfare of
plantation workers and
greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in production.
Some big brands in
the UK have reacted by
boycotting palm oil; for
instance, Iceland pledged
in 2018 to “remove palm
oil from all [its] own label
products” in a planned TV
ad at Christmas. Holland
and Barrett no longer
stocks raw palm oil, even
from certified sources.
However, since palm oil
is the highest-yielding
oil crop, and millions of
farmers rely on it for their
livelihood, boycotting
palm oil is likely to cause
tion?
The RSPO is an interna-
tional non-profit consorti-
um of palm oil industry
stakeholders. It issues a
set of environmental and
social criteria which pro-
ducers must comply with
in order for their palm oil
to be labelled as CSPO.
Palm oil growers must
be assessed for certifica-
tionbytheRSPOregularly
in order to continue to be

Is certification a com-
plete solution?

criticism regarding
certification of palm oil.
