Founders of Impromptu share the story of its development

readers! This
week Tom and
I move into
more personal territory,
touching on the beginning
of our journey as entre-
preneurs. This will be
followed next week by
a final piece detailing
Impromptu itself.
The inspiration for
our decision to create
an app stems from our
time as PhD students in
the Faculty of Medicine.
For years we had talked
about random app ideas;
several of which launched
at a later date and became
very successful. We even-
tually realised that it was
pointless having these
conversations (and the
subsequent depression!)
unless we were willing to
take the proverbial bull by
the horns and act upon our
ideas.
Our aim was always
to develop an app which
would benefit university
students and academics.
If we could also extend
this idea to society at
large, even better. Our
initial brainstorming
sessions yielded no short
of a dozen ideas. To our
credit we were able to
immediately recognise
that the majority of these
were poorly thought
through and devoid of any
significant USPs. Twelve
became two! At this time
Tom and I decided to
meet with someone who
had been recommended to
“The

us as a potential partner.
Our team grew, adding
relevant industry exper-
tise. This gentleman was
smart, personable and
established in the tech
world. We collectively
selected our preferred
idea, a community based
lending platform, and set
about realising this by de-
signing our own prototype
using online resources.
Our background
research into the viability
of this idea was favoura-
ble. Our goal was to be as
self-sufficient as possible
and to design and build the
platform without seeking
expert help. In hindsight
this was a mistake. Our
choice of name was spot
on. Our colourways were
great. But our knowledge
of branding, functionality
and back-end (databases
and so on) left a lot to be
desired. Our new partner
was also finding himself
incredibly busy with two
young children and his
day job (his employer had
recently been acquired
by Microsoft). Despite
his best intentions he
was finding it harder to
allocate time to the project
and the technical aspects
he was expert in.
This state of limbo
went on for months before
we formally approached
a development house.
This was exciting to say
the least and also served
to reaffirm confidence in
our ideas. The developers
were keen and offered
to build our prototype
for a small upfront cost.
This was to include high
resolution mock ups of
20 screens, branding,
colourways and technical
specifications.
The next two months
saw various changes in the
team and the near-com-
pletion of our prototype.
We were almost there, or
knowing we would have
to adapt functionality to
compete, or change track
entirely.
The former was simply
not viable for a number
of reasons. We had no
alternative but to start
again. As you can imagine
this was disheartening.
However, the decision to
pursue this first idea was
narrowly won and we
had an alternative which
we were very passionate
about and which our
developers thought was
easier to implement. Our
developers took pity on
our situation and were
kind enough to allow us
to switch ideas without
penalty. This idea was to
become Impromptu.
As I’m sure you can
gather, our journey to date
hasproventobesomewhat
of a rollercoaster. This
is not dissimilar to many
others in our position and
is not meant to deter you.
Rather we hope to illus-
trate that there are often
solutions to seemingly
massive problems.
Join us next week where
we detail our app and its
functionality.

so we thought.
The final week of pro-
totyping brought some un-
welcome news. A startup
had just launched with
exactly the same idea.
Furthermore, they had
executed the idea nicely
and had announced the
procurement of significant
funding. We were left with
a dilemma; continue on,
