Breaking the Taboo on Eating Disorders

F
our years ago this
week, I remember
completing my
UCAS form and
putting Imperial as my
first-choice university. At
the time, I was oblivious
really to my falling mental
and physical health. My
eating disorder started
long before Imperial but
it wasn’t until I got here,
away from my family and
support, that I realised
just how overwhelming
an eating disorder can be.
Eating disorders are
difficult illnesses to
cope with and there is
a lot of misinformation
about them. The media,
in some ways, glorifies
eating disorders and never
addresses the true crux of
problem. In some cases,
eating disorders are about
body image. However,
it’s not that simple; not
all eating disorders are
about weight loss and the
majority of eating disorder
sufferers are not under-
weight. Eating disorders
are about control and
perfection. The sufferer
feels out of control when
eating and then might go
to great lengths to regain
control over eating, which
manifests as dangerous
behaviour.
less than 80% probably
means you wouldn’t
make your grade offer for
this institution, fosters a
level of perfectionism.
Then being thrown into
an environment where
perfectionism in academia
is nigh-on impossible is
a bigger challenge than
anyone really admits.
For seven years, we have
been trained to believe
the university expectation
of a “good score” is just
simply not good enough.
This drastic change can
leave high-performing
students feeling vulnera-
ble and out-of-control.
and body image, I didn’t
even notice the illness run
away from me until I was
very much under its grasp.
Getting help for my
eating disorder was a
long process. Ultimately,
I was in denial and an
over reliance by doctors
on BMI can mean it is
difficult to access the
support needed. There is
dangerous underfunding
of eating disorder care,
which means you can
be “not ill enough” to
access the therapy you
so desperately need. This
is something battled tire-
lessly by campaigners but
it can make accessing care
tricky. BEAT, an eating
disorder awareness charity
have some excellent
advice on how to negoti-
ate that first meeting with
a doctor. Being prepared
massively helped because
even when I got upset or
found it difficult to talk, I
had already planned what
to say. The support BEAT
gives is excellent and I
remember being on the
phone with one of their
advisors the night before,
talking me through the
appointment and what to
expect.
I was already seeing a
doctor about my mental
health before that ‘first
meeting about eating’.
My first appointment was
difficult, I didn’t feel like
I managed to convey my
behaviour with food and
the whole consultation
revolved around BMI
and weight. It would
take another two months
before I went for another
appointment. The second
time I was switched to
someone else last minute
and she seemed to take my
concern more seriously.
I was eventually referred
onto a medical study
looking at the impact of
early intervention therapy
in eating disorder recovery
and luckily accessed
therapy soon after my
referral. I say “lucky”;
five years with an eating
disorder I was still classed
as “early-intervention”.
There were times at
Imperial I felt very alone.
Due to an outdated and
frankly horrendous notion
that eating disorders only
affect teenage girls, I felt
that I was the only person
who could possibly be
walking around in this
position. I was embar-
rassed to admit how much
it was impacting my work,
my relationships and my
enjoyment of university.
When I did reach out for
help, I would categorically
refuse to tell any member
of staff, mental health first
aider or university coun-
sellor that I had an eating
disorder. It was a secret I
guarded very closely until
the hold anorexia had was
so strong that it became
noticeable to my close
friends.
Sometimes waiting for
a doctor’s appointment
or a counselling appoint-
ment can be too long. I
found charity helplines or
message boards were able
to give me in-the-moment
support until my next
appointment. Relapse is
a part of recovery; every
relapse back to poor
behaviour with food felt
like another failure. When
I did relapse, the BEAT
message boards or Samar-
itans phoneline helped me
get back on the right road
much quicker than waiting
for an appointment with a
counsellor. Even if it were
just a reminder of why I
wanted to get better in the
first place.
“Not all eating
disorders are
about weight
loss and the
majority of
eating disorder
sufferers are
not under-
weight”
Now, I’m not saying
that A-levels or Imperial
gave me an eating
disorder. What they did
was contribute to the
lack of control that I
was already feeling due
to events in my own
personal life. Whether my
perfectionism put me at
a ‘predisposition’ for an
eating disorder is neither
something I dispute, nor
something I can really
change. On some levels,
perfectionism makes me
a good scientist but it
is unmanageable in this
environment.
I had to get some
control back. Eating,
weight, body shape, that
was something I could
control. Mixed in with
some poor self-esteem
“There were
times at
Imperial I felt
very alone”
I can’t thank my friends
enough. My friends
weren’t there to help solve
my problems or advise.
They’re not trained to deal
with it and nor is it fair for
them to have that kind of
pressure. However, they
were there in so many
other ways; they would
sit with me one-on-one
because having lunch
in large groups was too
frightening, convince me
to book an appointment
with the doctor or take me
for coffee before hospital
appointments I was really
worried about. Their will-
ingness to support made
the road to recovery seem
almost doable. I felt like,
even though no one knew
how I felt, I wasn’t alone
anymore.
way to relieve the pressure
and stress I was under.
This gave me a release of
tension and allowed me to
cope with and take control
of my anxieties rather than
having to restrict my food
intake or exercise obses-
sively. Getting running
back under control was a
huge hurdle to recovery,
and keeping it as a way
to relieve stress and not to
burn calories is at times a
struggle, but it introduced
me to some great new
friends and gave me
a place to process my
problems in my own time.
The extra endorphins and
serotonin gave me a little
boost in my day-to-day
mood, which anti-de-
pressants never managed.
Most importantly, when I
fell in love with running, I
fell out of love with losing
weight. I began to realise
I needed to fuel by body.

disorders
are about

perfection”
Coming from A-levels,
where you are expected
to obtain >90% in exams
to get an A* and anything

thing that
helped my

Finally, the biggest
thing that helped my
recovery was finding a
“However
hard it is, the
more I started
talking, the
easier it got”
Six months into my
second degree at Imperial
and officially half way
through my total time
spent here, I have learnt
a few important lessons
about my mental health.
Firstly, however hard it is,
the more I started talking,
the easier it got. Secondly,
everyone needs a coping
mechanism; some are far
better than others. Finally,
even though I don’t know
anyone else at Imperial
with an eating disorder, I
know no one else is alone.
