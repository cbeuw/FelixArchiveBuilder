Highlights from the Electronic Entertainement Expo

E
3 is drawing to a
close but the big
reveals have al-
ready happened.
There are many games re-
leasing this year and next
year which we get to look
forward to, but let’s dig
into the highlights from
some of the conferences.
EA
After multiple contro-
versies with the Star Wars
Battlefront series from
DICE, EA is now trusting
Respawn Entertainment
with Star Wars Jedi:
Fallen Order. This E3 saw
gameplay reveals for the
game which apparently
played better behind the
scenes than on stage.
EA’s money maker, FIFA
20 was also shown off
with some new gameplay
mechanics to make the
experience more varied.
Season 2 ofApex Legends
was started of with a
double XP weekend, a
new character and a new
gun, with the developers
of Anthem learning a lot
from the mixed reviews.
Microsoft
Project Scarlett has
a 2020 release and it
is launching with Halo
Infinite. It’s expected to be
four times more pwoerful
than the Xbox One and
will have a non-mehcnai-
cal SSD, for faster laoding
time.
Though one could say
that it was CD Projekt
Red which stole the Mi-
crosoft conference with
the reveal of Cyberpunk
2077, and brining Keanu
Reeves on stage as John
Wick is now a character
called Johnny Silverhand.
He was breathtaking.
The Project xCloud
will soon be open for
public testing in October.
It is Microsoft’s game
streaming service and
it promises to delover a
high quality experience to
smartphones.
Bethesda
Bethesda apologised.
Bethesda acknowledged
their mistake. Bethesda
took a humble approach
to the mixed response to
Fallout 76 and has now
planned a lot of content
for the year 2 of the game.
If you thought Fallout 76
was a barren wasteland,
then the NPCs set to
to populate this world
will change your mind.
Besides NPCs, there will
be a Battle Royale mode.
The attention for the
Bethesda conference was
turned to Doom Eternal
which is looking to be an
amazing game in single
and multiplayer.
Ubisoft
If you have not had
enough of London at your
time at Imperial, nor had
enough of Brexit, then
get prepared for Watch
Dogs: Legion. It is set
in a post-Brexit London.
Ubisoft has also intro-
duced its own gaming sub-
scription service adding to
the increasingly saturated
market for video game
subscription services. The
Just Dance series is also
now celebrating its 10th
anniversary
PCGamingShow
Deep Silver might
be blacklisted from the
libraries of many gamers
as Shenmue 3 has finally
been revealed as an Epic
Games Store exclusive.
The controversy sur-
rounding this was due to
Lots of anonucements have been dropped over the past couple of weeks, some quite breathtaking, some needing
a graphical upgrade.

“Four years
have passed
since the initial
reveal of Final
Fantasy VII:
Remake”
Kickstarter backers of the
game being promised a
Steam Key, which is now
just a fantasy.
Square Enix
Four years have passed
since the initial reveal
of Final Fantasy VII:
Remake at E3 2015 and
now we have a March
2020 release (for Part 1). T
Midgar has been expanded
into a standalone game, so
it might be a few years
before we see the Remake
in its entirety though.
“Bethesda

mastered for this game’s
20th year anniversary.
Marvel’s Avengers: A
Day opened to some quite
mixed reception. Most
likely as some fans were
hoping to see the MCU
Avengers recreated within
the game.
Nintendo
Let’s be real. We all
expected a character
reveal for Super Smash
Bros Ultimate at E3.
So what did Nintendo
do? They revealed two
characters - The Hero
from the Dragon Quest
series (Japan’s beloved
RPG series) and Banjo &
Kazooie raring into the
fight from Banjo-Kazooie.
Zelda has a new
haircut, Ganondorf’s body
(though looking very
lifeless) finally makes an
appearance during the
Breath of the Wild era
of The Legend of Zelda
series. A direct sequel is
now in development for
the Breath of the Wild.
It was quite appropriate
to give Squall a face for
Final Fantasy VIII Re-
