A Review of Petals of Blood
A deeply empathetic story set in post-colonial Kenya
I
n a sentence, Petals
of Blood is a story
of change through
the eyes of those
oppressed. The author,
Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, uses
the murder, by arson, of
three prominent figures
in an emerging town
to frame the narrative
of the transformation
of a backward (or un-
blemished?) village
into a prospering (or
soulless) town. Its cast
of protagonists: Munira,
the teacher and flawed
hero, Karega, one of
his former students,
Abdulla, a crippled busi-
ness man and Wanja,
a strong-willed but
mercurial prostitute, are
symbols for the means
by which the people
are oppressed. It is a
deeply empathetic and
deeply intelligent novel,
alluding to Shakespeare
and the Bible with equal
ease as to former leaders
of the Kenyan resist-
ance and early British
colonists. For instance,
together with the op-
pressors, the characters
map unexpectedly to
those in a passage from
Walt Whitman quoted
by Ngũgĩ, “frightened
monarchs come back;
Each comes in state,
with his train - hangman,
priest, tax-gatherer,
Soldier, lawyer, lord,
jailer, sycophant”.
Although they are clear-
ly symbols of something
greater, Ngũgĩ does
create multi-dimen-
sional and rich figures
whose stories, although

interconnected with
masterful serendipity,
are slowly revealed as
we journey through the
book. The one character
whose story I feel could
be told better is Karega,
whose tale is told large-
ly in intermittent bursts
of drunken monologue.
I found it a challeng-
ing read because it is a
book not written, as the
majority to be found in
the English language,
for consumption by
white Europeans and
Americans. Indeed,
it is probably these
who Ngũgĩ refers to as
the white tourists or
“watalii” who unsus-
pectingly buy fruits and
sheepskins from charac-
ters such as the destitute
Karega on the roadside.
There is so much rich
culture and history that
I feel is inaccessible to
me as a white European
lacking the oral heritage
of Africa and, although
painful, I found it a
welcome discovery. The
book is a message of
lament for the suffering
endured by a nation,
of caution about the
promises of “develop-
ment”, and of hope to
Kenya of the 1970s. It
is a message addressed
by Ngũgĩ, perhaps to
his fellow countrymen,
or maybe to himself.
Either way, it was
clearly a message heard
since, like Karega in
Petals of Blood, he was
imprisoned shortly after
for his publication of a
play, Ngaahika Ndeenda
(“I will marry when I
want”).
One lesson that stood
out to me from Petals
of Blood is how capi-
talism has the potential
to destroy culture. That
is to say, the actual
stories of the people
affected. What might
be counted as progress
by international devel-
opment organisations
leads, in the story, to the
destruction of culture
and local self-sufficien-
cy. When the villagers
create an enterprise out
of Thenget’a, a drink
brewed occasionally as
part of local tradition,
a monstrous narcotic
monopoly is created
which overturns the
lives of many, including
Munira, and is quickly
taken over by powerful
Kenyan elite and inter-
national corporations.
Furthermore, this was
facilitated by the con-
struction of a major
road through the village
which supplied thirsty
road workers and truck
drivers - the first unwit-
ting customers. Though
the village becomes
famous, the herdsmen
are no longer depend-
ent on fickle rains and
the owners of the new
businesses have access
to businesses and trade,
the ones who created
the transformation of
the village into a town
become destitute while
powerful politicians and
businessmen profit.
Though I cannot speak
for the relevance of the
book to modern-day
Kenyans or if the story
reflects historical devel-
opment of any village,
I can say that the book
is a precious unfiltered
glimpse into a rich
and largely unwritten
culture of the country.
It gives an understand-
ing of the country that
will be missed by those
who only read books of
African history produced
by white academics,
those who follow tourist
books, or go on package
safari holidays. I am
very grateful for having
found this precious gem
of a book in the Imperial
College library, espe-
cially in a University
that sadly shares its
name with the force that
caused so much of this
suffering.
