T
he College held
its final major
careers event
of the year this
past Tuesday, helping
students looking for jobs
with companies with less
than honourable public
reputations.
Held in the Business
School (naturally), the
aptly-titled ‘Unethical
Careers Fair’ had been
previously advertised
to students looking to
“maximise their earnings
without caring about
social reponsibility and
other similarly foolish
millenial concepts”, ac-
cording to the circulated
e-mail invite.
Rebecca Foghorn,
Co-ordinator of the
Careers Service, was
steadfast in her depart-
ment’s decision to host
the event. “Well they’
were all going to fuck off
to where the money’s at
anyway," she maintained,
“so let’s not kid ourselves
by offering them actual
science jobs they’re not
going to take.”
The event was met
with a sizeable turnout
from students, with many
engaging with available
companies, in at least one
instance crying at the feet
of a recruiter for a job. “I
mean, being an eco- and
social justice warrior
makes me feel good,” said
Jamar Chaudry, final year
Chemistry student, “but so
does money, and I intend
to make lots of money.
Why not sell my soul to
the devil? This place has
crushed it anyway.”
Companies present
included Shell, Exxon-
Mobil, and Amazon, all
of whom were known
contributors to College
Autocrat Clarice Blast’s
recent purchase of prime
fracking land in the north-
west of England.

College hosts Unethical Careers Fair for desperate
students
This week you allow
yourself to be used as
a tool of an oppressive
system used to keep the
man down.
Never again are you
agreeing to write the
horoscopes.
This week your body
hasn’t quite understood
you’ve finished your
degree.
Your 10:30 AM
breakdown happens as
scheduled.
This week after your last
exams, you get back into
binging your favourite
Netflix show.
It’s just not the same
without the guilt.
This week the postman
accidentally drops off
your parcel at your
neighbour’s.
She sends her son to hand
over the butt plugs you
ordered.
This week your
supervisor asks you to
present results of your
simulation to the group.
She’s not impressed when
you show her your Sims
family
This week you get ready
to live your best life this
summer. Unfortunately
the weather has other
plans for your life.
Talk about systematic
oppression.
This week you’re
Michael Gove. You
believe being a leader is
knowing where to draw
lines in the sand.
Too bad you just end up
snorting them.
This week you decide to
get into Love Island since
you’re not doing anything
anyway.
Suddenly Quantum Field
Theory is sounding like a
nice distraction.
This week you seem to
be releasing pheromones
into the atmosphere,
because you keep getting
chased by Mormons.
This week your group
project members decide
to all fuck off on holiday
before your 4pm write-up
deadline.
Time to get the battery
acid out.
This week you’re the
NegaFelix editor.
Can’t wait to attend
Alice Gast’s top secret
Illuminati party yay!

– Fake News! –
“Well they
were all going
to fuck off
to where the
money’s at
anyway...”
The event connected
both companies and
students who similarly
give no fucks about
corporate social
resposibility.
