2018, hundreds
of people pro-
tested in Atbara
and several other cities in
Sudan against the rising
costs of living and dramat-
ic worsening of economic
conditions. Even bread,
a commodity we take
for granted, tripled in
price. The protests spread
quickly to other cities,
including the capital,
Khartoum, demanding for
President Omar al-Bashir
to step down. in 2011, leading to a de-
valuation of the Sudanese
pound and huge increases
in inflation. Without
South Sudan’s oil output
to help strengthen the
Sudanese pound, there
was a shortage of cash
in circulation. People
would have to regularly
queue for many hours
for petrol, bread and to
simply withdraw cash
from ATMs.
By early January
2019, deaths were being
reported in anti-Bashir
protests in the city of
Omdurman. Over 800
anti-government protest-
ers (opposition leaders,
activists and journalists)
had been arrested by the
widely feared National
Intelligence and Security
Service (NISS). On 22nd
February, Bashir declared
a nationwide year-long
state of emergency. As Al
Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan
said, the state of emer-
gency gives the “military
the right to arrest anybody
they deem a threat to
the country’s national
security and economic
development.” This
would translate to more

On 6th
April, thousands
protest outside the army
headquarters, which
also houses president
Al-Bashir’s residence.
This was organised by the
Sudanese Professionals
Association (SPA), a
union which has taken an
increasingly prominent
role in these anti-govern-
ment protests.As the sit-in
at the military headquar-
ters continued throughout
the week, social media
was blocked and the
power was cut all over
Sudan. Over the weekend,
the rapid reaction force
of the secret services was
trying to attack protestors
coming from the north
and the army took the side
of the protestors and fired
back. This resulted in six
deaths, 57 injuries and
2500 arrests in the capital.
On 11th
April, the army
announced that Bashir
has been removed from
power and detained. It
was also declared that
a Transitional Military
Council will be replacing
Bashir for two years. The
TMC is currently headed
by career soldier, General
Abdel Fattah al-Burhan,
after public pressure
forced General Awad Ibn
Ouf to resign as leader
only one day after the
coup d’état. On 15th
April,
marking the tenth day
of protests outside army
headquarters, demonstra-
tors demanded a power
transfer to a new civilian
government. Protest
leaders announced plans
to create their own transi-
tional council if the TMC
refused to step aside.
TMC leader, al-Burhan
maintained that the
TMC was “committed to
handing over power to the
people.” However, protest
leaders did not believe
that the military junta was
serious about transferring
power to civilians and that
the council consisted of
remnants of al-Bashir’s
regime. As a result,
protests intensified.
On 24th
April, in
response to the protestors’
demands, three military
council generals submit-
ted their resignations.
Three days later, an
agreement was reached
to form a joint civilian
military ruling council.
On 15th
May, a three-year
transition period to full
civilian administration
was agreed. However,
as both sides wanted to
have a majority, talks
between protestors and
the military council
became deadlocked with
no accord on the make-up
of the ruling body. This
resulted in the launch of a
two-day national strike to
put pressure on the ruling
military to hand over
power to a civilian-led
authority. The SPA en-
couraged people to show

from any activity. A group
of employees were heard

Al-Bashir was the ruler
of Sudan for a span of
thirty years, between June
1989 and April 2019. He
is wanted by the Inter-
national Criminal Court
(ICC) for war crimes,
genocide and crimes
against humanity commit-
ted in the Darfur region
of Sudan. Since Omar
Al-Bashir’s ascension to

Byblos Bank headquar-
ters. General Mohammed
Hamdan Dagalo
(commonly known as
Hemedti, deputy head of
the military council) crit-
icised the strike, saying,
“this situation doesn’t
lead the country forward”
and that “we are part of
the revolution, without the
armed forces and without
the security apparatus,
Omar al-Bashir would
stay in power until now.”
On 3rd
June, the TMC’s
security forces, including
the Rapid Support Forces
(RSF, formerly the Jan-
jaweed) led by Hemedti,
used force to disperse
thousands camped at the
army headquarters. Live
ammunition was used, as
well as physical assault
and sexual violence.
This coincided with a
shutdown of the internet
imposing a de facto media
blackout. More than 100
civilians were killed and
750 seriously injured in
the Khartoum massacre.
Security forces also
opened fire on protestors
inside medical facilities.
The World Health Or-
ganization (WHO) stated
that emergency and health
services were forced to
shut down. Tent clinics
set up to treat wounded
protestors were destroyed
and healthcare workers
assaulted. Furthermore, at
least 40 bodies were found
dumped in the River Nile
and many remain missing.
Sudanese political car-
toonist, Khalid Albaih,
described Dagalo as
“Sudan’s version of Saudi
Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman…young, pow-
er-hungry and ruthless.”
Indeed, one factor behind
Hemedti’s power is his
support from regional
allies(Egypt,SaudiArabia
and UAE). According
to Al Jazeera, Hemedti
met with Mohamed Bin
Salman in May, promising
to support Saudi Arabia
against Iran and Houthi
militias by continuing to
send Sudanese troops.
Therefore, it would be
in the prince’s interest to
preserve a strong rela-
tionship with Hemedti. In
addition to this, Hemedti
is supported by the
politicians who created
the infamous Janjaweed,
who were responsible
for instilling fear into the
residents of the Darfur
region of Sudan during
the major armed conflict
there in 2003.
The Russian Deputy
Ambassador Dmitry
Polyanskiy believed that
the proposed statement
was unbalanced, some-
thing they did not want
to promote as it could
“spoil the situation.” After
the failure of the Security
Council to reach a mutual
understanding, eight
European countries stated
that they condemned the
violent attacks in Sudan
by Sudanese security
services against civilians.
These countries included
Belgium, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Poland,
The Netherlands and
Sweden. In a joint state-
ment, they urged for an
agreed transfer of power
to a civilian government
as demanded by the
Sudanese people.
On 7th
June, Ethiopia’s
Prime Minister Abiy
Ahmed met representa-
tives of both sides in an
attempt to revive nego-
tiation between Sudan’s
ruling generals and
protest leaders. Protest
movement delegates who
met with Abiy Ahmed
included opposition
politician Mohamed
Esmat and a leader of
the Sudan People’s Lib-
eration Movement-North
(SPLM-N), Ismail Jalab.
Esmat was arrested soon
after the meeting and
Jalab was arrested from
his own home the follow-
ing morning. Sudanese
security forces did not
give any reason for these
arrests. Both arrested men
are leading members of
the Alliance for Freedom
and Change, a coalition
formed in January 2019
to bring together the
Sudanese opposition to al-
Bashir. They called for the
collapse of the al-Bashir
regime and a transition to
democracy under civilian
authority.
Awol Allo, an Africa
analyst, maintained that
Abiy Ahmed stands a
“much better chance” than
anyone else in bringing
Sudan’s military rulers
and protestors together to
find a consensual solution
to the current crisis. Abiy
is a young reformist
who was at the centre of
restoring diplomatic ties
between Ethiopia and rival
Eritrea. He has strong re-
lationships with the West,
which has aided political
reform in Ethiopia. Abiy
also has good relations
with powerful Gulf states,
such as Saudi Arabia,
that have influence over
Sudan’s military.
On 11th
June, the
TMC has demanded the
United Nations-African
Union Mission in Darfur
(UNAMID) to hand over
the remainder of their
bases directly to the RSF.
The RSF is primarily
composed of Janjaweed
militias, the very reason
why UNAMID exists to
protect tens of thousands
of civilians.
The African Union
(AU) and UN are con-
sidering withdrawing
all the remaining peace-
keepers from Darfur
by June 2020, with the
majority being removed
by December 2019. The
closed UNAMID bases
were meant to be handed
over to the government;
however, most of them
are actually being used
by the RSF. As stated by
Kumi Naidoo, Secretary
General of Amnesty
International, a decision
to close UNAMID would
place the lives of these
civilians at risk as it
would remove their “only
safeguard against the gov-
ernment’s scorched earth
campaign”. Indeed, on
11th
June, Hemedti’s Jan-
jaweed militias attacked
the towns of Dileijj and
Zalingei in Central Darfur
State. There is currently
no information on the
number of deaths and
injuries.
Sudan has long been
beset by conflict. It has
endured decades of civil
war, twenty years of US
sanctions and an Islamist
military dictatorship.
These current protests are
not simply over extortion-
ate bread prices or fuel
shortages. The Sudanese
people are choosing to
risk their lives, facing live
bullets, to fight for democ-
racy under a civilian-led
government. The number
of martyrs and injured
continues to grow, and the
situation in the hospitals is
dire.
I pray for the country
that has endured so much
hardship throughout its
history, the country where
most of my family still
live, the country where
many people have lost
loved ones to toxic gov-
ernment regimes and the
country that once had such
a bright future. I pray that
all hope is not lost. I pray
for a democratic Sudan.

On 4th
June, the SPAan-
nounced that a “complete
civil disobedience” and
an “open political strike”
would take place in all
workplaces in Sudan.
In a statement, the SPA
affirmed that the civil
disobedience will “end
only when a civilian gov-
ernment announces itself
in power on state televi-
sion.” They also encour-
aged activists to strictly
follow the techniques of
non-violent resistance in
their campaign of civil
disobedience against the
TMC. Protest leaders
have asked civilians to
remain at home, with
demonstrations being no
longer possible due to
the violent actions of the
military council. There
have been reports of
gunfire in Khartoum as
security forces remain
distributed throughout the
capital.
Also on 4th
June, China
blocked a bid at the
UN Security Council to
condemn the killing of ci-
vilians and issue an urgent
call from world powers to
put an immediate stop to
the violence. According
to Al Jazeera’s diplomatic
editor, James Bays, China
strongly objected to the
draft statement, saying
that it was an “internal
matter.” China was
backed by Russia, and
Kuwait said the “draft
needed amendments.”
