A
s his name
suggests, he
is a character
found in the
Game & Watch consoles.
These were the very first
handheld gaming devices
released by Nintendo way
back in 1980. A total of
59 different models of the
pioneering consoles were
developed each with its
own unique game. Mr.
Game & Watch was the
generic character of these
handhelds so he isn’t given
too much depth, however,
his many games inspired
his diverse moveset in
the Smash Bros. franchise
ever since Brawl. He is a
very lightweight charac-
ter, with average speed
and damage but with
many unique tools at his
disposal.
Most of Mr. Game
& Watch’s attacks have
a useful twist to them.
His throws, normal, tilt
attacks all have unique
hitboxes and animations.
His smash attacks are all
quite fast and powerful
especially the side- and
up-smash. In addition,
his down-smash can
root opponents on both
sides, extremely helpful
to secure a kill or start a
combo. In the air, all of
Game & Watch’s attacks
have a different property,
from his huge neutral-,
his exploding forward-,
his multi-hit back-, his
projectile up- and finally
to his spiking down-air.
All these particularities
become very useful in the
right situations.
Then comes his unique
specials. With his neu-
tral-B Chef, Mr Game &
Watch will throw slow
arcing projectiles to
stagger his opponents. His
side-special, Judge, is a
Russian roulette: Game
& Watch will take out a
hammer and a number
over his head which will
decide the effect of the
move if the hit connects.
It goes from 1, where
you take 10% yourself,
to 9, where you will flat
out kill the enemy, with
various properties such as
electrocuting, freezing or
healing in the middle. Mr.
Game & Watch’s up-B is
Fire, where he will jump
off a trampoline and glide
down with a parachute,
both a great horizontal
and vertical recovery tool.
Finally, his coolest and
most unique moved is his
down-special Oil Panic,
a bucket that will absorb
energy based projectiles
or reflect all others. Once
the bucket is filled, Mr.
Game & Watch will chuck
Today we are going back to the beginning of Nintendo’s videogame history with a character that embodies their
very first handheld console. He’s an oldie but a goldie, he is fighter #26 in the roster: Mr. Game & Watch.

Furthermore, I would
advise that you use Judge
to end a combo only when
your opponent is at a low
percentage, as with a bit
of luck you can land lucky
#9 and get an early kill.
In higher percentages,
however, a smash attack
is much more reliable to
end the stock.
With his unique arsenal,

to try out Mr. Game &

Due to his unreliable
