M i s c o n c e p t i o n s
Sir,
M a y I attempt to cor-
rect s o m e of t h e m i s c o n -
ceptions w h i c h J o c k
V e a l l s e e m s t o have
about t h e Christians
(members of ' G o d S o c ' )
in college. M r . V e a l l
seems t o b e under t h e
impression that w e are
mounting a n anti-Soc.
Soc. c a m p a i g n ; judging
by the w a y h e extolled
the beauties of s o c i a l i s m
in his letter (Felix, 20
N o v e m b e r ) .
The aims of christians
are not to promote a n y
political philosophy,
capitalist, c o m m u n i s t or
Otherwise, but to pro-
c l a i m J e s u s Christ i n a l l
areas of c o l l e g e life. In
the same w a y J e s u s h i m -
self w a s more concern-
e d about telling people
of G o d than ilea d i n g
them iin w a r against t h e
Romans, m u c h to the
di ^appointment o f t h e
J e w s .
In telling this m e s s a g e
the christian needs t o be
involved i n w h a t 'is going
on around h i m , o n e d o e s
not w a n t t o b e " s o
heavenly m i n d e d a s to
be no earthly u s e " . T h i s
entails playing a part, t o
a greater or lesser ex-
tent in the U n i o n , a n d
here one expresses one's
own ideas about w h a t is
best, whatever they m a y
be. I a m sure M r . V e a l l
w o u l d not discourage
such involvement.
Finally, I w o u l d like
to c o m m e n t o n M r .
Veall's rather l o n g w i n d -
ed a n d philosophical ar-
guments on m a n ' s b a s i c
rights. If h e Wishes t o
look at m a n in this pes-
simistic w a y , With n o
e c o n o m i c o r social rights
all right that is up to
him. There is o n e basic
right however, w h i c h
man has denied himself,
this is the right to eter-
nal life with h i s creator.
That m a n w a s created
with this right, that h e
lost it through offending
God, a n d that J e s u s died
so that m e n might regain
life i s what the christian
(who h a s rediscovered
this life) w i s h e s to pro-
c l a i m . A very positive
message.

Sir,
W e feel w e must pro-
test that hereuntofor n o
mention has appeared in
your erudite c o l u m n s o f
the newly formed K i d -
ney Turfoigo Society.
T h i s lis a s a d m i s d e -
meanour on your part,
and m u s t be remedied
immediately.
For t h e information of
your 'illustrious readers
the first seeds of this un-
precedented a m a l g a m a -
tion of kidney connois-
seurs w e r e soon in Basil
Street S W 3 o n Tuesday
last. After b u t t w o hours
it w a s a thriving organis-
ation of quadrophonic
dimensions.
To exemplify our as-
pirations, here i s a brief
synopsis of the Turfoigo-
ist manifesto: " . . . w e
shall n o t cease our bit-
ter struggle against
anti-Turbigoism, until the
delicious aroma of the
aforesaid savoury d e l i c -
a c y pervades every nook
a n d cranny i n the c i v i l i s -
ed w o r l d (and Neas-
d e n ) . "
A s for forthcoming
events, w e are currently
planning several w i n e
and Turbigo evenings, a
series of lectures, films
and d i s c u s s i o n s entitled
" T u r b i g o i s m Leads t h e
W a y " , a n d , of course,

N o w y o u h a v e g o t the
facts straight, w e antici-
pate your full support.

Talk by Mr. F. Briggs on The

Scene (with slides)
Tues. 4th Dec. 5.40 p.m.
M.E. 664 A l l welcome
Student Counsellor
After a fairly gentle run-in o n a t w o days a
week b a s i s I shall foe taking u p t h e post of Student
Counsellor fullJ
tlme from December 3 r d . This
s e e m s a s g o o d a t i m e as any therefore to take
advantage o f the Editor's invitation to introduce
myself through these c o l u m n s .
I h a v e just finished five years on the staff of t h e
Watford College of Technology Where besides
doing a certain amount o f teaching I developed
and ran a student c o u n s e l l i n g a n d welfare service.
I have w o r k e d i n t h e Hospital Service as a S o c i a l
W o r k e r a n d , for a p e r i o d , a s a n administrator,
a n d I graduated at the L.S.E. w h e r e I w a s a " m a t -
u r e " student from 1 9 6 1 — 6 6 . I a m married With
t w o small c h i l d r e n . S o m u c h for t h e 'biographical
details.
W h a t i s a Student Counsellor? Those of y o u
Who k n e w m y predecessor, Bonney Hartnett, Will
of course have a fair idea already, but for those
w h o d i d n ' t , a n d for first year students I s h o u l d
perhaps attempt s o m e sort o f definition because
it is far from self-evident. In t h e U . S . A . Student
Counselling h a s been b i g business for m a n y years
and s o m e large universities h a v e enormous C o u n -
selling centres staffed by upwards of twenty or
thirty counsellors, m o s t of W h o m w o u l d b e trained
psychologists or psychotherapists. In Britain the
development o f designated c o u n s e l l i n g services tin
tertiary education has been m u c h m o r e cautious
and remains very patchy. There i s no real concen-
sus a s t o w h a t " C o u n s e l l i n g " i s (even i n the
text books), b u t two broad truths are e v i d e n t : —
(a) There i s a g r o w i n g feeling In the educational
w o r l d that " C o u n s e l l i n g " services are a g o o d thing
to have, a n d (b) that Counsellors in this country
tend to take a m u c h more pragmatic approach than
their colleagues i n the U.S.A., for example, w o u l d
consider appropriate.
M y o w n stand is roughly this. Everyone i n c l u d -
ing students, have problems, difficulties and stresses
of o n e degree or another i n h i s or her personal
life. Nearly always w e either resolve them o r learn
to tolerate t h e m a s part of the normal fabric of
our lives, a n d t h e i d e a Of consulting a salaried
" h e l p e r " s i m p l y d o e s not occur to u s . W e rightly
keep things to ourselves, w e m i n d our o w n busi-
ness. Generally speaking, in other w o r d s , w e both
prefer a n d are able to cope With the contingencies
of life. It seems equally obvious however that there
are o c c a s i o n s When our emotional self-sufficiency,
at least for a time, breaks d o w n , a n d w e become
to s o m e extent dependent on the support of other
people. Bereavement is the most obvious a n d uni-
versal example o f such contingencies. T h e causes
of such debilitating emotional stress m a y of course
be m u c h less d r a m a t i c than that a n d m a y indeed
not foe very obvious at alii, b u t i t is precisely In
these circumstances that a counsellor m a y foe use-
ful. I d o not suggest for a m o m e n t that even i n
these c i r c u m s t a n c e s t h e C o u n s e l l o r is necessarily
the best or most appropriate person to turn to, but
he i s one of the people w h o m a y be able to help.
In a nutshell c o u n s e l l i n g Is centrally concerned
w i t h h e l p i n g students t o recognise a n d examine
problems w h i c h are giving rise to distress, a n d
possibly affecting their work, i n such a w a y that
they c a n deal w i t h it for themselves w i t h greater
confidence. It may involve meetings over a fairly
long period, or the contact m a y foe quite ephemeral.
There i s nothing mysterious, sinister or magical
about the process.
In practise of course 1 frequently see students
just o n c e — m a y b e to give s o m e information o r t »
suggest some more appropriate person. In a n y c a s e
the service i s strictly confidential.
If y o u w o u l d like to talk Ito m e my office lis at
the Student Health Centre, 1 4 Princes Gardens.
I a m available during normal office hours a n d c a n
be contacted direct o n Internal Number 4205;
through t h e C o l l e g e main switchboard Extension

I operate an appointment system but Will see any
student Without an appointment on a n y given d a y
if there i s s o m e urgency, though this m a y entail a
short wait.
