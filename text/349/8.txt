The demands given equal priority
are:
1) the abolition of discretionary
awards. 1 5 - 2 0 % of postgraduates,
many students at technical colleges
and those w h o change course or re-
peat a year at present receive no grant
at a l l .
2) T h e raising o f the main rates of
the grant to a realistic level c a l c u -
lated a c c o r d i n g to alteration in the
student cost index.
3) Parity for married w o m e n ' s
grants w i t h t h e full grant rate.
4) A n annual grants review.
5) A n e n d to all anomalies in the
grants s y s t e m .
6) the abolition of the means test.
7) Full grants for unmarried
mothers plus a full dependents allow-
ance.
8) Parity for postgraduates a n d
health service students w i t h the full
grant rate.
T o meet these d e m a n d s w i l l cost
an extra £323m. a c c o r d i n g to the
T . H . E . S .
W h i t e Paper o n Education
C a m p a i g n against W h i t e Paper
just as important a n d linked with
Grants C a m p a i g n .
The Government's provisions on
every aspect of education, nursery
education, teacher supply, teacher
education, secondary education, fur-
ther education, adult education, part
time education a n d higher education
were found to be totally inadequate.
The government proposes to cut back
student places from 8 3 5 , 0 0 0 to
7 5 0 , 0 0 0 in 1 9 8 1 . T h e introduction of
the D i p l o m a in Higher Education
w h i c h is a t w o year course is felt to
be a cheap form of education inferior
in results to an equal time spent at a
university degree course and unwant-
ed b y employers. T h e entrance re-
quirement of t w o A-Levels for entry
into B . E d , degrees are felt unfair and
discriminatory against w o r k i n g class
children w h o have not h a d great
emphasis placed on their a c a d e m i c
achievements.
A n a m e n d m e n t to blacklist a l l c o l -
leges offering the D i p . H E w a s de-
feated, as the d e c i s i o n lies with sixth
formers a n d not students, and there
d i d not seem to be a satisfactory w a y
of m o b i l i s i n g the schools as w e l l a s
colleges. A pupil desperate for a
place in higher education might not
be very co-operative in refusing a
chance to get a D i p . H E .
The m a i n decision taken w a s to
recognise that the W h i t e Paper c a m -
paign w a s just as important, if not
more s o , than the Grants C a m p a i g n
and that they should both be given
equal priority.
M i n e r s a n d Phase III
Our only speaker booed!
Conference c o n d e m n e d Phase III
for lowering the living standards of
the majority of the population and cur-
tailing w o r k i n g class rights of free
collective bargaining, a n d for serving
the interests of the monopolies, a n d
their allies, the tiny majority of the
population w h o o w n a n d control the
country's wealth. The only way o f de-
feating Phase III w a s seen to be
through united action of those w h o s e
interests it d a m a g e s , t h e w o r k i n g
class and its allies i n c l u d i n g the stu-
dent movement.
Conference therefore d e c i d e d to
pledge full support to the m i n e r s '
strike and help it in any way possible.
A n amendment proposed by Nor-
w o o d T e c h . pointed out that the
miners' struggle raised the question
of power a n d w a s not merely a test
of strength between the miners a n d
the Government.
Speakers, on behalf of the a m e n d -
ment, from the W o r k e r s Revolution-
ary Party warned continually of the
fact that the Tories w i l l not hesitate
to bring in troops a n d tanks d u e to
the e c o n o m i c crisis.
IC's only speaker A l a s d h a i r C a m p -
bell, supporting the amendment c l a i m -
ed that the Littlejohn affair w a s only
the tip of the iceberg of the Govern-
ment's undemocratic proceedings and

united campaign w i t h t h e miners for
the removal of t h e Tory government.

IC SQUAT IN 28 JAY MEWS
O n t h e afternoon o f last T h u r s d a y
a group of students from Imperial
CoMege, i n conjunction w i t h M a i d a
Hill Squatters, took over 28 J a y M e w s
— Which h a s been empty f o r 6
months w h i l e students a n d families
throughout London suffer c h r o n i c
homelessness and h i g h rents.
28 J a y M e w s — l i k e a number of
other dwellings in the same b l o c k — i s
empty because, it is believed, t h e
owner is speculating; hoping that by
getting vacant possession of the
w h o l e block it c o u l d be profitably
sold to Imperial College o r used for
other redevelopment.
Students today in London cannot
afford to live. Typically, rents are £9
p . w . — t h i s is impossible o n a grant
of £520 p.a.
Students cannot hope to reverse
the State's Tory educational policies
unless w e can prevent the implement-
ation of these policies.
A big factor in the chronic shortage
of student a c c o m m o d a t i o n in London
is the cut-back in Higher Education
expenditure, w h i c h means a c c o m -
modation is not built, subsidies are
cut s o college refectory prices go up,
and the real value of grants is re-
d u c e d .
In Essex University students are
continuing their occupation of the
University administration block. T o -
day there is a national demonstration
there in response to the call put out
at Margate NUS Conference to defend
that occupation. T h e squat of 2 8 J a y
M e w s is part of that solidarity action.
T h e Essex occupation is directly
against the cut-backs a n d their
effects in E s s e x — f o r instance they
are d e m a n d i n g firm guarantees that
catering a n d accommodation facilities
are expanded.
In Westminster at t h e moment 1
in 8 houses is empty. W e believe that
if the College Authorities are at a l l
serious in their suport for t h e grants
campaign they s h o u l d support this
squat a n d in conjunction w i t h West-
minster C o u n c i l make use of some of
these empty buildings for the housing
of students a n d families. There a r e
m o r e empty dwellings in Westminster
than h o m e l e s s people.
From this squat we ask the college
authorities to :
1. Negotiate w i t h t h e owners a n d
Westminster C o u n c i l to arrange per-
manent use of 2 8 J a y M e w s and other
empty dwellings in t h e block. T h i s to
be done b y a compulsory purchase
order if necessary.
2. P a y for repairs to and legal de-
fence of the building.
W e are approaching other squatting
groups, h o u s i n g groups, tenants' or-
ganisations, and Trade Unions to take
part in t h e w i d e r fight for decent
housing for all; a n d insist that the
homeless — students or families —
are not to blame for homelessness
therefore the authorities must b e
made to provide; a n d where they fail
to do so w e support its taking — its
real nationalisation—as w e are d o i n g .
STUDENTS DEMAND A LIVING
GRANT AND A DECENT PLACE TO
LIVE IN!
SOLIDARITY WITH ESSEX OCCU-
PATION — ROLL BACK THE CUTS
IN EDUCATION!
NO EVICTIONS I
HOUSING FOR ALL!
