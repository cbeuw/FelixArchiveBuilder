Match Report for 28th November
W i t h the w i n d h o w l -
ing a n d the first s n o w -
flakes falling over South
Kensington the l . C . Golf
Team h e a d e d for the
country h o p i n g to gain
s o m e respite. A s w e
drove towards N e w M a i -
den w e h a d hoped that
the Wind w o u l d slacken
and the s u n appear as
Tony B l a c k b u r n had i n -
dicated on the radio
o n l y that m o r n i n g . It d i d
not; 'in fact it became
worse. R i c h , driving his
Land-Rover as only he
can tried to c h e c k this
deterioration by cutting
d o w n dead-end lanes
and even heading back
to L o n d o n . A l a s ! it w a s
ail i n vain a n d by the
t i m e the Kingston Poly
captain greeted us at
M a i d e n G . C . our appe-
tite for competition h a d
b e c o m e sowewhat fro-
zen.
W h i l e the opposition
stood shivering o n the
1st tee the l . C . team
helped themselves to
some excellent ham
s a n d w i c h e s (with a n d
without mustard!) as
well as a few shots of
w h i s k y . G i v e Pemberton
was upset to discover
(hat the club possessed
no raw onions, k n o w i n g
full w e l l that his golfing
performance without
onions w o u l d be s i m i l a r
to Popeye's strength be-
haviour without s p i n a c h .
However the thought of
the c o l d afternoon await-
ing h i m soon cooled him
d o w n .
For tactical reasons
the captain insisted on
the team staying indoors
for at least half an hour
reasoning that the oppo-
sition's feet w o u l d toy
then be part of the local
pack ice. He w a s not
far w r o n g .
W a l k i n g out to the
first tee the captain de-
c i d e d he c o u l d not play
more than twelve holes
in s u c h conditions. He
w o u l d therefore have to
slaughter his opponent
quickly. T h i s he duly
did, ably a i d e d a n d
abetted b y h i s opponent
w h o , on finding himself
five d o w n after seven
holes, decided against a
c o m e b a c k a n d slid to an
eight a n d six defeat. T h i s
w h o l e match took little
over an hour a n d it w a s
not until a l m o s t an hour
later, w h i l s t the captain
was w a r m i n g his s o c k s
by the open fire in the
lounge, that the next of
the ' N o r d i c B r a v e s '
skated in. T h i s warrior
was none other than
new c a p M i k e S t r i c k l a n d
s h o w i n g a broad four
and three Victory smile,
a s m i l e that h e w a s u n -
able to alter until he h a d
poured a couple of
steaming hot cups of tea
d o w n his glacier-ridden
throat.
Darkness fell and the
resting competitors grew
anxious. W h e r e w a s
superstar Bill Calder-
w o o d , Richdrover B r o w n ,
Clive P e m b o n i o n a n d
R i c h a r d W a d d i l o v e ?
C o u l d they be lost? Our
fears faded as dinner
was served and soon we
did not care. It w a s
whilst in this pleasant
spirit that Bill (alias
God) c a m e i n , an ob-
vious victor by three a n d
two. ' D r o v e r ' B r o w n
followed h i m , having
halved his match. O l d
'Land R i c h ' h a d really
cut things fine, being
three d o w n with four to
play. S o o n after this
Richard W a d d i l o v e c a m e
in, an easy victor b y
three and two (repaying
the faith the committee
had had in selecting h i m .
This lad shows great
promise!)
W h e n dinner w a s over
we all sat b a c k and re-
laxed by d i s c u s s i n g the
'Energy C r i s i s ' in front
of a large electric heat-
er. W h i l s t in the process
of totting up the score
Bill n o t i c e d w e w e r e one
point short. It w a s then
that w e recalled that
C l i v e had not arrived in
yet. Immediately the t w o
sides d e c i d e d to send
out a search party. W h e n
all was organised M i k e
Strickland broke in
(looking out the w i n d o w
at the time) saying,
'Jeeze, it's still s n o w i n g
and looks d a m n e d c o l d ! '
The search party sat
d o w n again and w a i t e d .
On the stroke of five
C l i v e staggered in a
complete wreck. His golf
bag w a s frozen to h i s
back, his hair covered in
snow. Before he collaps-
e d , k n o c k i n g over my
w h i s k y as he d i d so (a
bad move) he muttered
through his sleet-infest-
ed jaw 'Lost!' P o u n c i n g
onto the frozen onion
eater w e nursed h i m
back to life w i t h injec-
tions of brandy. W h e n
he came to w e asked
him ' W h y the hell d i d
you stay out in the dark-
ness and c o l d if you
were g o i n g to l o s e ? ' It
was then that he ex-
pounded on how he was
one d o w n after seven-
teen holes a n d since his
opponent w a s clearly
losing his w a y in the
darkness he felt he
c o u l d tie the match at
the last hole. T h u s he
w h o p p e d his final drive
straight d o w n the m i d d l e
whilst his opponent put-
ted h i s w a y up the fair-
way, keeping the ball
clearly in sight. C l i v e
w a l k e d up to where his
ball s h o u l d have been
and d i d not see it.
Hence he had to oon-
cede the hole a n d match
to h i s no-good-son-of-
a-polygun opponent.
That G i v e ' s match
was anepic History w i l l
undoubtedly show. In-
deed, although the sea-
son is yet young I have
little doubt that w h e n
the historians c o m e to
review the season,
G i v e ' s match Will be re-
garded as his finest
hour. R i c h ' s h i s nearest
hour, and for the skipper
his coldest hour. T h e
match as a Whole w i l l
stand as a tribute to the
quality of guts m a n k i n d
in all its forms can de-
monstrate; even as stu-
dents.
Final Result: l.C. w o n
T e a m : Nigel Foster
( C a p t ) , Bill C a l d e r w o o d ,
Rich B r o w n , M i k e Strick-
land, G i v e Pemberton,
and R i c h a r d W a d d i l o v e
(this is h i s real name. In
previous editions of
' F e l i x ' his various aliases
have been u s e d for
security reasons — now
he is an established star
this is no longer neces-
sary).

WHICH WAY NOW?
CROSS COUNTRY CLUB REPORT
Last W e d n e s d a y , a
consortium of twelve
intrepid cross-country
runners set off for the
polar wastes of Potters
Bar in what can only be
termed 'a c o n g l o m e r a -
tion of o d d s and e n d s ' —
otherwise k n o w n as a n

proving that this contrap-

despite the fact that he
was flying around

the r i d i c u l o u s l y early
hour of 2 o'clock.

says he is w o r k i n g on a
centrally heated jock
strap as certain extremi-
ties tend to freeze up
w h e n it gets so c o l d .
The course was 5
miles of ploughed field,
numerous stiles a n d
barbed wire fences,
w o o d s a n d railway e m -
bankments, and anything
else you care to think
of. Unfortunately, the
s n o w obliterated many
of the flour markings,
and any number of con-
ferences were held to
decide w h i c h way to go,
and matters were not
helped When w o r k m e n
showed us the wrong
way. Rob A l l i n s o n , once
again, led l.C. home in
6th place, and w o u l d
have done even better
in Pad's wellies. Then
followed Ian Ellis in
12th place and Paul

become renowned in
athletic circles. Steve

ankle in one of the many
ploughed fields, ran in

who seems to be suffer-
ing more than most of
us, from a lack of train-
ing. A s h l e y Cooper was

M i k e W e l f o r d in 25th,
despite having numer-
ous stops to decide
whether we were lost.
The match officials
were just about to give
up hope of seeing the
rest of IC, presuming
them lost without trace,
when we saw the u n m i s -
takable sign of Pad's
golden locks fluttering in
the w i n d . A l o n g with
him were the Honorary
Football Officer, Rob
M a d d i s o n , and A n d y
Fairhead. Afterwards, as
if it weren't already
c o l d enough, w e w e r e
given a drink of ice-cold
shandy. Then back to
the changing rooms, and
a free five-minute de-
monstration by Rob M a d -
dison on how to dis-
mantle a shower unit.
After a good tea, we
returned to the Queen's
in rapid fashion, and
then the U n i o n , where
Rob A l l i n s o n emptied
his pockets of our
money, Keith A h l e r s in-
sisted on g o i n g to the
Boltons, and is n o w a
changed m a n . The meet-
ing was adjourned at an
u n k n o w n hour.
Injuries include Pete
J o h n s o n (bruised foot),
J . S. (Jockstrap?) Kali-
ray (weak excuse), Geoff
Spurr (bruised foot), G.
Imp (irreparable brain
damage), Dave H o w l -

with too m u c h work.
Neil Boag has been list-
ed a m i s s i n g person.
Dave Payne didn't ask
for a mention in Felix
this week, so he's not
getting one.

Stratford Competition
28th November
T h o s e members of the
I.C.G.A. w h o didn't
quite make the grade of
the first team also braved
the c o l d east w i n d a n d
the h o w l i n g blizzards of
W e d n e s d a y , November
28th. The scene was suit-
ably set, the course cov-
ered by ice-sheets, a n d
greens lacking flag-
sticks. Nine brave m e m -
bers turned out includ-
ing s u c h personalities as
Bev ( B . M . W . ) S m i t h ,
J u l e s (the hustler) D a n ,
A d r i a n (the money)
Evans, and Ron (can you
lend me a golf ball?)
Weatherall. Others i n -
c l u d e d T i m R o u n d , M i k e
(Mini) M a r x and How-
ard Rosser.
T h e Winner by 6
points was, surprise, sur-
p r i s e — J u l e s D a n , w h o
returned an 8 8 — p l a y i n g
6 strokes below his 'offi-
c i a l ' handicap. Joint
second w e r e T i m Round
and A d r i a n Evans, both
with 3 2 points — the
latter also scoring an 8 8 .
A l l available members
of the golf club are en-
couraged to turn up at
R . M . S . at about 13.00
hrs. on W e d n e s d a y s for
these Stableford compe-
titions. For a 10p en-
trance 'stake' w h i c h
goes into a 'pot' you
have the chance to re-
turn from the golf club
actually having m a d e a
profit! (winner takes a l l ) .
So far the record 'pot"
has been 8 0 p ! — surely
worth turning up for.
If you golfers turn up
at Civ. Eng. at 12.30 hrs.
on W e d n e s d a y s , there is
generally a g o o d c h a n c e
of transport b e i n g avail-
able (though no guaran-
tee of this can be given).
A n d now that J U L E S has
had his h a n d i c a p cut to
18 by a majority decision
of the Committee, every-
one has a chance of
w i n n i n g .
Canoe Club
Several days ago,
members of l.C. Canoe
C l u b took part in the
'Descent of the River
Exe' from above Tiverton
to Exeter, a gruelling 19
mile race with fearsome
r a p i d s ^ n d 10 large weirs
to be shot. The entry this
year was a record break-
ing 4 2 5 in all classes.
The 6 l.C. paddlers and
support crew joined the

other bunch started, also
going upstream, to d «

This was repeated about
8 times.
Despite several s w i m s
