This week Jock
Veall looks at
the historical
roots of religion:-
The key question w h i c h unfortunately A l a n Syrop
and M a u r i c e Moloney fail to grasp is what religion
is and h o w it arose.
Religion has evolved because man c o u l d not ex-
plain his actual relationship to nature so he finds
himself w i t h this fantastic force outside of his con-
t r o l — t h a t i s the fundamental contradiction between
man a n d nature, m a n wanting to control nature but
nature not wanting to be controlled by m a n . Hence
out of the actual social experience of h i s existing
level of consciousness m a n projects this fantastic
relationship w i t h supernatural beings because he
cannot understand his existing relationship w i t h
society a n d nature, i.e. R E L I G I O N IS F A L S E
C O N S C I O U S N E S S .
Religion gives consolation to individuals but
gives a false purpose to m a n w h e n the actual
material relations of society are not understood.
Hence religion does not have an independent exis-
tence from the rest of the social a n d e c o n o m i c
relations—that i s w h e n social relations change,
religious beliefs change. T h e rise of Christianity
with the fall of the R o m a n Empire, C a t h o l i c i s m
arose with feudalism (the marachical structure of
the catholic c h u r c h along w i t h its ideology reflect
the feudal social relations), protestantism arose
with the evolution of capitalism, Islam w i t h the
A s i a t i c m o d e of production, primitive religions in
India reflect the local tribal form of p r o d u c t i o n —
T H A T IS R E L I G I O N C O R R E S P O N D S T O S O C I A L
A N D E C O N O M I C C H A N G E .
T h e key to understanding the Arab-Israeli conflict
flows not from the religious differences (Jews have
lived in harmony w i t h the A r a b Palestinian for hun-
dreds of year), the religious differences only reflect
the conflicting e c o n o m i c interests in the M i d d l e
East particularly A m e r i c a and W e s t Europe's i n -
terest in " s a f e g u a r d i n g " their oil resources. In
Northern Ireland likewise the two religions reflect
material interests the Protestants having certain a d -
vantages over the Catholics see the d e m a n d for
civil rights as posing a threat to their meagre privi-
leges. Both A m e r i c a n imperialism in the M i d d l e
East and British imperialism in Ireland play on the
religious differences to encourage the deepening
of the d i v i s i o n s among the masses so that no real
threat is posed to their domination.
Religious practise is not 'a public expression of
a persons beliefs' (A. S y r o p ' s interpretation of re-
ligion) but an institution of the state i n imposing
the beliefs of the ruling class on the masses. Under
feudalism the aristocracy used the Catholic C h u r c h
to impose the beliefs of the aristocrats o n the pea-
sants and serfs. U n d e r c a p i t a l i s m the capitalist
class likewise use the c h u r c h (Protestant) to i m -
pose its beliefs on the w o r k i n g c l a s s , e.g. Calvin-
ism preaches that workers s h o u l d work harder (so
that the employers c a n make more profit). Hitler re-
cognised the role of the church very w e l l , one of
his first acts on c o m i n g to power w a s to streng-
then the hand of the church, so as to strengthen the
state in imposing the beliefs of the capitalist c l a s s
on the w o r k i n g class. Religion is used as the o p i u m
o f the m a s s e s — i t covers the chains that harness
the oppressed w i t h flowers. It is in this sense that
only private expression of religious beliefs s h o u l d
be a l l o w e d , religious institutions should be s m a s h e d
alongside all the other institutions of the bourgeois
state.
A s man gains an understanding of h i s relation-
ships to nature the need for religion is e r o d e d
away. After a socialist revolution he s h o u l d be able)
to practise his religion if he still feels the n e e d
but religion should not be used as a repressive i n -
stitution against the masses.
It is a pity that Syrop has to restort to mumfoo
jumbo rather than answer the question that if
M a u r i c e Maloney, A. Syrop, D. J a m e s and other
G o d S o c . people serious about the concern a n d
freedom then they w o u l d support the c a m p a i g n for
the release of Ivan Dzyuba and Vyacheslov C h o r -
nouil, two R u s i s a n socialists from prison. A m o n g s t
other c a m p a i g n s they should support w o u l d be
fight the fight againt r a c i s m and particularly against
the National Front. The conclusion w h i c h m u s t b e
drawn is their superficiality of their so called ' c o n -
c e r n ' for their fellow men. Even the c h u r c h conn-
m i s s i o n (an institution of the state w h i c h invests
the church's money in the property market) s h o w e d
w h o s e side it is on last w e e k w h e n it sent 2 5
bailiffs and 5 0 police round to their properties i n
Formosa Street, North Kensington and threw the
occupants into the street. The net result an extra
2 0 homeless.

launch new community bus
scheme: "no set hire charge"
Inter-Action Trust, the
Kentish T o w n c o m m u n i t y
arts group, has announ-
ced their latest project.
Another double-decker
bus will join the Trust's
fleet of buses w h i c h
bring resources to w h e r e
they are most n e e d e d in
the community. Inter-
A c t i o n ' s other buses i n -
clude the Fun Art Bus
and a pre-school play-
group bus.
The C o m m u n i t y Bus
Co. is the smallest fleet
in the country being just
one bus. Originally, the
name of the " c o m p a n y "
was to be the C a m d e n
C o m m u n i t y Bus Co.
After lengthy d i s c u s s i o n
members of Inter-Action
decided that w h i l s t it
w o u l d mainly be used
for C a m d e n Groups, it
should be available to
neighbouring boroughs
as w e l l . The w o r d
" C a m d e n " in the title
might have prevented
others from using it.
The bus is fitted w i t h
a sink unit, a toilet, a 3 0
gallon water tank, a
heater for stationary use
and shortly w i l l be fitted
with a 2 4 0 V mains unit.
At present it has seat-
ing for 7 4 adults, 4 4 up-
stairs and 3 0 d o w n -
stairs. Under certain
conditions, such as a
w e e k ' s booking, the
seats on the upper deck
may be taken out a n d
carpet fitted o n the floor
so that it may be used as
a room for sleeping, etc.
The mains unit w o u l d be
able to supply projectors,
T V , and various electro-
nic equipment that
people may w i s h to use
on or near the bus.
The bus w i l l be avail-
able to bona fide c o m -
munity groups, tenants
and residents associa-
tions and voluntary or-
ganisations. The project
is under the direction of
Tony J a m e s and Ted
Leyh w h o w i l l be hand-
ling requests at Inter-
A c t i o n . Groups w i l l be
able to use the bus for
trips, outings, and camp-
ing ventures. There is no
set hire charge, al-
though the Trust reckons
that donations w i l l be re-
quired to keep the bus
running.
Ed Berman, director
of Inter-Action, commen-
ted on the problem of
community transport:
" W e have h a d literally
hundreds of requests
from groups over the
years for transport faci-
lities. Previously we
c o u l d fulfil these re-
quests only occasionally,
because of our lack of
resources. Since this
new bus w a s donated,
w e hope it w i l l answer
a lot more of the need.
C o m m e r c i a l buses are
too expensive for c o m -
munity groups. Dona-
tions of about half the
c o m m e r c i a l costs w o u l d
enable us to run the bus
properly.
" W e hope that some-
day an action group
or federation of groups
in C a m d e n w i l l form to
take over the ownership
and responsibility of this
bus and others like it.
Then the c o m m u n i t y
w o u l d truly be providing
a lot of its own resources
and managing them dir-
ectly as w e l l . It is one of
our basic purposes to
have the bus and other
resources controlled by
a separate local manage-
ment committee w h i c h
brings together a lot of
g r o u p s . "
