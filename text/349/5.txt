NUS Conference, Margate, November 1973
'Students were " a b s o l u t e l y m a d "
to think rent strikes w o u l d force the
Government to pay higher grants,
Lord A n n a n , a senior member of the
university 'Chancellor's Committee
said yesterday'.

'The IC delegation had not really
got together before leaving for M a r -
gate a n d had no decided policy. The
small contribution made by our dele-
gation was not worth ithe £250
spent'.
N o r m a n Sayles
' W e w o n a £20 grant increase
W e w o n a £20 grant increase
W e w o n a £20 grant increase!'
N U S
Have a look at our list of delegates,
who are J o h n East, S o n i a Hochfel-
der, A l a s d h a i r C a m p b e l l , Alf Perry or
Trevor Phillips representative of
Imperial College opinion? Perhaps
Dave S i n c l a i r can be c o n s i d e r e d to
be the true representative of IC; I
never heard h i m come out strongly
on any point! The Delegation w a s
picked mainly f r o m the minority of
people who take an interest in U n i o n
affairs and make sure people hear
their left w i n g policies. However our
modest contribution itself helped
make up the silent majority at M a r -
gate. The atmosphere at the confer-
ence a n d the views put forward can
now be arrived at w i t h a little stretch
of the i m a g i n a t i o n . Attending the con-
ference a n d listening to the over
emotional speeches a n d debates, one
gets the impression that students are
ready to leave all a n d join in a mas-
sive uprising to 'destroy the unjust
capitalist s y s t e m a n d all its evils this
moment. One returns to College, im-
patiently awaiting the U n i o n General
meeting w h e n the results of four
days of hard work w i l l be put to the
college, only to find that the few Who
do turn up are not particularly im-
pressed b y What they are supposed to
have voted for! W a s it worth going
through all the d i s c u s s i o n s a n d mak-
ing a l l the resolutions? A s the N U S
never tire of saying, there was a £20
increase in grants last year!
Even accepting the fact that stu-
dents are not going to be w i l d l y
enthusiastic about what conference
decides, there is still something to be
said for ft. ft gives people a chance to
express their views freely and see
bow d e m o c r a c y does ndt work on a
large scale! After the real work has
been done by the c o m p o s i t i n g meet-
ings i n d e c i d i n g upon the form the
(motion and its a m e n d m e n t s are to
ta1<e nothing r e m a i n s to be done but
for the crude d e m a g o g u e s to polarize
the arguments completely a n d w h i p
up people's fears a n d emotions.
Napoleon's sheep then start bleating
and a d e c i s i o n i s m a d e depending on
how far the delegates' emotions have
been t o u c h e d . The conference tries
to be democratic in its procedure, but
is tangled up i n its own mesh of l a w s
and standing orders. Countless chal-
lenges are m a d e to the chair a n d
hours are spent sorting out the pro-
cedure. The longest wrangle at the
last conference took a Whole hour to
sort out. 1 w i l l give a short descrip-
tion of what happened.
1 Vote o n a certain amendment —
result close.
2 C o u n t — 3 4 1 for, 3 1 3 against.
3 Call for card vote (delegation vote
written on card).
4 C h a i r m a n ' s refusal.
5 C h a l l e n g e to chairman's ruling.
6 Vote on challenge close.
7 C o u n t : 2 2 9 for, 2 6 6 against, 7 ab-
stentions.
C h a i r m a n ' s ruling overruled.
8 (Card vote on amendment.
The Other challenges took anything
from 10 to 4 5 minutes to resolve a n d
1 have lost track of the number of
po'nts of order r a i s e d . W h e n confer-
ence d i d get d o w n to debating, the
time allowed for speeches was H to
2 m i n u t e s . There w a s no t i m e to
argue points logically, so the speakers
had t~> rely on the i m m e d i a t e emo-
tional appeal of their speeches a n d
usually r u n through the well repeated
policy of their particular party. Is it
democratic to get b o g g e d down in
bureaucracy and vote on motions
without having the time to d i s c u s s
them i n any detail, and what g o o d
are our ideal, democratic resolutions
if w e cannot enforce them? Perhaps
these conferences are the ideal train-
ing grounds for our future politicians
Who want to learn how decisions
should be m a d e !
Our Journey
If the IC delegation was not repre-
sentative of IC, it certainly was very
representative of our left w i n g groups!
In our little van w e had the most
militant m e m b e r s of the International
Marxist Group, the workers revolu-
tionary party, a n d the communist
party. It was inevitable that everyone
should try to m a k e h i s own opinion
heard, as the only opinion worthy of
the 4iC delegation and within a very
short time battles h a d been w a g e d
over a l l the burning topics. Needless
to say, no one changed his m i n d ,
learned anything or even listened very
carefully. Attention soon wandered to
two O-Level students, the delegates
from Paddington College of Further
Education, Who w e r e getting a lift
from us. They seemed to s h o w great
respect and awe for these important
sounding students and tried their best
to learn everything! Other more sens-
ible m e m b e r s of the delegation turn-
ed to the (two French institute girls in
the van. Piers Corbyn's neighbour was
soon Observed to b e snoring away,
while 'the other carried on with her
book. Fortunately for us N o r m didn't
pay m u c h attention to all the uproar,
and steadily d r o v e on to Margate.
O n c e at Margate everyone rushed
off to the compositing meetings on
the subject they were most interested
in. A compositing meeting is where
the real w o r k is done. Out of the
numerous m o t i o n s and a m e n d m e n t s ,
the most effective are selected a n d
the l i n e of attack d e c i d e d upon. The
exact w o r d i n g of amendments, the
best psychological t,me of day to
forward them and the proposers have
to b e d e c i d e d upon. Not be.ng a poli-
tical animal I c h o s e the gaysoc c o m -
positing m e e t n g . The great grievance
with g a y s o c seemed to be Steve
Parry's behaviour at the s u m m e r Fes-
tival of Youth in Berl.n. He h a d not
thought the cause of gaysoc relevant
to the delegation pol.cy, w a s alleged
to 'nave struck Peter Tatchell, the
gaysoc member, and torn h i s placard
saying ' G a y s o c supports s o c i a l i s m ' .
The great point to d e c i d e upon w a s
whether to censure Steve, ask for a
removal of his international respons-
ibilities, or h i s resignation. No one
seemed to be concerned with the
future of G a y s o c a n d (its develop-
ments. W e l l , as ' A l l ' said 'People w i l l
be bitchy I'
Conference began at 7.30 with
John Randall, the'President's address.
The f o l l o w i n g excerpt w i l l give a n
idea of John Randall's speech and his
conference.
" A s our c a m p a i g n gathers strength
we hear again the old cry that stu-
dents are a -privileged elite and should
be grateful for their pittance. This is
an argument that w e have encoun-
tered m a n y times in the past, but it
has a sinister undertone to it that i s
worthy of careful examination. If e d u -
cation i s seen as a privilege and not
as a right then what is the position
of those w h o do not form the elite
group, in a complex modern society
a major constraint upon democracy is
the inability of the ordinary person to
Challenge decisions of Government,
supposedly taken on highly technical
grounds, as w e l l as those decisions
that are raised in a more straight-
forward manner on basic political
principles. To deny access to educa-
tion to substantial sections of the
c o m m u n i t y is to negate the spirit of
democracy. But it i s not surprising
that this (Government is not greatly
interested in having an educated and
informed electorate. W e have seen
it raise council house rents, and c l a i m
to have done so in the interests of
tenants. W e have seen it c h a m p i o n
the cause of industrial democracy by
seeking to s m a s h the trade unions.
W e (have seen it c l a i m that rising
prices are part of a programme to
curb inflation. W e have heard it pro-
moting peace, w h i l s t selling arms to
Portugal. W e have seen it uphold
democracy by heading the rush to
recognise the fascist junta in Chile.
W e have heard it describe the big-
gest trade deficit in history as a prob-
lem of success and we have w a t c h e d
it expand education by s l o w i n g the
rate of growth. S u c h a Government
w o u l d hardly w i s h its electorate to
see its catalogue of hypocrisy for what
it is. To deny that education is a right
of all is to foster the myth of the i n -
fallible and omnipotent government
and i s to devalue a n d debase demo-
c r a c y " .
Reports and Frolics
After the address c a m e a lot of
boring events like M i n u t e s , Ratifica-
tion of P o l i c y , Reports, Announce-
ments, Business 'and 'more Reports.
I took the opportunity to go round to
the b a c k of the hall where all imag-
inable groups like liberal students,
Gaysoc, Palestinians, Greeks, Health
students, N U S and of course all fac-
tions of the left had stalls and w e r e
selling books a n d publications. One
c o u l d have arguments along any lines
with the attendants w h o s e e m e d to
have nothing better to do than de-
fend their beliefs. The bar w a s always
full and the coffee 'bar w a s kept busy
selling cups of coffee for Bp whenever
it w a s open. Given a choice 1 w o u l d
have spent all m y t i m e i n the compo-
siting meetings a n d w i t h the people
Who really got things done, but Nor-
man s e e m e d to think that a Felix re-
porter w h o did not attend the confer-
ence full time (9.00 a . m . — 1 2 noon)
was not worth his bread, so from then
on I spent m y time dutifully sitting
With N o r m (often w i t h all other dele-
gates elsewhere attending to th<
own interests) ticking the motic
and amendments as they were car-
ried, defeated or deleted.
A s conference d i d not end u n ^ l
midnight, all social activities had to
be postponed to the early hours of
the morning. The bar in our hotel was
packed until about 5 a.m. and the
board left meeting arranged on Fri-
day went on until 3. There was great
uproar over this meeting as the I M G
were not allowed, so Piers of course
tried to break in without m u c h suc-
cess. A door w a s torn down i n the
process I believe! D i s c o s a n d parties
were also arranged on all the nights.
On Sunday the hotel bar was taken
over completely by our overstrained,
drunk revolutionary friends. The
beauty of the expression on their
faces as they cried Revolution! Revo-
lution! could only be appreciated by
an outside observer as he fought h i s
way through t h e m ! The next morning
I w a s confronted by the havoc they
had caused. A l l the lace curtains h a d
been pulled down, and there w e r e
broken bottles a n d cigarette ends
everywhere.
Piers Corbyn I am t o l d slept on a
borrowed bed stuck halfway into a
cupboard. He invited six other of h i s
friends to share the hospitality of the
two original inhabitants of the r o o m !
Grants
The National U n i o n of Students has
called for a national rent strike from
January 1st in support of all d e m a n d s
in the grants c a m p a i g n . Negotiations
were c a l l e d futile and the N U S will
w i t h d r a w from talks w i t h the D.E.S.
after the first stage of the Triennial
Review procedure.
Unity of policy and action was tha
main point decided upon at the con-
ference. A national rent strike encour-
ages all colleges to participate, has
greater impact, a n d makes v i c t i m i s a -
tion difficult. The equal priority given
to all d e m a n d s ensures the involve-
ment of a large b o d y of students.
The disinterestedness of university
students in the discretionary awards,
the first d e m a n d in the grants c a m -
paign, was blamed for last year's fail-
ures. A motion of censure w a s passed
on the executive for their handling of
the campaign a n d for their lack of
leadership over the November 14
work in.
A l t h o u g h Imperial C o l l e g e w a s one
of the proposers of the grants motion,
it abstained over the vote because of
the call for a national rent strike. The
union policy of local action is appar-
ent from the way in w h i c h the deci-
sion over the rent strike has been left
to individual H a l l s and student
houses. Cont. on paqe 8

From time to time,
cars are abandoned o n
the College c a m p u s ,
where they rapidly be-
c o m e derelict and at-
tract the attentions of
persons w h o cannibalise
them for spare parts.
Eventually they are dis-
posed o f at considerable
cost to the C o l l e g e . Stu-
dents and staff are ask-
ed to co-operate by not
leaving their cars on the
car park unless author-
ised to do so. S h o u l d
they require any advice
