In 1948, Professor Laithwaite res-

essentially is a n unrolled a n d exten-

ties, by definition, a linear-motored

Politics
All i n d i c a t i o n s s h o w that remount-
ing interest in the r e s e a r c h pro-
g r a m m e may c a u s e a modified
Earith site to reopen. U n d e r the
p r e v i o u s s c h e m e , a three mile l o n g
test t r a c k w a s e n v i s a g e d , m o u n t i n g
a high flood b a n k at the latter stage
of the third mile. It w a s the sinking
of costly piles to support this incline
that s a p p e d so m u c h of the finance.
Now, b u i l d i n g only a s far as the b a s e
of the embankment, a t w o and a half
track is p l a n n e d for c o n s t r u c t i o n on
a greatly r e d u c e d budget. T h e s c a l e

a n c e of the v e h i c l e ' s p e r f o r m a n c e .
D u r i n g a visit prior to c l o s u r e , the
Minister of Transport, Mr. Peyton,

Train w a s further than T r a c k e d Hov-
ercraft, for it (the A P T ) c o n t a i n e d
seats. T h i s w a s either an off-the-cuff
c o m m e n t of an ill-informed a d m i n i s -
trator or that of a s h r e w d m a n ; Pro-
fessor Laithwaite's p h i l o s o p h y for
years has been that to sell a s c h e m e
you must take the part of a fairman
and give rides.
Inevitably, to sell the merits of the
system, Professor Laithwaite h a s
b e e n f o r c e d to enter the b o r d e r l a n d s
of politics, b e c o m i n g as he prefers
the term, a t e c h n i c a l " d i p l o m a t " . In
this role he h o p e s to a c h i e v e one of
three p o s s i b l e stages for future in-
vestment.
Firstly a n d at present the only
o p e r a b l e c h o i c e , is to sell patenting
rights to c o m p e t i n g investors a n d
live on the profits of the know-how
alone. Preferably a n d most likely,
Britain will m a n a g e to r e a c h the
p r o d u c t i o n stage of all rolling stock
but track c o n s t r u c t i o n will be under-
taken by a c o n s o r t i u m large e n o u g h
a n d with sufficient nerve to venture
raising the e n o r m o u s capital invest-
ment necessary. A l m o s t inevitably it
s e e m s this c o n s o r t i u m will be b a s e d
in G e r m a n y . Finally. British c o m m e r -
cial c o n c e r n s c o u l d be r e s p o n s i b l e
for c o n s t r u c t i o n of all stages of the
project t h o u g h this is almost certain
ly a non-starter for the r e a s o n s cited
in stage two.
Precipice

c l a s s e s into d e s p a i r a n d poverty..
Whilst the n e w m a c h i n e r y of the
nineteenth century p r o d u c e d the
hey-day of the cotton industry, c o m -
p l a c e n c y h a d set in c o n c e r n i n g any

ment.
A n d so, while contentment
reigned, the raw-material p r o d u c i n g
c o u n t r i e s simply built on b o r r o w e d

waite's view, B r i t a i n ' s t e c h n i c a l eff-

It w o u l d be tragic to see a n o t h e r i n -
dustry die in so s i m i l a r a m a n n e r

With this in m i n d , Professor Laith-
waite h a s i n c r e a s i n g l y c o m b i n e d his
a c a d e m i c role with that of t o w n
crier. In his o w n w o r d s , to tell the
