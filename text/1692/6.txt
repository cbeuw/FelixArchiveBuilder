The great Catalan paradox – why drawing
borders is not a solution

attempting to embrace openness while drawing new borders at the same time.

this as a creative form
of procrastination from
one of those endless
sessions in the library,
you probably still think
that a professional com-
mentator’s opinion on
the issue of Catalonia’s
independence is where
you would like to go if
you need a trustworthy
source to inform your own
confirmation biases. But
bear with me. I genuinely
think I have something to
say to say on the issue,
even if I’m trying to frame
it as a response to Aida’s
piece two weeks ago, in-
stead of as a long overdue
article on a subject which
the world outside of Spain
doesn’t really care about,
and which people inside
of Spain are more than
tired of seeing in the head-
lines over and over.
People love to draw
borders. Most people. We
find refuge in establishing
boundaries at all levels of
human social interaction,
from small families to
large countries. And it’s
easy to understand why. If
boundaries aren’t present,
clear, well-defined groups
cease to exist. Some
groups are more open than
others: the only barrier to
entry for the IC chess club,
for the sake of an example,
is being at least somewhat
enthusiastic about chess,
while the requirements to
enter my local golf club
are a bit more stringent:
you must personally know
a member and she has to
recommend you, which
basically means she’s
judged whether you’re
similar to the rest of the
members in a series of
constructed social attrib-
utes.
Even if you consider
yourself an open person,
you’re still drawing
boundaries with your
friends, as you’ll tend to
call and invite the people
you get on with —people
who share a similar set of
attributes or experiences
with you, whatever that
may be. And at a higher
level of resolution, bound-
aries between commu-
nities take the form of a
border between countries.
However arbitrary they
may seem, at least most of
them tend to reflect a very
old idea: that the experi-
ence of being French, for
example, seems to reflect
a different experience
to that of being Swiss or
German.
The new globalised
world offers a flipside to
our traditional love for
boundaries, manifested in
the form of megacities like
London, which embrace
what I like to call radical
openness: the absolute
absence of a barrier to
entry in terms of any
attribute —race, culture,
customs, you name it.
Step into the tube and
you’ll be surrounded by a
mix of people with hugely
varying conceptions of
the world, motivations on
how to act on it, and ways
in which their lives should
develop. Megacities are
interesting experiments of
what comes out of being
radically open.
And while I wouldn’t
have space to explain the
upsides of the existence
of megacities’ radical
openness, there’s a big
problem that a bounda-
ry-loving person would
point out. Cities like
London lack boundaries
and real borders, so their
definition becomes blurry.
There is no clear sense
of community and a lack
of definition of what this
group is or what it is
for. As a Londoner, you
cease to become part of
something and become an
anonymous individual in
a massive jungle. People
become lonely, focus
mostly on themselves,
and end up not knowing
the name of their next-
door neighbour. And it’s
understandable. If the
IC chess club suddenly
had a massive influx of
people to the point of a
fifty-fold increase in their
membership, but none of
them wanted anything to
do with chess, something
similar would happen.
Yes, the club would
become very powerful in
Union Council meetings,
but a sense of what the
clubisforwoulddiluteand
disappear. And probably
the members wouldn’t get
along as well.
It is important to un-
derstand boundaries and
openness in order to un-
derstand the Great Catalan
Paradox. Indeed, it’s hard
to think of anything more
paradoxical than what
the Catalans are trying to
do, which is to embrace
radical openness while
drawing new borders at
the same time. At a time
when political lines divide
along openness-closed-
ness (Brexit or EU, pro-
tectionism or globalism,
anti-immigration or
pro-immigration) much

“People love to

defined groups

“A true liberal
paradox:
drawing more
borders so
they can be
more open”
more than along tradi-
tional left and right-wing
politics, the Catalan issue
of independence seeks to
exist in a sort of quantum
superposition of both.
Barcelona has always
regarded itself, and been
regarded by others, as the
most open, liberal city in
Spain. A sort of Spanish
California. Its status as an
economic powerhouse has
turned it into a very cos-
mopolitan city. You can
find an immense cultural
exchange, an insanely rich
artistic scene, and a huge
variety of immigrants
from differing religions
and cultural backgrounds.
And it aims to be more
than that. At a time when
EU bureaucrats dream
of creating a European
Silicon Valley, Barcelona
is sometimes mentioned
as one of the potential
contenders. Contrast this
openness with the Cas-
tilian, closed, and mostly
uniform rest of Spain led
by conservative Madrid,
and an eventual conflict
might emerge.
And here it is. The
Great Paradox. Liberal
Barcelona trying to
approach more openness
by dividing us even more
than we are already. An
attempt to try to distance
itself from the closedness
and slightly backwards
image they have of Spain
(which, to be honest,
is a country that still
considers bullfighting an
elevated form of artistic
expression) by practicing
a liberal paradox: drawing
more borders so they can
be more open.
I, however, am no one
to decide how to solve
this inconsistency. This
is up to them. How to
embrace their own redef-
inition is not something
I can answer. But I have
Firstly, they should be
entitled to a three-round
referendum. One now,
one in three years and one
in six years. By doing this,
the Catalans will have
an opportunity to show
how deep their dividing
line is, and whether it’s
worth it or not. Having
three rounds will do two
things: it will ensure that
the heat of the moment
is taken away —making
sure it’s a vote about the
future of the country and
not just a protest vote on
a single issue (I’m looking
at you, Brexit)— and it
will ensure that it’s not
an economic issue. The
only thing that upset me
about Aida’s last week
article was the argument
that Catalans should have
a vote because Madrid has
been a terrible manager
of the economy since the
recession. This argument
is just plainly absurd.
Recessions happen all
the time, and if countries
broke up every time there
was one, there wouldn’t
be a country left that was
larger than the size of my
backyard.
And secondly, the type
of country Catalonia
wants to be should be
included in the referen-
dum. It shouldn’t just be
a simple “do you want
to be an independent
country” question, but
a vote on a new Catalan
constitution. Why?
Because the broadness of
political thinking that lies
within the independentist
movement is staggering.
This is something that
people tend to forget
when they erroneously
compare the Catalan issue
with the Scottish issue.
The Scottish independ-
ence movement is pretty
much led by a single
party, the SNP, which has
a clear social-democratic
agenda and clear views
on most policies. Contrast
this to the coalition and
supporting parties that
put Puigdemont into
power. It ranges from the
bourgeoisie conservative
PDeCAT all the way to the
anarchists from the CUP.
Can anyone even pretend
to predict what kind of
country would emerge out
of that? Clearly not. The
constitution must thus be
written before the vote is
taken.
I do have to say,
though, that although
I’m not a huge fan of the
independence movement,
I have a deep respect for
a politician willing to go
to jail for his ideas, such
as Puigdemont and other
Catalan leaders. I would
never even dream of a
character like that coming
out of the Oxbridge career
politicians that run the UK
or a Clinton-like figure in
the US. It shows that, at
least in some contexts,
idealists can still gain
power, in contrast with the
money and large corpora-
tion power dynamics that
engulfs politicians these
days.

should answer these ques-
