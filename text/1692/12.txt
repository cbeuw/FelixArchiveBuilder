The Felix Guide
to the
Hello, readers! For many of us, this is the most important time of the year – months of time
and effort culminate in our final two-hour shot to prove our dedication to our art. Of course,
I am talking about the Eurovision Song Contest! The iconic show, which has created massive
artists such as ABBA and Céline Dion, is back for its 63rd
year. The two semi-finals happened this
week and we have our final twenty-six countries who will compete for the title this Saturday in
the Atlice Arena in Lisbon, Portugal.
My name’s Shervin and I’ll be taking you through all the highlights of this year’s competition
including backstage gossip from the participants, all the controversies, what to look out for
during the performances, and some sprinklings of my own take on things here and there.
For the less educated amongst you who are wondering what Eurovision is, here’s some quick
background: in 1956, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was looking for ways to rebuild
war-torn Europe through‘light entertainment programmes’. The Eurovision Song Contest was
conceived and the first competition was held in Lugano, Switzerland that year. It was won by
Lys Assia (R.I.P.) from Switzerland with the song‘Refrain’. Since then, the contest has been held
every year, and now up to 43 countries compete every year.
Some may say that Eurovision has lost its original meaning, and is all about politics. I
disagree. The show is the biggest music event of the year, and unites many countries with
many cultures through the common music of language. So make sure you tune in 8pm
Saturday on BBC1 to watch all the whacky performances, exercise your professional music
opinion to comment on everyone’s vocals, and complain when Greece gives Cyprus 12 points.
And, most importantly, to feel the love <3
