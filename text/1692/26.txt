BELLY DANCING
SUMMER
WORKSHOP:
TRIBAL FUSION
During the summer
term, due to exams, the
Belly Dancing Society
pauses its regular class
timetable in favour of
one-off classes or work-
shops. This term we have
three workshops lined
up, the first off which is
happening next Thursday,
and will be in the modern
style of Tribal Fusion
Belly Dance.
Tribal Fusion Belly
Dance is a western belly
dance style originating in
SanFrancisco,USA,inthe
‘60s, which fuses middle
eastern belly dance with
elements of flamenco,
hip-hop, Kathak, Odissi,
and a variety of folkloric
dance styles from around
the world.
We’ve invited Alexis
Southall to London to
teach the foundations of
this fun and quirky belly
dance style; Alexis is an
internationally renowned
professional teacher and
performer of Fusion
Bellydance and Improvi-
sational Tribal Style (ITS)
based in Wolverhampton,
UK, and is known for
her unique style, flawless
musicality, precise tech-
nique, and dedicated and
engaging teaching.
During this class we
will work through the fun-
damental vocabulary and
movement approach of
Tribal Fusion bellydance.
Throughout the class you
will have the option to
increase the complexity
through travelling steps
and arm patterns, or to
concentrate on the base
movement, meaning this
class is suitable for any
experience level, includ-
ing complete beginners
to belly dancing! Tribal

Fusion is characterised by
fluidity contrasted with
precise isolations, and we
will cover both of these
approaches in class. We
will finish the class by
stringing this vocabulary
together into combina-
tions to get you really
dancing!

can’t make it but are still
interested in learning to
belly dance with us, we

came to learn from each
other. For many of us this
was our first international
seminar, and the first time
we would train and learn
from our overseas coun-
terparts. Shorinji Kempo
is designed to effectively
subdue any attacker with
minimal damage by
using acupressure and
the attacker’s momentum
against them. As a result,
the size of the attacker
should not matter when
it comes to self-defence,
and this was certainly
put to the test at the IKA
(International Kempo As-
sociation) seminar as indi-
viduals of all sizes trained
together. The acupressure
comes in helpful later too
as massage (seiho) is also
taught – helpful to soothe
the aching joints and
muscles of some of our
more senior kenshi.
As well as intense
training, international
seminars also provide an
opportunity for everyone
attending to socialise with
one another. This year,
Bristol Shorinji Kempo
arranged a suitably-Brit-
ish boat pub crawl around
the city Harbour on the
first night of the event, an
evening of seeing lions
and monkeys as well
as a dining and dancing
experience at Bristol zoo,
and a survivor’s party
on the final night. Other
highlights of the event
included learning from
chief instructors from
each country, the Taikai
(either single or group
demonstrations of a series
of techniques in front
of an audience), and the
fantastic boy-band style
dance moves from our
very own club secretary,
D.A. Williams.
The international
seminars are held every
year in a different partici-
pating country of the IKA,
with the previous seminar
taking place in Spain and
making the national news.
Shorinji Kempo is a
modern Japanese martial
art, where striking and
throwing techniques are
blended together seam-
lessly with meaningful
and practical philosophy.
It teaches self-confidence,
cooperation, and mutual
respect. Every week we
train in both hard methods
(punches, strikes and
kicks) and soft methods
(releases and throws),
eventually combining the
two into a beautiful and
dynamic system of martial
practice. Zen philosophy
underpins the training and
is essential for both mental
and physical growth.
As Shorinji Kempo
is non-competitive and
holistic, the aim of
practice is for everyone to
benefit, grow stronger and
learn the art of self-de-
fence. Particularly when
an hour-long “15-minute
walk” has turned your
tired captain angry, and
you’re next to a very tall
bridge.
