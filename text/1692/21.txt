The soul of hip-hop: why J. Cole’s status as a member
J. Cole is often seen as a musician overshadowed by
Drake and Kendrick Lamar, but with KOD, his latest
studio album, he shows why he’s a vital voice in modern
hip-hop.MusicwriterJordanBunkechartshisevolution
as an artist, and shows why nobody can dispute Cole’s
importance as a musician, or the relevance of his work
in today’s world.

Yeezus”
J
. Cole is a singularly
intriguing figure
in hip-hop. Over
the course of his
ten-year career, one can
observe significant growth
in almost every facet of
his psyche. Whether it is
his relationship with the
lifestyle he has dreamt of
for so many years, or his
musings on his identity
as a biracial black man in
America, Cole has been
on a journey towards
finding peace and content-
ment that can be tracked
through each of his five
studio albums. With his
latest release, KOD, Cole
has re-emerged from his
self-imposed exile from
public life, and instantly
made a splash only the
likes of Drake, Kendrick,
or Kanye could match in
hip-hop, all while making
an emphatic statement on
vices, addiction, and so-
ciety. While Cole’s music
has always included social
commentary – on topics
ranging from materialism
in black America in
‘Chaining Day’ on his
sophomore effort Born
Sinner to cultural appro-
priation on 2014 Forest
Hills Drive’s ‘Fire Squad’
– KOD feels like his
masterstroke. From top
to bottom, Cole sets out
with the purpose to start
a discourse that promotes
introspection, and the
execution is nothing short
of astonishing. With his
fifth album under his belt,
J. Cole may have finally
climbed out of the shadow
of Paula Abdul’s 1988
Billboard Hot 100 number
one smash hit ‘Straight
Up’. It was only included
on J. Cole’s debut album
Cole World: The Sideline
Story as a bonus track, and
Cole reminisces about his
apprehension on ‘Let Nas
Down’, citing the song as
a necessary evil because
the label would only give
him a release date with a
radio single. The fact that
J. Cole recorded ‘Let Nas
Down’ shows his integrity
and the truth in his art, re-
vealing a profound regret
at recording a song that
astronomically elevated
his profile and led to his
debut landing atop the
Billboard 200 albums
chart upon its release.
‘Let Nas Down’ was a
pivotal moment for Cole,
as it taught him to never
compromise his integrity
again.
J. Cole took a massive
gamble with his second
album, Born Sinner,
opting to change the
release date to coincide
with Kanye West’s Yeezus.
After all, Kanye’s status
as a hip-hop juggernaut
wasn’t cemented until
he famously thrashed the
seemingly indomitable 50
Cent in a sales battle in
2007. Yeezus did end up
outselling Born Sinner in
their first week, but only
by 30,000 copies – around
10%. Cole’s album
proved to have longer
legs, however, edging out
Kanye for the top spot on
the Billboard 200 chart in
the third sales week. After
this, J. Cole gained greater
artistic freedom. His third
and most acclaimed album
2014 Forest Hills Drive
was released in late 2014
without a promotional
single or any featured
artists and went on to be
certified 2x Platinum by
the RIAA in the United
States, signifying two
million sales. The album
was nominated for a Best
Rap Album Grammy
and spawned hits like
‘No Role Modelz’, ‘Wet
Dreamz’, and ‘G.O.M.D.’.
J. Cole decided to follow
a similar route for his next
effort, but 4 Your Eyez
Only failed to meet the
lofty standards set by its
predecessor in the eyes of
many fans and consumers.
It was around the release
of this record that J. Cole
quietly welcomed his first
child with his long-time
girlfriend-turned-wife.
The album was hardly
promoted, apart from a
documentary, and after a
few months spent away
from his life as a world-fa-
mous rapper, Cole leaned
on his die-hard fans and
still toured very well
despite his album’s lack of
impact.
And that brings us
to KOD. Since 4 Your
Eyez Only dropped on 9th
December 2016, all Cole
had put out is a handful of
carefully selected features
for the likes of Logic, Joey
Bada$$, Royce da 5’9’,
and his own Dreamville
artist Cozz. On 16th
April,
Cole simply tweeted:
“New album. KOD 4/20”.
Within hours, the hip-hop
section of the Internet
practically melted as
speculation began: What
does KOD stand for? Why
is Cole’s Instagram icon
just the colour purple?
Without a months-long
album rollout, a single, or
a stunt, Cole was relevant
again. He released the
album on 20th
April and
broke the single day
global streaming record
for an album on Apple
Music, with 64.5 million
streams, and the single
day US streaming record
on Spotify, with 36.6
million streams in the US.
While he will undoubted-
ly perform extremely well
commercially given the
way the album came out
of the gate, that it not why
this album is so important
to Cole’s status in hip-hop
and, ultimately, to his
legacy.

that his two juggernaut
contemporaries have cast
over him for years now.
One of the tracks that
best illustrates who J.
Cole is as a person is
‘Let Nas Down’, a record
that appeared on Born
Sinner. The track has Cole
recount the discovery
that Nas, one of his icons
throughout his youth
making beats and writing
raps in Fayetteville, North
Carolina, hated Cole’s
breakout single, ‘Work
Out’. It is clear that Cole
was conflicted about
‘Work Out’ well before
he learned that he had
disappointed one of his
idols. The song is a very
accessible radio single
geared towards a female
audience that has a catchy
hook and an interpolation
of rap’s elite trifecta can no longer be disputed
“Cole is an
evocative
storyteller
whose words
paint a vivid
image in the
mind of the
listener”
and J. Cole are often
pegged as the three kings
of the current generation
of hip-hop. All of them
came up in the late 2000s
and early 2010s, with
Drake making a splash on
the scene first and Cole
and Kendrick hot on his
heels. Each have released
a classic mixtape that has
helped lead to the near-in-
distinguishable difference
between mixtapes and
albums today: Drake’s
So Far Gone, Kendrick’s
Section.80, and Cole’s
Friday Night Lights.
However, over time, Cole
became the dark horse of
the trio. Kendrick’s good
kid, m.A.A.d city was a
critically lauded master-
piece that was celebrated
as the triumphant return
of west coast hip-hop.
It led to one of the most
infamous Grammy upsets
in recent memory: when
Macklemore and Ryan
Lewis’s The Heist edged
out G.K.M.C. for Best Rap
Album. His follow-up,
To Pimp A Butterfly, was
massively ambitious,
preaching pan-Africanism
and filled with 2Pac and
Jesus allegories. Kendrick
came out of the album as a
messianic, near-mythical
figure for hip-hop whose
reputation and status in
the game had exceeded
that of a mere mortal.
On the other hand,
on Spotify (until ‘Shape
of You’ happened, that
is). With Drake’s status
as arguably the biggest
name in the entire music
industry and Kendrick’s
status as the saviour of
rap, Cole appeared to be
a tier below them. He was
categorized as the middle
ground: possessing
elements of Kendrick’s
conscious music without
being a revolutionary;
being a hitmaker like
Drake without tailoring
much of his music
towards a mainstream
audience. Despite con-
sistently releasing quality
music, Cole was branded
as the boring everyman in
the middle of the hip-hop
spectrum who continu-
ously failed to seize his
potential and join his
generational peers among
the pantheon of hip-hop
legends.
That is no longer the
case. With KOD, Cole
has shown us exactly why
hip-hop needs him. The
album is conceptual, but
one doesn’t need multiple
degrees or hours spent
poring over forums to
fully decipher its contents
like a decent portion of
Kendrick’s recent work.
Cole’slyricsarepotent.He
is an evocative storyteller
whose words paint a vivid
image in the mind of the
listener as he transports
them through a myriad
of experiences with
nigh-cinematic prowess.
Whether it is his conver-
sation with a damaged
single mother groupie on
‘Is She Gon Pop’ from
Born Sinner, or his por-
trayal of a deceased father
leaving a message for his
daughter on the title track
of 4 Your Eyez Only, Cole
has shown time and again
that he is unparalleled in
this regard. However, this
has always been the case.
What sets KOD apart from
the rest of his discography
is the album’s potential
beyond music. Cole’s
releases have always been
substantive, with tracks
highlighting or toying
with social issues or
aspects of human frailty.
Before KOD, Cole has
never set out to make a
true concept album with
such cohesion and effec-
tiveness in its execution.
The theme of addiction in
its many forms is handled
in a manner that people
from all walks of life
can relate to. Cole does
not claim to have all the
answers to the issues that
he presents, but he still
presents some. The album
has already begun to
spark conversations about
infidelity, materialism, al-
coholism, drug abuse, the
tax system, and a range
of other issues. Great art
starts conversations, and
J. Cole is a great artist. For
several reasons, Drake
and Kendrick’s music
up to this point in their
respective careers has not
initiated conversations
with the socioeconomic
reach and openness that
this album has and will
continue to do. Whether
that is because Kendrick
is difficult to relate to
and not as accessible as J.
Cole, or whether Drake’s
image makes it hard for
him to tackle social issues
can be debated, but the
prevailing truth is that
J. Cole is a necessary
staple of the game. Drake,
Kendrick, and Cole have
been fittingly described as
the heart, mind, and soul
of hip-hop, respectively,
and each of them is a
critical component that
cannot be overlooked or
underestimated.

Drake continued to do
what he did best: produce
ear worm after ear worm
and hit after hit. After his
2015 commercial mixtape
If You’re Reading This
It’s Too Late, Drake had
achieved near-global
ubiquity. His fourth album
Views spawned ‘One
Dance’, his first Billboard
Hot 100 number 1 hit as a
