efore I started
at Imperial, I
was bracing
myself for
something more than
the regular anxieties
expected with coming to
a new University. I had
heard a lot about what to
anticipate: a deprecation
of any subject which is
not ‘hard-core science’,
confrontation because
someone enjoys taking
part in activities different
to the ‘status quo’, and
constant mockery of
medical students taking a
‘year off’ if they decided
to intercalate in a non-sci-
entific subject. I was
preparing for a struggle
with having to tell people
what I chose to study for
my intercalated degree:
a BSc in Humanities,
Philosophy and Law.
I am a medical student
normally studying at
the University of Edin-
burgh, but I wanted to
take a year away from
Medical Sciences and
delve into the culture
surrounding medicine
–my choice of degree
was perfect. Studying
at Imperial seemed a
fantastic experience, but
it has brought another
interesting element to my
intercalated year: being at
a predominantly science
university. The contrast
between Imperial and
Edinburgh is massive: Ed-
inburgh has students from
all different disciplines,
and – because the city is
a lot smaller – it is easy
for students to mix. Most
of my friends in Scotland
do not study medicine, let
alone any of the sciences.
This leads to a mutual un-
derstanding of all subjects
and an exposure to several
different disciplines
regardless of what you
study. This is not what
I have experienced at
Imperial– people tend to
stick within their cohort,
and lack the influence of
art students. Perhaps this
is why I have observed a
lot less acceptance of the
arts by the student body.
humans’ well-being.
This is especially salient
in today’s pressurised
society, in which mental
health issues are ubiqui-
tous.
Although the con-
ference was about the
benefits art has to health,
other scientific disciplines
have a lot to gain too.
Sculpture, for example,
can allow people to
improve dexterity and
see objects from different
perspectives. These are
critical skills for engineers
and medics. Scientific
research can also benefit
from the creativity art can
bring: when research is
explored through different
paradigms, scientists
approach problems in
novel ways, which can
bring superior results.
Furthermore, several
artistic activities – such
as exploring paintings,
reading literature… the
list is endless – help sci-
entists understand ideas
different to their own.
In a world where those
who study science will
be working with people
from all different disci-
plines, this is critically
important. Science profits
from the openness the
arts can bring, but there
are still people who don’t
think this, especially at
Imperial.
I’m not writing this
article to say Imperial
doesn’t encompass the
arts. In fact, I would say
the opposite: I was over-
whelmed by the number
of ways to get involved in
the arts , and I have seen
how the Imperial manage-
ment and staff are very
supportive of students
getting exposure to the
artistic world. There are
several ways to engage :
from the societies and art
groups available to join,
to the Imperial Horizons
programme which offer
more opportunities to
embrace the artistic world
than I thought possible.
Even the fact that I am
studying a degree in
Humanities, Philosophy,
and Law is a fantastic
example of how Imperial
has embraced the arts.
However, why do
studies, but some students
are still not embracing
this. What needs to happen
at the College is even
further integration of the
arts into sciences: perhaps
Imperial Horizons should
become a requisite for
every degree and not just
a select few? Or there
should be more mixing
between Imperial students
and those from other uni-
versities? Through means
of therapy, creativity, and
different ideas the arts
bring, they are beneficial
to our whole society.
Institutions like Imperial
should do all they can to
ensure engage with the
arts as well as their scien-
tific study. Maybe, if this
happens, the arts will stop
getting criticism they can
so undeservedly receive.

“The arts

engineers

some students decide
not to engage with the
arts? Is it the pressure of
workload, or the social ac-
ceptance of taking part in
extra-curricular activities?
Or is it that the arts are not
actually as accessible as I
think? My opinion of the
arts at Imperial is biased
– I am doing the first arts-
based course offered at
Imperial, and thus I have
greater exposure to what
is offered. I am certain
that my impression of
Imperial is skewed: the
friendships and networks
I have formed are based
in a shared appreciation
of the arts, mostly from
my intercalated degree.
It would be interesting to
hear the views of students
on other courses.

fantastic day filled with
important conversations,
workshops, and impres-

artistic groups working
