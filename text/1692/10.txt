failures, further lowering
one’s willpower and
lengthening the duration
of the therapy.
Before, solutions to
dealing with this problem
would involve visiting
more experienced thera-
pists, and carefully ana-
lysing similar case studies
from the therapist’s
behalf. In the Wearable
Technology Show, 2018,
bioengineers proposed
another solution – virtual
reality (VR).
Up until now, VR has
been closely associated
with video games. It
did take years for this
association to be made
due to the limitations of
the technology but, over
the past few years, top
technology companies
like Facebook and HTC
have invested billions of
dollars in hardware and
cemented this association.
As the technology for VR
has developed enough
to produce games that
engage gamers, scientists
questioned why it couldn’t
be used to engage patients

Virtual Reality – the
shift from gaming to
healthcare
Current therapy for
psychological phenomena
like anxiety, depression,
and addiction involves
going to a therapist on
a regular basis (maybe
once a week) and talking
with them about your
progress. They would
suggest treatment goals
and tips that could help
manage your problem
and you can try them out
during the week. Based on
your observations of your
mental state, you would
report back during your
next appointment on how
successful the tips were. It
could also involve medi-
cation. While this process
works for some people, it
doesn’t for others.
in a similar manner and
help them deal with their
psychological issues. The
idea behind VR therapy
VR, the patient can try out
different ways in which
they can cope with their
fear of spiders while being
exposed to one.
While some might
argue that the scenario
faced with theVR technol-
ogy is obviously fake and
that the computer graphics
aren’t realistic enough
to effectively simulate
real life, scientists argue
that this is actually the
greatest strength of
using VR technology for
therapy. Research shows
that the physiological
symptoms experienced by
the patient in response to
the VR scenario are just
like the ones experienced
in response to the same
scenario in real life. With
respect to the photoreal-
ism of the VR scenario,
research shows there is
no correlation between
photorealism and learning
transfer. Also, photoreal-
ism is commercially very
hard to achieve and takes
a lot of time and money.
Another drawback is that
patients would mistrust
the technology when they
know the scenario is fake
but is starting to look real,
which would hamper their
progress in the therapy.
While the VR technolo-
gy sounds like it is a good
fit for helping cope with
phobias, scientists don’t
want to stop there. Many
believe that the future
of VR technology lies
in other aspects such as
treatment for psychosis,
depression, drug addic-
tion and substance abuse.
This isn’t an exhaustive
list – there are many
other interesting uses of
it. VR technology offers
therapists and psycholo-
gists ways to experiment
with scenarios that can’t
otherwise be conducted
in clinics, due to ethical,
financial, or social limita-
tions.
One way scientists
propose to change a
typical therapy meeting
with VR is by introducing
the concept of Immersive
Therapy. This is a therapy
intervention rigorously
conducted over a day. The
patient is exposed to the
VR scenario for a certain
period of time. Then, they
discuss with the therapist
about possible coping
mechanisms and how suc-
cessful they were during
the time spent in VR.
After a period of relaxa-
tion, the patient and the
therapist reconvene to go
onto the next step. It is hy-
pothesized that this could
reduce the relapse rate, as
reflections on the success
of coping mechanisms are
done immediately, instead
of after a couple of days.

with their fear

An closer look at the future of wearables, reporting live from London’s ExCeL.
“VR
technology is
programmed
to make the

exposed”
“Up till
now, VR has
been closely
associated

games”
One of the problems
with this current approach
is that the time duration
between consecutive
appointments give op-
portunities for the client
to do nothing. Change is
scary and fraught with
uncertainty – it is hard
to accept the need for
therapy and harder to find
the willpower to stick
through the long process.
In many cases, suggested
strategies may prove to be
is that the VR technology
is programmed to display
situations that make the
patient feel exposed and
uncomfortable. These
are situations that one
normally wouldn’t put
themselves in but the fact
that it’s VR and not reality
provides a metaphorical
safety net for the patient.
A simple example of
this in practice: an arach-
nophobe might be exposed
to multiple spiders during
a therapy session using
VR technology. Using the
playable electric keyboard
embroidered into cloth
and controlling a toy car
with your brain waves,
to training firefighting
through VR goggles,
some of this technology
could find its way into
your life sooner or later.

egories exhibited were

While this article
mainly discussed the use
of VR technology in ther-
apies, it also has a possible
application in training
doctors. VR could be used
to teach clinical skills that
are tool-based, allowing
doctors to practice those
skills even when they
don’t have physical access
to those tools at that time.
The future of wear-
able technology:
Smarter and smarter
Google Glass was
criticized a lot for its
privacy concerns, and
smartwatches are only
uststarting to take off.
So where is the world
of wearable technology
heading towards?
The Wearable Tech-
nology show at ExCel
London in March attempt-
ed to answer that question.
With dozens of exhibitors
demonstrating advance-
ments in technology and
products, ranging from a
for greater comfort and
technology. Augmented
reality could show you the
specificlocationsthatneed
repairing, have someone
look through your eyes
and direct you, or display
circuit boards and instruc-
tion manuals through a
flippable display. These
are the applications being
developed by companies
such as Trivisio and
Realwear, who already
have a growing market in
the professional industry.
Meanwhile, Leicester-
shire Fire and Rescue
Service is working on
realistic training exer-
cises through a set of
VR goggles, gloves and
backpack you can wear.
“Smart” products have
been around for quite
some time, and if you
can think of a clothing/
traditional wearable, there
probably exists a “smart”
version of it with a whole
array of sensors and func-
tions built in. And not just
for you, but sensors on
pet and livestock collars
can allow monitoring of
their health and tracking
activity, for your dog or
a farmer checking on
his cows. The vitals of
whole football teams can
be transmitted live for a
coach to optimise training,
and soon you may be
able to pay contactless
through a NFC chip built
into...anything you want
really. A watch, ring,
or even fake fingernail.
These all already exist
but companies are devel-
oping the proper support
and payment protocols
to enable and expand
payment capability.
One particular wearable
is a light sensor to monitor
how light exposure is af-
fecting your sleep and life.
It was developed by LYS
technologies, founded by
Imperial graduate Christi-
na Petersen. After raising
over £50,000 on Kick-
starter, it is now available
for sale, and a newer
version of its sensor was
showcased at the show.
A good section of the
show was dedicated to
showcasing the tech-
nology and applications
of conductive fabric/
yarn. It would allow the
placing of thin electronics
and conduction through
clothing and remove the
need for external wires.
From fun applications
such as built-in lights
in dresses and heated
clothing, to flexible
sensors in socks, sleeves,
and shirts, there may be
challenges to consider
before mass-production,
such as washability and
durability in use.
Unless you already own
a few smart wearables,
and enjoy being an early
adopter of technology,
most of these products
fill niches that the usual
