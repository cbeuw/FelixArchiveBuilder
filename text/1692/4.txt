The campaign aims
to provide sexual
health services and
education to student
at Imperial.

T
wo students
in Imperial’s
Department of
Public Health
have started a Sexual
Health campaign to
provide sexual health
services and education
to Imperial students.
The campaign started
with the WE Innovate
program, in which MSc
Public Health students
Harumi Quezada
Yamamoto and Clara
Greiner decided to focus
on sexual health edu-
cation and access, after
noticing that the London
boroughs where Imperi-
al College has campuses
I
mperial secrets, a
popular Facebook
page on which stu-
dents could share
secrets anonymously,
was shut down last
week.
The page, which had
several thousand fol-
lowers, has been under
scrutiny for a large part of
its existence: in 2015 the
page was used to promote
Imperial Secrets Facebook page shut down
a “Jihad themed” orgy
resulting in the names of
four students – who had
bought tickets to the event
– to be viewable to all on
the Imperial Secrets page.
A meeting of Imperial
College Union’s Commu-
nity and Welfare Board
earlier this year had
voiced concerns about
the material posted and
how it was monitored.
Racist material and sexist
comments had been noted
by the Board. Imperial
College Union welfare
officers and the admins of
the page were to meet to
discuss these concerns.
Memeperial, the meme
page of Imperial College
London told Felix: "It's
obviously quite sad that
Secrets had shut down.
Memeperial aims to
provide humour to stu-
dents, but Secrets gave
everyone a voice. We're
not sure about the exact
circumstances that led
to its demise, but we do
know that it will be sorely
missed."
Paul Balaji, a final year
computing student, de-
scribed Imperial Secrets as
“like a forum”: "Anyone
could submit, and if it was
not outrageously offen-
sive, it would get posted.
Of course it's had its fair
share of controversy:
there'd be highly political
debates or people bring-
ing out freedom of speech
when something offensive
gets taken down. This
was all part of its charm,
in my opinion. It gave
more people the chance
to weigh in and provide
their opinions, contribute
to discussions, help others
and sometimes just bring
some banter to the tough
life at Imperial. I hope
somebody decides to
bring back Secrets as a
new page, it's honestly a
great way to take breaks
from revision. Oh well, at
least we still have Meme-
perial?"
clone pages have popped
up, such as Imperial
Secr3ts which has nearly
200 followers. The main
precursor of Imperial
Secrets, Imperial College
secrets – which has more
than 6,500 followers – is
still up.
Authorities across
the world are concerned
about such secret pages,
as reports of sexual
harassment, assault, or
suicidal tendencies cannot
be followed due to the
anonymous nature of these
pages. Two high school
student pages in Montana,
USA have been shut down
following demands by the
police based on evidence
of harassment and sexual-
ly explicit content.
also have some of the
highest STI rates in the
city. A survey organised
by the group found over
20% of respondents had
not been tested for any
major STIs.
The group has teamed
up with two clinics in
London, including the
Jefferiss Wing in St.
Mary’s hospital, in order
to provide both free STI
check-ups and take-home
testing kits to students.
Yamamoto states they
were able to set up
these clinics because all
Imperial students are
entitled to NHS services.
Additionally, the group
has set up campaign stalls
on the South Kensington
and Charing Cross cam-
puses in order to provide
information and spark
discussion on safe sex.
Yamamoto says that a
barrier to STI testing for
Imperial students is the
absence of an accessible
sexual health clinic on the
campus. In order to get
tested, students must first
book an appointment with
the Imperial Health Clinic,
and then, after attending
that appointment, make
another appointment with
a sexual health clinic
for testing – a lengthy
process, with bookings
sometimes taking weeks.
Most students do not have
the time or patience to
wait that long, and there-
fore ignore STI testing or
sexual health education.
The group also says
there is still stigma against
talks on sexual health at
the university. Out of the
114 students who took
the group’s survey on
sexual health, 33% said
they would not get tested
for STI’s if there were
testing services available
on campus, and 50% said
they are against or unsure
about making their partner
get tested.
Much of this stigma
comes from cultural and
family taboos of sex, and
the campaign wants to
normalize talk of sexual
health. Yamamoto told
Felix that thinking about
sexual health and safe
sex does not involve
just one person, but also
those with whom they are
sexually active, and it is
therefore imperative to
spread awareness as much
as they can around the
school.
The group hopes this
campaign is just the start
of empowering these types
of discussions at Imperial;
Yamamoto told Felix she
hopes “generations to
come continue pushing
for it to be something…
in Imperial’s agenda for
students.”
The campaign will
take place from 11:00 to
16:00 on Wednesday 23
May in rooms G23 and
G24 in the Sir Alexander
Fleming building, and on
Wednesday 16 May in in-
terview rooms A & B in the
Reynolds Building on the
Charing Cross campus.
STI testing is done on
each of these days, and
online booking through
their Facebook group is
required. Additionally,
St. Mary’s Hospital’s Jef-
feriss Wing will provide
take-home testing kits for
students throughout May.
