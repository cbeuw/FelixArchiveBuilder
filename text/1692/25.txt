Students on course for record exam results after
Imperial Secrets shuts down

Academic staff believe
the number of firsts
will rocket following
the closure of the
Imperial Secrets page.

I
mperial College
London students are
on track to achieve
record-breaking
exam results this
summer, following the
deletion of the Imperial
Secrets Facebook page.
Hangman has spoken to
a number of senior tutors,
from across all College
faculties, who believe
the removal of the page
will lead to exponentially
increased productivity
this exam season. In a
report delivered to the
Provost, academics from
the mathematics depart-
ment predicted the page’s
removal would increase
the rate of firsts by around
20% across the College.
One senior tutor, who
asked not to be named for
fear of an online backlash,
told Hangman: “this is
an unpopular opinion
among our students, but
I really feel like this will
benefit our students in the
long run. Now, instead
of spending their time
reading awful secrets from
guys about how unfair it
is that girls won’t sleep
with them, they’ll be able
to learn Schrödinger’s
Equation – only about two
years too late, but still…”
The removal of the
page, on which Imperial
students and staff could
post anonymous secrets
about their sad love
lives, was not welcomed
by everyone. Several
students reached out to
Hangman following the
page’s deletion, to express
their concerns. James
Buxton, a second-year
geophysics students, told
Hangman: “I’m just so
angry about the removal
of the page. I didn’t come
to university to learn crap
about rocks – I came here
to troll people on the
internet with literally no
consequences.”
Hangman also spoke
to some of the admins re-
sponsible for monitoring
the Imperial Secrets page,
and who were hit hard by
its deletion. “I graduated
last year,” one admin told
Hangman, “and the page
was really the only outlet
I had. My job in manage-
ment consulting makes
me feel hollow, and my
inability to perform basic
human interactions means
I have no social life to
speak of. Now we’ve been
zucced I just cry myself to
sleep each night alone on
my bed of money.”
Students were horrified after losing their means of procrastination // Imperial
comment, faculty denied
this. However, Patrick
Langley, Vice-Provost
(How Do You Do Fellow
Kids), thought it would
bring benefits: “At Impe-
rial, it’s important for us
that, alongside receiving
a world-class educational
experience, and helping
take part in ground-break-
ing research, our students
are able to pursue their
passions, whether that’s
handgliding, or chatting
shit on the internet. While
we regret the deletion of
the Imperial Secrets page,
we do believe it will allow
students to put their edu-
cation first by removing
a vital source of procras-
tination. If Memeperial is
zucced too, then we might
be on track for an 80%
first rate.”
“One student
told Hangman
‘I didn’t come
here to learn
about rocks, I
came to chat
shit on the
internet”
“Senior
tutors believe
removal of
the page will
lead to greatly
increased
productivity”

A
cademic staff
have begun
legal action
against the
College, saying closure
of the Queen’s Tower
Rooms (QTR) Restau-
rant for the summer
violates Imperial policy.
The lawsuit, which is
a class action, accuses
the College of “gross
negligence” in shutting
the QTR Restaurant,
which they say is a direct
breach of the College’s
Safe Space Policy. In a
statement for Hangman,
the plaintiffs said: “the
closure of the QTR Res-
taurant was frustrating,
but understandable.
However, the College then
decided to open up the
Senior Common Room
up to undergraduates.
This is a clear violation
of the College’s own Safe
Space Policy, and leaves
academics without a space
to escape students harass-
ing them about feedback
or past papers.”
One staff member, who
spoke to Hangman on the
condition of anonymity,
said: “the SCR was my
only real respite from
spending time with under-
graduates. I already have
to take vital time out of
my research to teach the
little shites, and now I’ve
got to spend my lunch
break with them too? Give
me a break.”
When asked for
comment, a representative
from the College said they
were “not at liberty to
discuss the case for legal
reasons, but really every-
one just needs to grow the
fuck up.”
Hangman has also been
made aware of a number
of postgraduate students
who are similarly upset
about the changes, with
one saying: “The one thing
I was most excited about
when I started my PhD
was the chance to finally
get into the SCR, and now
first years are allowed in?
It’s completely unfair.”
Imperial College Union
have said they are looking
into the complaints of their
postgraduate members.
Speaking to Hangman,
Kris Limery, Head of
Postgraduate Relations,
said: “Imperial College
Union take complaints of
our postgraduate members
extremely seriously. We
need to find out the extent
of this issue, and will
therefore be arranging a
survey in the next 6-12
months, which we will
then never report on.
Imperial College
Union’s survey on safe
spaces will maybe be
available in the near
future.

Academics demand ‘safe space’after SCR invaded by
undergraduate students
This week you take some
time off from revision,
and distract yourself
with something more
worthwhile: having huge
arguments within your
fracturing friendship
group over who’s going
to live together next year.
This week you decide
to do your bit for the
environment, and stop
picking up Felix each
week. Probably for the
best, it’s really going
downhill this term.
This week there’s no
farmer’s market, and you
essentially have no reason
to live any more.
This week you’re done
with exams! You’re
finally free to go back
to questioning your
life choices and being
miserable.
This week you and
literally 10,000 other
students decide to
converge on Queen’s
Lawn at lunchtime to lie
in the sun despite the fact
Hyde Park is right next
door what the fuck is
wrong with you.
This week Imperial
Secrets gets shut down –
you didn’t know that one
you submitted about your
sexual fantasies would be
so controversial.
This week’s weather
means you’re so
dehydrated you don’t
even have enough fluid
left to cry.
This week you fall asleep
in the sun, and the next
day your whole body is
burnt and peeling. Does
this count as mitigating
circumstances?
This week the fear
prompted by Trump
potentially cancelling
the Iran nuclear deal
is tempered by the
fact we’re one step
closer to sweet nuclear
armageddon.
This week you’ve only
got two weeks to go
until exams – better
stop repeatedly making
revision timetables and
actually do some fucking
work.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you can’t figure out how
to fit in a gag about the
council elections. I’M
SORRY I’M TRYING
OK!!!
