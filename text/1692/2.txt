Success for Imperial graduates in last week's local
elections
NEWS
Leo Cassarani and
Sina Lari were both
made councillors for
the Labour Party in
last week's elections.

Deputy Editor
T
wo Imperial
graduates have
taken seats on
London coun-
cils in this month’s local
elections.
Sina Lari and Leo
Cassarani – both of whom
stood as Labour Party
candidates – won seats in
the wards of Golborne and
Swiss Cottage respective-
ly.
Lari, a recent biology
graduate and vice-chair
of the Kensington Labour
Party, joins Emma Dent
Coad and Pat Mason. The
three Labour councillors
took more than 75% of the
vote share.
“I was very humbled to
have won with over 75%
of the vote,” Lari said.
“The position comes with
great responsibility and it
is my duty to work closely
with residents over the
next four years to achieve
change.”
In addition to his in-
volvement with the Kens-
ington Labour Party, Lari
sits on the executive com-
mittee of campaign group
Scientists for Labour, and
is a grassroots campaigner
in the community.
Lari said: “One of my
biggest priorities will be
to stop the ongoing social
cleansing in Kensington.
Residents are being priced
out of their homes and
the Borough in favour of
luxury development; no
graduate can afford to live
here anymore.”
Science and education
are also high on Lari’s list.
“I have been involved
in the campaign to save
Kensington and Chelsea
College from plans to
have it shut down and
turned into flats.
“I want to promote
Kensington and Chelsea
as a ‘science borough’
in the wake of Brexit. I
helped draft a successful
motion this year to set
up a European Citizens’
Advisory Service to help
those affected by the
ongoing shambolic Brexit
saga,” he added.
In Swiss Cottage, com-
puting graduate Cassarani
was elected alongside
fellow Labour candidates
Nayra Bello O’Shanahan
and Simon Pearson.
Combined, the trio won
almost half of the votes
in the ward. Their success
marks the end of a 20 year
stretch in which Swiss
Cottage had no Labour
councillors.
SpeakingtotheCamden
New Journal, Cassarani
said: “The residents of
Swiss Cottage are sick of
being taken for granted by
the Tories. They’ve had
the same local councillors
for almost 20 years and
I think they wanted a
change.”
Cassarani chalks the
success of the Camden
Labour Party up to its
“incredible grassroots
campaign”.
“Our top priority was
to speak to as many local
residents as possible; by
the end of our campaign
80% of local residents
had spoken to a Labour
canvasser,” Cassarani
told Felix. “The national
Labour Party said we had
the highest contact rate in
the country.”
He added: “We were
hugely outspent by our
opponents [the Conserv-
atives] who flooded the
area with leaflets, direct
mailings, attack letters,
manifestos...but we con-
tinued to focus on local
residents and the issues
that worried them.
“The best part was
the number of residents
who told us they voted
Labour for the first time
because they had seen the
difference a grassroots,
community-based ap-
proach can make in local
government.”
Labour gained nine seats
from the Conservatives;
Labour now has 35 coun-
cillors in Hammersmith
and Fulham compared to
eleven for the Conserva-
tives.
An analysis before last
year’s general election for
London Student suggests
turnout among Imperial
students can swing results
in Labour’s favour,
particularly in marginal
seats. It is unclear if this
was a factor in the local
elections, where turnout
is typically lower than
that of general elections.
Many students eligible to
vote do not do so in their
university constituency,
choosing either to vote in
their home constituency
or not at all.
Elsewhere in the
country Labour emerged
as the single largest party,
picking up 79 seats to
take its total to 2,350. The
Conservatives have 1,332
seats – a loss of 35. The
Liberal Democrats and
Green Party both gained
seats while the UKIP vote
all but collapsed, leaving
it with three seats.

Labour”
“Leo Cassarani
chalks the
success of
the Camden
Labour
Party to an
'incredible
grassroots
campaign”
Labour also did well
in the wards of Ham-
mersmith and Fulham
– a borough which, like
Kensington and Chelsea,
counts a significant
number of Imperial stu-
dents as constituents.
Following the Grenfell
Tower fire last June, which
saw 71 residents dead and
many more forced to leave
their homes, housing and
regeneration have been at
the forefront of campaigns
in Kensington.

It's not easy being green…
Another week, another
issue. As we get closer
and closer to the end of
term, I’m equally sad
about finishing my term as
Editor, and a bit relieved
I won’t have to spend
my Thursday evenings
in a cold sweat, rushing
against a print deadline,
and churning out another
logorrheic spew of an
editorial. One aspect of
my editorship that I hadn’t
really expected was how
finding out what’s going
on around College can be
both exciting and exasper-
ating – this week’s cover
story, about the Greening
Imperial report perfectly
encapsulates this divide.
We first heard about the
Greening Imperial initia-
tive way back in October
time, when I was still a
fresh-faced baby editor,
rather than the grizzled
husk you have now. I got
in touch with one of the
organisers, Dan, and we
met for a coffee to chat
about the project. We
were both super excited
about the initiative, which
would take a look at how
Imperial is currently
working on sustainability,
the environment, and
climate change, as well
as what they could do to
improve.
As time went on, things
got a bit delayed, as these
big projects often do, but
now the report has finally
been released – hooray!
Here at Felix, we spent
our weekend reading and
digesting the full 100 page
beast, so you wouldn’t
have to. And here’s where
the exciting/exasperating
bit comes in: it’s really
exciting that such a project
is going forward, and that
the team were able to lay
out a series of structured,
sensible ideas for how to
make sure Imperial is one
of the leading lights in
environmentalism – not
only within the university
sector, but across all areas.
However, what’s exas-
perating is how little has
been done so far. Despite
all the research into
sustainability and climate
change that academics
at Imperial are sending
out across the world,
when it comes to our own
practices, we desperately
need to get our house in
order. 141st
in the People
and Planet League Tables.
An increase in greenhouse
gas emissions since 2009.
A spike in electricity
usage by 15% over four
years. Continued use of
plastic cutlery and cups,
despite the damage this
waste can have on the
oceans. Investing millions
in fossil fuel companies.
The list, unfortunately,
goes on.
It’s shocking that, for a
university that prides itself
on its excellent scientific
practice, we’re not paying
attention to the myriad of
scientific experts telling us
what needs to be done to
have a chance of delaying
the major catastrophic
effects of global warming.
It’s shameful that, while
we have incredible people
at the Grantham and the
Centre for Environmental
Policy working to try
and save our planet, as a
whole we’re hastening its
demise.
But while the Greening
Imperial report is a good
start to fixing some of
these issues, it’s not a
silver bullet. It now needs
to go through planning
stages; people in the Blue
Cube need to approve
the changes, and all of us
across the campus need to
pitch in to help. And that’s
where you and I come in.
These changes won’t be
made unless we demand
them, keeping up pressure
on the College and holding
them to account.
Changing the world
needs to start somewhere.
Please recycle this Felix.
