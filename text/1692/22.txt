Lean on Pete: Transmissions from the Interior West
W
hat is a
We s t e r n ?
W h i l e
everybody
might know a film is a
Western when they watch
it, the actual definition
is – as with any attempt to
define cultural movements
– difficult to pin down,
squirming and wriggling
away like a slippery
eel. The American Film
Institute has defined the
Western as films “set in
the American West that
embody the spirit, the
struggle and the demise
of the new frontier” – a
classification that fails to
take into account the work
of Japanese directors like
Kurosawa, or subgenres
like the post-apocalyptic
western.
However, within this
definition is a kernel of
truth: a western must deal
with characters facing up
against a harsh landscape,
upon which they stake
their claim.
In that respect, Lean
on Pete, the latest film
from British director
Andrew Haigh, is most
certainly a Western. At its
centre is Charley (Charlie
Plummer), a 15-year-old
living in Portland with his
father; abandoned by his
mother, and essentially
left to raise himself by
his father, Charlie begins
working for Del (Steve
Buscemi), a cynical
horse-racer whose
horizons are dwindling.
After he finds out his
favourite horse, Lean on
Pete, is bound for the glue
factory, he ‘liberates’ the
animal, and the two begin
their epic journey across
America.
The shift into a Western
is a surprise for Haigh. His
breakout film, Weekend,
focussed on the first 48
hours in the relationship
between two men in
Nottingham; introspective
and humanistic, it resem-
bled some of the best work
by Richard Linklater, and
became a landmark drama
within queer cinema. His
on Pete, however, due
to its narrative structure,
consists of not so much
a dialogue, but rather a
soliloquy from Charley,
delivered to the horse and
the land and the sky. It’s
a risk by Haigh, one that
leaves relative newcomer
Plummer the chance of
being over-exposed; while
this vulnerability is the
desired effect, there was
no guarantee that it would
be the outcome. Luckily,
for both Haigh and the
audience, it works.
Buscemi is similarly
brilliantly wry and bitter
as Del, and he is ably
supported by Chloe
Sevigny, who appears as
a burnt-out jockey, whose
career has been marked by
a series of injuries. While
it might be surprising to
see two actors so associ-
ated with New York be
transplanted to Oregon,
but both manage to make
their characters feel real
and lived-in.
The film belongs,
however, to Plummer. At
only18,theassurancewith
which he handles his dif-
ficult role is exceptional;
despite facing on extreme
hardships, Plummer never
allows the audience to
forget that, underneath it
all, his character is still
essentially a child, one
who will struggle to deal
with his experiences once
the credits roll. Haigh,
similarly, who adapted
the script from a novel by
Willy Vlautin, highlights
the harsh nature of the
American wilderness,
centring on the bleak,
inhospitable, beautiful
terrain.
The imagery used in
Haigh’s films have been
undergoing a period of
transformation from the
intimate to the expansive;
like the Eames’ Power
of Ten, Haigh has been
slowly pulling away,
moving away from close-
ups into a more monu-
mental exploration of
nature. Weekend, filmed
pulls out dramatically, in
an exuberant celebration
of the Interior West. The
boy and his horse become
small figures, crushed
between the twin horizon-
tals of sky and land – two
limitless expanses that are
simultaneously freeing
and oppressive.
Despite a slight bag-
giness to the film, which
could have been edited
down slightly, particularly
towards the end, Lean on
Pete marks three for three
for Haigh, who is able
to bring his humanistic
film-making to any genre.
Lean on Pete will evoke
comparisons to the work
ofKellyReichardt–Haigh
is as adept as Reichardt
at capturing the twin
loneliness and freedom
of the natural world – but
as Haigh continues his
directorial journey, it’s
exciting to see where he
might land next.
Andrew Haigh’s latest release is a new direction for the filmmaker, but sees him expanding his horizons for a
modern-day western.

LEAN ON PETE
“The shift
into Western
is a surprise
for Haigh,
following his
previous work”
follow-up, 45 Years took
the opposite approach to
relationships and time,
with Tom Courtenay
and Charlotte Rampling
playing a couple about
to celebrate their 45th
wedding anniversary,
whose lives are disrupted
by the emergence of a
hidden secret. With Lean
on Pete, a much more
sprawling work, in a com-
pletely different setting,
Haigh is setting himself a
challenge.
While Haigh’s last two
films have focussed on
the relationships between
individuals, and the
intimacy that can develop
– both over hours and
years. Central to his work
is what his characters say –
or, in the case of 45 Years,
what is left unsaid. Lean
“The imagery
in Haigh’s
films have
undergone a
transformation
from intimate
to expansive”
mostly within cramped
confines of flats and cars
and clubs and buses, was
a study of interiors. In
45 Years, meanwhile,
the domestic interior of
the couple’s house was
juxtaposed against the
flat, misted landscapes of
Norfolk – as evocative
as any Yorkshire moor.
