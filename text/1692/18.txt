Clash of Cultures: Giskin Day
Giskin Day is a Principal teaching fellow and course lead for the intercalated BSc in Medical Sciences with
Humanities, Philosophy, and Law. She sat down with Felix’s Editor-in-Chief, Fred Fyles, to discuss her career,
course, and the importance of creativity in science.

past the main entrance
of the Centre for
Languages, Culture, and
Communication, on the
third floor of Sherfield,
it has been overrun with
an array of padlocked
backpacks. They’re being
stored there in preparation
of the Imperial Festival,
which ran the weekend
after I spoke to her, and
for which she’d helped
students to design an
escape-room-in-a-bag
challenge. Educational
escape rooms, which help
develop teamwork, com-
munication, and lateral
thinking, are just one ex-
ample of how she brings
a sense of creativity and
excitement to Imperial.
As one of the course leads
for the newly-created in-
tercalated BSc in Medical
Sciences with Humanities,
Philosophy, and Law,
she’s more than qualified
to talk about how to break
down the barriers between
art and science.
Fred: Can you tell us
about the intercalated
BSc you’ve been running
this year?
Giskin: Medical Hu-
manities is actually not
new at Imperial; we’ve
run a course for about 15
years, as part of a BSc. But
this is the first year we’ve
taken the plunge and
offered a full intercalated
BSc in Humanities, Phi-
losophy, and Law. We’ve
merged with another
short course called Death,
Autopsy, and Law and
the course is wonderfully
interdisciplinary. I think
it differs from other types
of intercalated BSc, in
that ours is bespoke for
our students. We’re not
sending students off to ‘sit
in on’ other courses the
way they often do in other
medical schools. We’ve
really thought about
what our students like to
do – and what they need
to do – and we’ve themed
the course around that. So,
we’ve had one module on
the body, one on the mind,
and one on death and
dying, and then students
have the choice to do a
project for which there is
an art component.
Throughout the course
every week there is a field
trip; we’ve been to lots of
galleries, we’ve also been
to the law courts, we’ve
been to museums. We’ve
worked in partnership
with the Chelsea Physic
Garden to learn about the
history of pharmaceuti-
cals, and we’ve had a lot
of wonderful workshops
with practising artists who
are inspired by medicine
our mantra is: you don’t
have to be artistic to do
the course, it’s all about
creativity and giving it
a go; the process is far
more important than the
product.
F: What do you
think the benefits are in
engaging with the arts,
particularly in scientific
practice? What does it
bring?
G: I like to use the
analogy of Exhibition
Road: it used to be a
traditional road with the
traffic going two ways
and a small pavement,
but of course now there’s
a huge amount of uncer-
tainty. They’ve removed
the boundary between the
pavement and the road
and it feels like there’s a
lot happening on there,
bicycles, coaches and
everything – huge amount
of ambiguity. As a result,
you’d think it would be
dangerous, but actually
it makes it safer. People
have to communicate their
intentions. The traffic
slows down and drivers
are more attentive because
unpredictable things
happen. What science
often gives the impression
of doing is beating the
uncertainty out of things,
but unless you can handle
uncertainty, you’re in
real trouble, especially if
you’re going to practise
as a doctor. The arts have
never that reputation: they
have always been ambig-
uous. There’s famously no
one right answer. I think
engaging in the arts is like
walking down Exhibition
Road: you’ve got to com-
municate, you’ve got to
make eye contact, you’ve
got to make reasoned
judgements. These are all
good skills in medicine.
When you’re working
in real life, you rarely
have all the data to hand,
there’s rarely one right
answer. So the BSc is a
wonderful safe space of

F: And what’s the
reaction been like from
the students on the
course?
G: Well, naturally, the
students who choose our
course do tend to think
of themselves as being
interdisciplinary and in-
terested. But, I guess, it’s
slight different now with
intercalated BSc, because
we’ve got students
who are attracted to the
philosophy component,
or the law component,
perhaps more than the art.
Probably a greater propor-
tion of them feel slightly
like a fish out of water
when it comes to art. But
Giskin’s first love was botany // Giskin Day
“The arts give
you, first and
foremost, the
opportunity
to learn to
manage
ambiguity”
and science. Students
have had a chance to have
a go at these various art-
forms, like life drawing
and sculpture, as well as
learning about the medical
contexts of the arts.

experimenting with the
idea of there not always
being one right answer
and how you still defend
an interpretation through
lots of different types
of evidence. I think it’s
hugely valuable for our
students to do that.
F: Another thing
you’re involved with is
the Science Communi-
cation Horizons module.
I think a lot of people at
Imperial maybe don’t
necessarily see it this
way, but no matter what
kind of career you go
into, you’re going to
need the skills to explain
what you’re doing, and I
think it is incredibly im-
portant for their careers.
G: I couldn’t agree
more. It’s quite a tricky
skill: when you write for
different audiences it’s
not about dumbing down,
it is really about pitching
yourself and your material
in a slightly different way.
Anditisinvaluable.Ithink
those kinds of skills are
becoming ever more im-
portant in a digital world.
It’s important not just to
be able to communicate
technical information to
others in your field, but
to think about different
audiences. And today,
we’re talking before the
Imperial Festival takes
place, which is a wonder-
ful chance for scientists
to leave the labs and the
ivory tower and engage
with real people who are
interested in their work.
F: Do you also think
that humanities and arts
students should study
some science? Can that
help their practice as
well?
G: I think we often
view the arts and sciences
as two incommensurate
paradigms, when actually,
there’s a lot of overlap.
They can both be analyti-
cal, they can both be emo-
tional, and they both have
elements of subjectivity
as well as objectivity.
So actually, there’s not a
great difference between
them, but just for the
purposes of academia, we
do tend to divide them up.
Artists are hugely inspired
by science and medicine.
Go to any art gallery and
you’ll find works that
have been really inspired
by science and the weight
of knowledge. I think that
we could all do with being
curious about everything,
and not pigeon hole
ourselves as ‘sciencey’
or ‘arty’. We should be
embracing both. They
complement each other.
effect of being part of an
institution in which the
rhetoric of excellence
sometimes interferes with
the permission to experi-
ment and permission to try
things out. That’s what I
think the arts are so useful:
you can be experimental.
The Horizons programme
allows students to expand
their boundaries and their
ways of thinking. It’s
a fantastic opportunity
for all undergraduate
students to engage with
subjects that make them
well-rounded individuals.
They can then graduate
with an education rather
than with just a degree.
F: Taking things back
a little, could you tell us
a little about your career
and your journey and
how you ended up here
today?
G: It’s slightly uncon-
ventional. I think I too felt
the pressure to go into the
sciences where I was more
inclined to humanities.
I did my first degree in
botany and biochemistry.
I loved botany – I don’t
know why I was doing bi-
ochemistry! But I always
had a feeling that I wasn’t
going to be a lab scientist.
I did want to go into
publishing and editing,
and I was lucky enough
to get a job with Black-
well Science working on
medical journals. And
then I landed a dream job
at the Science Museum,
working as the publi-
cations officer. I really
enjoyed it, I loved being at
the museum. At the same
time I was doing the MSc
here at Imperial in Science
Communication and at
that time I was starting a
family, so when Imperial
offered me a part-time
job teaching I jumped at
that. And then a few years
in I was offered a chance
to devise a proposal for
a medical humanities
course.
Irememberitincredibly
clearly, as being a moment
of being very torn. I didn’t
think the medical school
would be interested in
an arts-based BSc. I
very nearly just turned it
down straight away. But
then I asked a few more
questions and found out
the medical school was
totally on-board with
this, and have been very
supportive ever since.
The minute I got involved
in medical humanities
I realised that this was
my thing. My work has
always had some kind of
medical angle. When I
was doing botany I was
studying medicinal bark,
at Blackwells I worked on
medical journals, and then
when I was at the Science
Museum I was working
on the guidebooks for the
health matters gallery. It
felt perfectly suited to my
interests, and I’ve loved it
ever since. I think Medical
Humanities is a fantastic
discipline. Writers and
artists have such rich
perspectives to offer to
medical practice -- I’ve
so enjoyed teaching it. I
feel very lucky to have the
opportunity to teach in a
subject about which I feel
passionate.
F: Within your past
career you’ve had a lot
of different roles. Do you
think having that many
different elements to
your past career helps
you today in what you
do?
G: I think it definitely
does. I should practise
what I preach, and what
I preach is that interdis-
ciplinarity and creativity
are wonderful. So I really
think my past career has
pushed me to be innova-
tive and creative. I’m not
a particularly arty person,
but I think my creativity
manifests itself in playful
learning activities: I like
designing games to incor-
porate in my teaching. I
think if you’re an engaged
practitioner then you are
curious about the world
and you try to take in
as much as you can and
incorporate that into
what you know and what
you can pass on. That is
the fantastic thing about
teaching is that it’s also
lifelong learning. And I
learn so much from the
students as well. Being
a non-medic teaching
medics, the students have
a chance to practise their
communication skills.
They’re telling me about
what they know and what
they think. So that’s one
of the real pleasures of the
job: I’m always learning
from students.

F: I know I’ve spoken
to quite a few people
who, when I talk to
them about the Horizons
programme they say,
“that’s not really related
to what I’m doing”. Do
you think that kind of
distinction between art
and science is what is
creating a barrier of
people getting involved?
G: Without a doubt. I
think it starts very early
on in school, where if
you’re going to do the
science route you’re
obliged to take a certain
set of subjects. There is
definitely this two-tier
system, where it’s gen-
erally thought that those
good at maths go into the
sciences and those that are
not take the humanities,
which is a great shame.
Paradoxically, by the
time students get to uni-
versity, the arts feel too
challenging somehow..
But I think that is a side
