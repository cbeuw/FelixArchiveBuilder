T
he world has
seen a resurgence
of nationalism,
fascism, and
protectionism. These
pose an existential threat
to the world as we know
it. Liberal democracies
spreading wealth and
freedom via free market
capitalism have seen their
support checked by the
likes of Trump, Brexit and
most recently the elections
in Italy where the right
and far-right emerged as
the largest parties. The
question is why is this
happening? Large swathes
of the Western world have
prospered through the 20th
and into the 21st
century
with unparalleled growth
in living standards and
prosperity and yet there
are large swathes of these
populations, perhaps even
majorities, who have re-
belled against this system.
They have flocked to
groups who claim they
will protect the nation
and protect them from the
aliens from foreign lands.
They are voting for those
who claimthey will put the
indigenous first and return
the nation to a bygone
era of pride and glory. A
stupor of nostalgia has
entranced the masses. The
centreground, especially
the centre-left has strug-
gled to come to terms with
these developments and
understand the concerns
of the electorate, let alone
figure out how to meet
these.
If the old model is
broken beyond repair
then what can replace it
to provide a sustainable
and fruitful future? One
option lies within the
Bahá’í faith.
The Bahá’í faith was
founded by Bahá’u’lláh
roughly 150 years ago,
making it one of the
youngest religions in the
world. A key theme that
runs through the faith is
unityandoneness.Thereis
a oneness to humanity and
to the world. As someone
who does not belong to
the Bahá’í faith reflecting
on these notions in detail
and reading further into
the faith has revealed a
potentially different way
of viewing the world.
This idea of oneness helps
to identify the problems
already laid out in a new
light. The world has
become quite simply too
materialistic: the yearning
to acquire wealth because
it is inherently a good
thing. Those who believe
in laissez faire economics
would argue that the
desire for wealth has been
an entirely good thing,
driving competition and
innovation. This has ulti-
mately been to the benefit
of all even if a minority
became disproportion-
ately rich. However, the
Bahá’í faith believe this
as an ultimate goal does
not bring an individual
true happiness and as
humanity can be seen
through a lens of oneness
that all economic actions
have an intrinsic moral
nature that impact of on
others and the environ-
ment around us. There-
fore, wealth itself is not
to be frowned upon and
criticised but the way this
wealth is used must be to
the betterment of oneself
and of others. Those less
well-off must also ensure
that that they do what they
can to take the burdens of
others in the same way
that the rich are compelled
to do the same. The issue
arises as to how to bring
this about. The system
rewards wealth collec-
tion so there must be a
wholesale change to the
global economic system
which will take years and
concerted effort or the
onus falls onto individuals
to act in a different way
within the confines of
the same system. The
alternative is for the state
to impose change from
the top down mandate
certain behaviours; this
would be seen as an attack
on the wealth creators of
the economy who drive
growth.
The issue of economic
behaviour goes to the
heart of human nature;
are humans naturally
self-serving units maxim-
ising their own wealth or
is there a greater capacity
to help each other ? It’s
not just economics where

there has been increasing
turmoil and revolt, but
within politics itself too.
Nations have regressed
from being open to closed
off with the number of
border walls increasing
dramatically over the
last decade or so. This
arguably stems from
groups feeling left behind
and pulling the brakes
on globalisation. This
regression appears to fly
in the face of the oneness
of humanity. Rather than
people viewing them-
selves as citizens of the
world, rather people are
looking to nationhood
to ground their identity
in. This identity feeds of
the distinctions we create
between groups rather
than melt them away.
However, the Bahá’í faith
can put this down to the
parallel processes of inte-
gration and disintegration.
In order for the new order
to rise up the old must be
broken down. The world
appears to be becoming
a nastier place filled with
small, isolated nations
headed by those who pull
on the cult of personal-
ity to clasp onto power.
While the processes of
disintegration are plain to
see, one must look closer
to see how the processes
of integration are taking
hold in the form of the
digitalisation of informa-
tion allowing people to
connect across the globe.
Perhaps this system is
what we are seeing at
the moment, however;
I am not convinced that
this new world order will
be the world of unity the
Bahá’í faith hope to see
anytime soon.
