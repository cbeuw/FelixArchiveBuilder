representing about a
third of the total funding
from research grants and
contracts. The main areas
of such funding are found
in the Departments of
Physics, Medicine, and
Life Sciences. There was
also a general consensus
that the research being
carried out was of excel-
lent quality.
However, the report
highlighted there was
“greater scope for sus-
tainable and impactful in-
terdisciplinary research”,
and the College should
look towards “imple-
mentation [of research
outputs] where possible
on campus.”
The report also called
for greater integration of
sustainability into the cur-
riculum, saying students
at Imperial could “pro-
gress through their degree
without ever having to
critically think about
their actions on the envi-
ronment, society, or the
economy.” While there are

ondon has been
ranked the best
city for univer-
sity students,
beating out Tokyo and
Melbourne for the top
spot.
This is the first year
London has topped the
rankings, which are
organised by the higher
education company QS.
London came third in the
London rated best city for international university
students
rankings last year, being
beaten by Montreal and
Paris, which came first
and second respectively.
Only two cities in
the US are in the top 30
ranking, which is domi-
nated by universities in
Europe, Australia, and
Asia. This is a sharp
contrast to the QS World
University Rankings, in
which American institu-
tions occupy around 50%
of the top rankings.
The annual report,
which “showcases the
best urban destinations for
international students”,
uses a range of indicators
to generate their rankings,
ranging from the number
of ranked higher educa-
tion institutions in the
city, through to pollution
levels and the number of
graduates who stay on
after they finish in higher
education.
While London scores
highly on Student Mix,
Student View, and
Employer Activity, it is
among the least affordable
cities for students. A high
cost of living and increas-
ing rents make London a
comparatively expensive
city for students. The
average rent for students
at Imperial-owned proper-
ties stands at £175/week,
and private halls aimed
at students can cost up to
£430/week.
While QS said “rent
and living costs are signif-
icantly higher in London”,
theysaiditcouldbe“worth
every penny” due to the
educational, cultural, and
social opportunities. They
described the city as a
“nerve-centre of global
academia,” citing UCL
and Imperial, which rank
seventh and eighth respec-
tively in the QS World
University Rankings. In
total, 17 universities in
London appear in the QS
university rankings.
The QS rankings are
designed for international
students, looking at
moving to London for
university. According to
the Higher Education Sta-
tistical Agency (HESA),
19% of students studying
in this country are from
outside the UK – nearly
450,000 as of last year.
The most prevalent inter-
national non-EU group
are Chinese students, who
make up almost one third
of non-EU students.
courses centred around
sustainability, the expo-
sure undergraduate stu-
dents have to such content
can be limited; last
year’s Global Challenge
Horizons module – an
optional module available
to undergraduate students
– was cancelled due to
lack of demand.
Divestment
One area the report
highlighted was Imperi-
al’s investments in fossil
fuels.Around half of those
asked about what initia-
tives the College should
support said the university
should go Fossil Free,
with over 40 raising the
issue in further comments.
The report highlighted
the work that had been
done by the student pres-
sure group Divest Imperi-
al, who met with Imperial
senior management earlier
this year. The report said
the College “doesn’t think
it’s immoral to receive
funds” from fossil fuel
companies, and believed
investment in fossil fuels
was good for the environ-
ment.
The Greening Imperial
report recommends the
College investigate how
the endowment fund can
be invested in businesses
that are environmentally
sustainable. Professor Jo
Haigh, Co-Director of
the Grantham Institute
and Greening Imperial
co-author, told: “As a
first step we would like
to see college introduce
a Responsible Investment
Policy in order to assess
the environmental and
ethical credentials of
its current and future
investments. We hope that
Greening Imperial will
participate in and inform
the divestment debate
to help Imperial take a
leadership position on this
topic.”
Earlier this academic
year, an investigation from
Felix found Imperial had
nearly £9 million invested
in fossil fuel companies
through their endow-
ment fund. The College
also had £3.5 million
invested in tobacco and
£3.1 million invested in
the arms industry. In the
People and Planet league
tables, the College had a
rating of zero for ethical
investment.
Over the past couple of
years, the number of uni-
versities divesting from
fossil fuels has risen dra-
matically. It now stands
at over sixty institutions,
including King’s College
London, Edinburgh, and
the University of St.
Andrews.
Next Steps
The scoping study
presented to the Provost’s
Board was met with an
“overwhelmingly posi-
tive” response, according
to Professor Maitland, but
the report “still needs to
be approved as part of the
planning round process
over the summer.”
A representative of
Imperial College Union
said they welcomed the
report, and told Felix:
"With the backing of the
Provost’s Board and the
involvement of the past
two Deputy Presidents
(Finance & Services),
Rachel Blythe and
Matthew Blackett, as
co-authors, we are confi-
dent that this report will
lead to the change which
our members would like
to see at Imperial. We
would also like to thank
all of the students who
responded to the survey
earlier in the year. The
results of this have con-
tributed to shaping the
outcomes of this report.
We are looking forward
to seeing the changes
which College are going
to make off the back of
this report to improve the
sustainability of all our
campuses and operations
for students, staff and the
communities in which we
operate"
One concern for staff
and students at Imperial
may be the cost of imple-
menting the recommen-
dations put forward in
the three-year plan drawn
up by Greening Imperial.
The authors of the report
argue that not investing
in sustainability now will
lead to an increase in costs
in the near future, both
in terms of government
directives and expenditure
on operations.
Professor Haigh told
Felix: “Reducing the
environmental impact of
college will help to reduce
operating costs for util-
ities such as energy and
water so Greening Impe-
rial should make financial
sense as well as being the
right thing to do in terms
of our environmental and
ethical impact. It also has
the potential to help create
a more pleasant (greener)
working environment,
bringing people together
from across college and
promoting a stronger
sense of community.”

the bottom decile for
university sustainability.
Earlier this academic year,
Imperial came 141st
in the
People and Planet ethical
league tables – the lowest
scoring university of the
Russell Group.
The report said Imperi-
al’s ranking in the People
and Planet league tables
was due to both “Imperi-
al’s meagre reporting…
of its good practices”, and
“inadequacies in lead-
ership, policies, targets,
practices, and community
engagement.” They con-
cluded these benchmarks
raised “serious concerns
that we are lagging behind
our peers”.
Imperial has also faced
difficulties in reducing
harmful emissions: the
2015 University Carbon
Progress Report ranked
Imperial 107th
out of 126
institutions, after it had
reduced its carbon emis-
sions by only 9% in the
previous ten years.
Imperial has also
increased their overall
greenhouse gas emissions
since 2009; they will need
to reduce them by 60%
in the future to adhere
to government targets.
College Energy use has
increased by 15% per
capita over the last four
years.
Out of the 850 staff,
students, friends, and
alumni who filled out the
survey, 91% were dis-
satisfied with Imperial’s
national performance.
One member of profes-
sional staff who respond-
ed said this “poor engage-
ment” with sustainability
“carries a reputational risk
that could undermine
our academic work on
sustainability and climate
change.”
Communication and
Leadership
One of the main
areas for improvement
identified by the survey
was communication and
leadership: only 15% of
students could identify a
sustainability leader, 73%
had a poor understanding
of what Imperial does for
sustainability, and 82%
had a poor understanding
of the College’s current
performance on sustaina-
bility.
The report said the
College’s approach to sus-
tainability was “neither
clear nor very visible,”
and “reporting of relevant
data and achievement is
poor, or non-existent.”
While Imperial’s Strategy
includes action on sus-
tainability, it is “referred
to only obliquely… with a
put forward is the creation
of the position of Assis-
tant Provost (Sustainabil-
ity) – a new member of
senior management who
would “work with all
arms of the College” to
“drive the transformation
of our performance and
delivery in this area.”
The Assistant Provost
(Sustainability) would
report to the Provost, and
would be supported by a
Sustainability Leadership
Group.
Community
As well as involvement
from senior leadership,
the report calls for Impe-
rial to do more to foster
a community around the
goal of sustainability:
currently sustainability
comes under the remit of
the Health, Safety, and
Environment Committee.
Students, academic staff,
and alumni are not in-
cluded within the current
model.
The report says this
has meant the College
community feels “disen-
franchised and powerless
around sustainability”,
with students and staff
“currently feel[ing]
inhibited, or at least not
encouraged.”
Greening Imperial
recommend the creation
of ‘Sustainability Cham-
pions’ – identifiable staff
and students responsible
for promoting sustaina-
bility. Currently Imperial
has one such individual,
compared to around
100 at UCL and 150 at
Cambridge. Those behind
Greening Imperial seemed
confident such a commu-
nity could be developed
– 65% of respondents
to their survey said they
would like to be involved
in future initiatives.
This sense of isolation
was supported by some
of the comments received
through the Greening
Imperial Survey. One
member of professional
staff said they had been
“shocked” at “what I per-
ceived to be a total lack
of consideration for sus-
tainability and action on
climate change. I quickly
learned not to question
the processes in place or
voice my thoughts on the
matter – my perception
has sadly not changed.”
An academic member
of staff added they were
“ashamed to work at a
university that’s supposed
to pioneer sustainability
but are this bad at practic-
ing what they preach.”
Students have also
highlighted their dissat-
isfaction with Imperial’s
relationship with sustaina-
bility: a number of student
groups approached
Greening Imperial with
concerns over plastic
disposable cutlery and
single-use coffee cups
Research & Education

drive towards sustaina-
bility on campus is sur-

Imperial carries out. The

In comparison, univer-
sities such as the London
School of Economics
(LSE), UCL, and King’s
College London (KCL)
have made sustainability
more central to their strat-
egies. Greening Imperial
said this could lead to
“[erosion of] our compet-
itive position and our as-
piration to be the leading
London university.”
