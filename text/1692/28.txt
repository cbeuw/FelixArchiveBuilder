ou Bata be-
lieve it: we’re
back with
another of
ICXCAC’s many high
quality trips. For the
first time, we’ve taken a
full team of 25 to what
has been described in
previous years as “the
best trip I’ve been on
with Cross Country” and
“the daddy of all road
relays”; a description
that matches the expe-
riences of this year, in
the 46th
(and Imperial’s
4th
) Batavierenrace. The
race, a gargantuan 175
km, split into 25 legs, is
the largest student relay
race in the world, run-
ning through the night
and into the day, from
Nijmegen to Enschede.
Early on Friday
morning, while the team
was awake, they were
not united, and would
not be until they reached
the start. 14 soon-to-be
Batavierens piled into a
minibus and Mark’s car,
before heading off to
Nijmegen, accompanied
by 15 loaves of bread
and ten packs of cheese
(Mark left the pickle at
home, don’t tell Duncan).
With an efficient Chunnel,
some were able to stop at
the beach and still reach
their destination well on
time. The rest of the group
had the pleasure of taking
a coach to Eindhoven.
With such games as ‘who
has the red card’ and ‘why
does Mihai always have
the red card’, and a beauti-
ful ferry ride, the time flew
by. Before we knew it the
train from Eindhoven had
reached Nijmegen. There,
the team were united, and,
with tour t-shirts donned,
the race would begin with
Jack Mitchell taking the
baton back to the Radboud
Uni.
The race is split into
three stages, with eleven
taking on the gruelling
night shift before being
met in Ulft by the rest of
the team. Heinrich started
“After the race
we got ready
to party with
the other 8000
students in
two festival
tents and an
outdoor stage”
this challenge, but luckily
our runners would not
be alone. Accompanied
by a cyclist, on a bike
with ‘retina burning’ blue
lights, encouragement and
support would be within
arm’s reach. Mark and Jess
then delivered a strong
one-two before handing
to Filip and Tom. While
we suffered a small bike-
mare, we pulled through,
with Ian proving hard to
find for Georgia. Nomuna
managed to wake up in
time to finish the stage,
before we headed to Ulft
to get a bit of rest.
In the morning leg,
reverse Tri-Traitor Rowan
saw the light and put in a
rapid run to start us off, to
hand over to the former
24th
fastest woman in the
Netherlands Jenny Lea.
She couldn’t stop laughing
as she posted a rapid 16:19
3.8k. Due to the antics in
the night, we started the
day in 142nd
place, but
with every leg we were
improving. Maryna and
Anna advanced us to 72nd
.
“You’re the predator and
they are the prey, you’re a
tank, you’re flying, you’re
a flying tank!” were the
shouts of Mihai, as he
and Remy handed over to
Aymeric and Henry, who
did a great job of con-
vincing us they weren’t
injured. The morning
stage was done, we were
in 55th
, and had only minor
damage to our van.
saw club captain Alex
Mundell and Tour-rep
Duncan running from the
centre to the finale. With
thousands of spectators,
and ample water supply,
Alex posted the 6th
fastest
time of the stage, with
Duncan showing his two
hours of sleep and lack of
training with a solid 52nd
.
We finished 27th
out of
300 teams, which con-
sidering our issues, was
very impressive. What
was even more impressive
though was the fancy
dress for the afterparty.
With our best attempts at
retro runner, we got hyped
and ready to party with
the other 8000 students in
two festival tents and an
outdoor stage. We danced
to the links and rechts
well into the dawn, giving
everything we had left to
showing the Dutch how
its done.
The wake up call at
8:30 of music blasting
through the sports hall
speakers forced the 25
weary heads of ICXC up,
before heading back to the
vans and heading home.

In the afternoon the
rise through the ranks
continued. Euan, Greg,
Ophelie, and Matt all
put in strong times to put
us up to 33rd
. Could we
beat our position of 17th
from last year? Lewis
was clearly determined
for this, although he may
have just been keen to
get to the brewery at the
end of his leg. Liv then
finished of the journey,
matching Jenny’s and
Matt’s 5th
place in their
legs. The final stage
