Video games as an art form
An examination of what characteristics and features make video games creative and artistic.
A
re video
games an art
form? It’s a
bit of a con-
troversial question and
to some people, usually
“old” people and art
critics, it’s no ques-
tion at all. One of the
biggest voices against
considering games as
art was the film critic
Roger Ebert who battled
against the perception of
video games becoming
art all the way to his
death. His argument was
that no one in any field
had been able to name
a game worthy of com-
parison with great poets,
authors, and filmmakers.
The dictionary
definition of art is “the
expression or application
of human creative skill
and imagination”. With
this simple definition, it
becomes easy to consider
video games as art;
“Video games
incorporate
several pieces
of art and
creation
together into
something
new”
“Game
developers
have gone out
of their way to
add creative
touches”
more complex. Artists
work with the intention
of creating art and
expressing themselves.
In contrast, video game
designers, arguably,
intend to craft. Designers
put into consideration
things like how to push
the creation to as many
people as possible and
publicize it. While games
must be creative and
distinctive, their purpose
is usually to make money.
While this isn’t bad in of
itself, it could conceivably
take away from being an
art form.
Compared to most
other “critically defined”
pieces of art, video games
are a medium of mediums.
They have unique
graphics with an array
of 2D and 3D models as
well as immersive stories
and unique soundtracks
and effects. If they are
an art, they’re one that’s
unique to digital space
and are an amalgamation
of art and science. Video
games incorporate several
pieces of art and creation
together to make some-
thing new and unique that
transcends the limits of
any one type.
Video games are in-
herently interactive and,
for some, art is usually a
passive medium, in that
it requires you to observe
and reflect on what you
experience. However, by
the very act of interpreta-
tion, art arguable becomes
interactive. Games are
designed with a set of
rules and are restricted to
the limitations imposed
by the designer. However,
there is still a realm of
freedom and possibility
that a gamer is able to
make their own. Through
how you play, how you
explore, and how you
react, the gaming experi-
ence becomes a personal
one. Super Mario Brothers
can recreate the childlike
wonder in exploring a
colorful world, whereas
That Dragon, Cancer can
make you experience the
hopelessness of losing
a child. I personally
cried my eyes out at the
touching and melancholic
story of To The Moon.
And if you’ve found a
personal connection with
the work of another, then
the purpose of art has
been achieved.
As technology is no
longer a significant lim-
itation now as it was in
the past, game developers
have gone out of their way
to add creative touches in
order to add to the expe-
rience. These deliberate
constraints can include
limited controls, muted
colour palettes or abstruse
renderings; all of which
serve to enhance the
narrative and the emotion
experienced. Some note-
worthy examples are,
Thomas was Alone where
the minimalist aesthetic
made you feel more of a
connection to geometric
shapes, and Limbo where
the dark, silhouetted
universe created a feeling
of mystery and unease.
Due to the fact that
video games require effort
and attention to immerse
yourself in, it makes it
easy for non-gamers to
dismiss the medium.
Movies last around two
hours and books may
take a few days to read.
By contrast, some video
games need around forty
hours of dedication to get
the complete experience.
Some people also prefer
passive forms of enter-
tainment, not wanting to
bother with even a short
game; their loss at the end
of the day.
Video games can do
so much. They reflect the
world, challenge societal
ideas, make us question
ourselves and our morality
or, in the case of Super
Smash Brothers, bring
people together (or maybe
tear friendships apart with
this particular example).
While some people may
disagree, video games are
definitely a dominant art
form for the 21st
century,
and will likely continue to
be so for times ahead.
