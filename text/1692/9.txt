Happening today –100 years of Feynman
Born a century ago today, Richard Feynman was one of the most brilliant physicists of his generation. Science
Writer Sanziana Foia explains how his brilliance stems from a non-conformist spirit and a playful attitude.

“As Feynman
said: along
with curiosity,
disrespect
was the most
important
thing his
father taught
him”
R
ichardFeynman,
born on the 11th
of May 1918
in New York,
is one of the greatest
physicists and science
communicators of all
times. He is best known
for his work in the field of
quantum electrodynamics
and for his ingenious way
of representing complex
mathematics through
simplified diagrams.
However, his contribution
to science is more than a
series of discoveries. It is
about the human – or more
specifically, how the fears,
the joys, and the ambitions
of the human led to those
breakthroughs. Can one
mind change society? Can
the genius, the principles,
and the choices of a single
person all converge to lead
to great discoveries and
giant scientific progress?
In the summer of 1945,
ayoungmanwaswatching
through a truck’s wind-
shield something no one
else dared to view with
the naked eye. Only he
saw the blinding light and
the deadly cloud rising
from what was the first
atomic bomb in history.
However, in the shadow of
his beloved wife’s recent
death, the joy of success
was suddenly followed
by disturbance. The race
he had embarked to save
his country had a side
he did not contemplate
before, but that eventually
grew too prominent to
overlook – Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, two names that
became synonymous with
‘destruction’ in the young
scientist’s vocabulary.
In the aftermath of the
genocide he realised he
contributed to, Feynman
made himself a life-chang-
ing promise: he vowed
he would never again
use science to provide
humanity with such tools,
rather he would only
pursue it for a more selfish
reason – for the fun of it.
This promise, however,
was going to change more
than one man – it was
going to change mankind.
Deciding what is right
Richard Feynman
was born in New York
City, growing up through
the Great Depression.
His father worked in a
company that manufac-
tured uniforms for the
military, which made him
develop a strong distrust
of authority. He thought
humans should only be
admired for what they
“especially did” and not
because of their “name
and position – their
uniform”. As Feynman
later stated: together with
curiosity, disrespect was
the most important thing
his father taught him.
It allowed him to place
himself and his thinking
above social norms and
hierarchies, turning him
into a nonconformist.
could eventually turn into
something destructive.
However, he recalled he
used to enjoy physics, and
because he “used to play
with it, it was never very
important”. This decision
of only approaching
science with ludicrous
curiosity, and solely for
personal entertainment,
made him even more
of a nonconformist in
the world of science,
and shaped his style of
enquiry.
Nonconformity fuels
creativity
Individuals with an
independent concept of
themselves are stimulated
by standing out and being
seen as separate from
others. Insensitive to
isolation, they place little
value on belonging to a
group, and so renounce all
theconstraintsthatprevent
them from thinking by
their own rules within an
environment that demands
conformity. Exploring
unusual or controversial
ideas, which pose a high
risk of being rejected or
not being understood by
the scientific community,
led to some of the most
creative solutions and
truly, some of the world’s
greatest discoveries. This
was also the case with
Albert Einstein, who revo-
lutionised physics through
his theory of general
relativity, first proposed
to an incredulous public.
Another example is
Oswald Avery, who was
the first to state that,
contrary to the general
scientific opinion, genetic
material was represented
by DNA and not proteins.
Feynman was a non-
conformist as “he did not
need the external valida-
tion of having everybody
respecting him all the
time”. His manner of dis-
regarding the opinion of
those around him, which
was primarily instilled by
his father, enabled him
to assert his ideas in en-
tourages that were likely
to dismiss them. It is this
attitude that allowed him,
for instance, to become
one of the most valued
debate partners for Niels
Bohr. As Feynman said,
once he was made to talk
about physics, he would
forget about all social
subtleties. That is why
he pointed out any flaws
in the thinking of Bohr,
making him very appreci-
ated, though not liked, by
the great physicist.
But most important
for Feynman was – as he
had promised himself – to
play, guided by what was
“interesting, fun and right
to do”. He took a sabbat-
ical year to study viruses
and ants, a decision fuelled
purely by his refusal to
constrain his passions. He
also took drawing classes,
much to his colleagues’
discontentment, who
thought he was “wasting
his time” and gift for
Physics. When the time
came to be nominated for a
Nobel Prize, he scorned it,
saying he did not need any
honours. “The pleasure of
finding the thing out, the
kick in the discovery, and
the observation that other
people use it” was the
only prize he needed. This
playful curiosity, coupled
with anti-authoritarian
values, projected over
his style of enquiry. His
unconventional mode of
approaching problems
excited his creativity,
which meant he could
arrive to solutions in an
unprecedented manner

As a successful MIT
graduate and remarkable
Princeton PhD student,
he was recruited to join
the Manhattan Project at
a secret laboratory in Los
Alamos. The US feared
Germanywouldbethefirst
to invent the atomic bomb
and that they would win
World War II to become a
dominant power. This was
a defeat the US could not
afford, so the project was
put in place, taking on the
brightest physicists of the
time. Feynman strongly
felt it was part of his duty
as a citizen, so accepted
the job, and was integral
in helping the team speed
up their calculations.
America did win the
atomic bomb race and –
with that – the war. But
the fact that he contrib-
uted to the deaths of so
many individuals deeply
disturbed Feynman – the
whole race had not been
worthwhile. Leaving for
Cornell University to
become a professor in the
Physics department – and
still shaken by the events
of the summer – he devel-
oped anxiety about doing
anything important that

n recent years, we
have seen a spike
in the number of
fungal diseases in-
fecting wildlife, causing
population declines.
This includes the chytrid
fungus in amphibians
and white-nose syn-
drome in bats. Recently,
a new fungus has been
discovered in the US,
which so far seems to ex-
clusively infect snakes.
Snake Fungal Disease
(or SFD for short) can
infect the eyes, nose,
mouth, throat, and lungs,
resulting in blindness and
difficulty eating for the in-
fected snakes. In extreme
cases there is deformation,
which causes disability
in terms of feeding.
Scientists believe SFD
has been around for a lot
longer than we have cur-
rently identified, but – for
some unknown reason,
such as a change in the
environment – the fungus
has become more virulent
in recent years.
In the US, where the
disease was first discov-
ered, a number of snake
species have suffered
from localised population
declines due to SFD. It
may not sound important,
but snakes play a vital
role in the ecosystems
they inhabit, acting as a
natural pest control and
even helping to reduce
the incidence of diseases
like Lyme disease. With
the loss of snakes in an
environment, the levels of
pest species are likely to
rise, which may lead to in-
creased damage to human
property. Unfortunately,
SFD is not just restricted
to the US: it has recently
been found in the UK
and the Czech Republic.
Here in the UK it affects
our humble grass snake
but the true effects of the
disease on populations are
not currently known – our
snakes may be more resil-
ient, or they may decline
as in the US.
It is important to stress
that the diseases listed
above currently only
affect wildlife and not
humans, and it is very
unlikely they will pose a
threat to us. Most of the
time, the effects of SFD in
infected snakes seems to
be fairly mild, but in some
cases, and for reasons
which we do not yet
fully understand – it can
be extremely dangerous.
There is still a lot we need
to learn about in terms of
the mechanisms of spread
and infection of SFD. Due
to its relatively recent
discovery, there are so
many aspects still to learn,
but hopefully we will, one
day, be able to prevent
declines like those seen in
the US.

Sometimes it is im-
portant just to play
Feynman’s unorthodox
way of thinking stepped
in when physics was
confronting with a great
crisis. Classical theories
were beginning to fail at
explaining or predicting
all phenomena in the
universe, as a new field
was emerging: Quantum
Electro-Dynamics (QED).
This area of physics
describes the interaction
of light with charged
elementary particles. By
explaining how these
interactions work, QED
thoroughly explains
electromagnetism, one of
the fundamental forces of
nature and of the universe.
As electromagnetism
underlies how atoms
come together or break
apart to form molecules, it
explains chemistry. And,
as living organisms are
the result of a myriad of
complex chemical reac-
tions, electromagnetism
is also at the base of all
biological processes.
Without a coherent
QED theory, nature could
not be entirely understood.
But, there was a problem –
when the mathematics of
QED were not becoming
inhumanly complex, they
appeared to be flawed.
Some equations pre-
dicted results of infinity
for measurements that
yielded finite numerical
values in the laboratory – a
complete contradiction. It
was Feynman who found
the underlying cause of
this problem, though his
source of inspiration was
rather unconventional.
A student tossed a plate
up in Cornell’s cafeteria,
and Feynman observed
how the imprinted blue
crest of the university
was wobbling as the plate
was spinning down. He
“played around” with the
equations of motion until
they led to the similar
problem of the electron’s
spin in QED equations.
Richard realised the
equations resulting in
infinity did not mean they
were wrong, but that they
needed to be approached
from a different per-
spective. For a man who
decided to explore physics
for fun, and who did not
care about how his ideas
were going to be judged
by fellow scientists, this
was the perfect task. Feyn-
man’s strange method of
depicting complex mathe-
matical equations through
diagrams meant that the
complicated calculations
required by QED could be
side- stepped.
Though revolutionary,
Feynman’s idea was
unfamiliar and only un-
derstood by few at first.
Although some great
personalities of physics
raised objections, they all
soon began to acknowl-
edge the powerful tool
that Feynman had created,
and which eventually
brought him a Nobel
prize. QED was finally
a complete theory which
made meaningful pre-
dictions about the world.
The “most numerically
precise theory invented”
was working, and it was
all down to Richard Feyn-
man’s childish self, who
gave no importance to the
implications of his work –
he just wanted to play.
Feynman’s work has
found applications in
numerous fields that either
explain the world around
us or affect our daily lives.
From elucidating the
evolution of galaxies to
telecommunications, from
fundamental phenomena
to daily life, everything
has QED at work. Even
our smartphones and
computers might have
been science fiction today
if it was not for a young
heartbroken scientist who
decided not to ever do
anything important, in the
summer of 1945.
Do shifts within sci-
entists affect humanity?
Nonconformity, coupled
with an individual concept
of self and the mind of
a genius lead to spikes
in creativity. Creative
solutions are sometimes
found by exploring realms
that are novel, unusual,
and often get rejected by
the more conservative
thinkers. The choices
scientists make, and the
approaches they decide
to take when tackling a
problem, are reflected in
how they find a solution.
A problem solved, a small
success for a single man,
could become a scientific
revolution for mankind.
