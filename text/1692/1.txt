mperial College
London needs to
do more for sus-
tainability and the
environment in order
to keep up with fellow
universities, according
to a new report released
last week.
Greening Imperial, an
initiative to “understand
and improve how Im-
perial College London
implements sustainabil-
ity and action on climate
change,” have spent the
past year working on the
100-page report, released
last Friday.
The report, which was
based off a College-wide
survey, focus groups, and
multiple MSc projects,
concluded current work
on sustainability was
“largely uncoordinated…
under-resourced, and
poorly documented” with
“a limited impact on our
own operations and re-
search translation.” 98%
of those surveyed felt
Imperial should be doing
more to act on sustainabil-
ity and climate change.
Professor Geoff
Maitland, Professor of
Energy Engineering at
Imperial, and a Greening
Imperial co-author, told
Felix the report was “a
call to action to raise
Imperial’s aspirations and
achievements in creating
a sustainable, low-carbon
suture for itself and the
world. After all, if a uni-
versity such as Imperial
cannot take a long-term
systems view, how can we
expect governments and
society at large to take
these challenges serious-
ly?”
The authors suggest a
number of recommenda-
tions the College should
implement to fulfil their
promise to “safeguard the
environment for future
generations,” including
the creation of the higher
management post of
Assistant Provost (Sus-
tainability), the setting
of “meaningful sustain-
ability targets that are
consistent with national
and local targets”, and
engagement of the Impe-
rial community to deliver
these changes.
The paper was devel-
oped from the Greening
Imperial Scoping Study,
which was approved
by Provost’s Board in
February of last year.
The authors of the report
include academics from
the Grantham Institute
for Climate Change and
the Environment and the
Centre for Environmental
Policy, faculty staff, and
representatives from Im-
perial College Union.
Current Performance
Imperial’s Strategy
2015-2020, published in
2015, stated the College
would “substantially
increase our involvement
in advising governments
and industries” on the
environment. The report
highlighted a number of
areas where Imperial had
performed well, such as
a reduction in the amount
of waste going to landfill,
and encouragement of
cycling and public trans-
port use.
However, over the pre-
vious few years, Imperial
has performed poorly in
terms of environmental-
ism and sustainability,
compared to similar
universities, ranking in
