Looking after your mental health in exam season
E
xam season is
perceived as
dark and full
of danger. It is
highly likely that you
are feeling anxious, and
living off energy drinks
in the library – or perhaps
you are one of the post-
docs that survived exams
since you have the time
to read this! Nevertheless,
this article still concerns
you: maybe it is someone
you know, maybe you are
the one who is suffering.
Especially during this
stressful period, it is
important to learn about
various types of mental
illness, and what you can
do to help.
For some mental
illnesses,medicationsmay
not necessarily benefit the
entire population. Addi-
tionally, defining what
constitutes a disorder, or
distinguishing health from
illness, can be difficult
for psychiatric condi-
tions, since there are no
biomarkers such as blood
sugar level for diabetes.
Therefore, a better diag-
nostic and screening tool
is desperately needed.
Luckily, a simple test was
recently revealed to be
useful in predicting future
outcomes.
This simple Self-Rated
Mental Health (SRMH)
test allows patients to rate
their mental condition
from ‘Excellent’to ‘Poor’.
In an article recently
published in the Journal
of Health and Social Be-
haviour, a research group
showed SRMH to be a
better predictor of future
mental health status.
The advantage of
SRMH is that the assess-
ment is influenced by
both social and cultural
factors, as well as un-
observed qualities of
objective health, such as
severity, the persistence
of symptoms, and func-
tional limitations (e.g.
insomnia). SRMH can
also take life events into
account, including sepa-
rations, examinations, and
unemployment – aspects
undetected using clinical
objective measurements.
Some scientists have
concerns about the effec-
tiveness of this method,
as previous studies found
64% of the individuals
reported their mental
health as ‘good’, despite
being diagnosed for a
mental health condition.
One potential explanation
of such a phenomenon
may be that patients are
afraid of the judgement
they can receive following
a mental health diagnosis.
Some may feel that poor
mental health may be seen
as weakness, thus they do
not acknowledge the ex-
istence of such problems.
To ensure these effects
are removed, researchers
studied patients who were
diagnosed with mental
illness and followed them
for a year. If patients
are less likely to seek
treatment due to social
stigma, researchers should
observe an unchanged or
deterioration of mental
health in these ‘health
optimists’.
Surprisingly, the
opposite was observed.
30% of the optimists do
better than their pessimis-
tic counterpart – with or
without treatment – after
one year of follow up.
These ‘health optimists’
were more likely to
be Latino or African
America, and less likely
to be white or Cauca-
sian. Marital status also
affected how people rated
themselves – married
respondents generally
have a better score than
divorced patients. Fur-
thermore, people with a
higher level of education
and better socioeconomic
background tend to have a
better self-rated score.
While it is unclear
why these factors affect
SRMH, but one thing is
for sure: the usefulness of
such a holistic approach
to mental health evalua-
tion can improve current
mental health care. In
future, SRMH can be im-
plemented in the clinic by
asking patients how they
feel about themselves.
This can help to identify
individuals who may
benefit most from treat-
ment, and enable tailored
treatment for them.
To conclude, SRMH is
ultimately based on how
a person feels. We must
understand that a mental
illness is a disease of both
the mind and the body.
Asking one to ‘snap out of
it’ is as helpful as asking
a person with a fractured
leg to sprint. Those with
a better SRMH may
have a better sense of the
meaning of life, or they
are better at coping with
their symptoms. Whatever
the reason may be,
support from family and
friends is still one of the
most important aspects
of recovery for mental
illness. Even if you are
not convinced by the
effectiveness of SRMH
tests, showing you care
about people around you
can never be a bad thing!
EU moves to ban neonicotinoids
O
n Friday 27th
April, member
states of the
EU moved to
support the ban of outdoor
agricultural uses of three
important neonicotinoid
pesticides, due to concerns
surrounding their harmful
effects on bees and other
pollinators. This decision
followed the European
Food Safety Authority’s
(EFSA) publication in
February of a set of key
reports that concluded
these pesticides presented
an unacceptable risk
to wild and honeybee
populations.
Neonicotinoids, or
neonics, encompass a
family of pesticides that
were developed in the
1980s to be highly effec-
tive against insect pests,
but harmless to other
species, targeting unique
elements of an insect’s
nervous system. The three
neonicotinoids affected
by the new ban – imida-
cloprid, thiamethoxam
and clothiandin – account
for almost all of the neon-
icotinoid pesticides used
in the UK. In 2016, all
three were restricted from
use on crops especially
attractive to bees in 2013
– a decision that prompted
legal action by Bayer and
Syngenta, two leading
global manufacturers of
neonics. However, April’s
decision represents one of
the most comprehensive
and wide-ranging controls
on the use of these pesti-
cides.
Interest in the effects
of neonicotinoids on
pollinators, especially
bees, developed in the
mid-2000s and has more
recently become the
subject of a great deal
of public attention and
debate. One highly pub-
licised study from 2017
found that honey sampled
from around the world
contained a cocktail of
neonicotinoids. A second
study examined neonic
effects across Hungary,
the UK, and Germany,
and reported that bees
were less able to survive
and produce new colonies
when exposed to the
pesticides at field-realistic
doses. Despite mounting
evidence of the harmful
effects of neonics, the UK
government remained in
support of their use until
the Secretary of State for
the Environment, Michael
Gove MP, also announced
in late 2017 the intention
of the UK government to
back the proposed ban.
Bayer and Syngenta
criticised the ban, de-
scribing it in their press
releases as “a sad day for
farmers” and “[taking]
European farming in the
wrong direction.” They
stated that current scien-
tific evidence indicated
that neonics are far less
harmful to bee populations
than other hazards such
as the climate or disease,
and criticised the EFSA
report as “over-conserva-
tive.” The UK’s National
Farmers Union made a
similar statement, calling
on the British government
to work to mitigate the
impacts of the ban to
avoid damage to the UK
farming industry.
Critics of the ban have
also drawn attention to a
range of potential chal-
lenges posed by the ban
– from the obvious poten-
tial for impacts on crop
yields, to suggestions that
the loss of the relatively
selective neonicotinoids
will force farmers to resort
to older, less discriminate
pesticides. Syngenta have
further criticised the
decision as being based
on unapproved guidance
material, while Bayer sug-
gested their ongoing legal
action against the EU’s
2013 partial ban should
have forestalled further
action.
However, environmen-
tal groups have lauded
the ban, with Buglife
(The Invertebrate Con-
servation Trust) calling it
a “red letter day for the
continent’s pollinators.”
However, they also noted
that neonic residues
in the earth and water
may continue to harm
pollinators for years to
come, due in part to the
use of neonics in pet flea
treatments, which are not
covered by the ban!
