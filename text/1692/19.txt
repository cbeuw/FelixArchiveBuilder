Science for Heretics review – the heretics have not got
it right
Barrie Condon fails to convince in his attempt to overturn our current understanding and faith in science, which
leaves Books Writer Clemens Jakubec less than impressed.

T
he scientific
method is not
absolute. Every
good scientist
should be aware of that.
However, for scientists,
science and the scientific
method have proven to be
the most effective ways of
moving towards a more
objective view on the
universe around us. Barrie
Condon is such a scientist.
He is a trained physicist.
He held an Honorary
Professorship with the
University of Glasgow
and is the author of over
80 papers published in
peer reviewed journals.
Nevertheless, he
decided to turn his back
on his scientific back-
ground and to come out
as a ‘heretic’. In his book
Science for Heretics he
sets out to undermine out
current understanding of
physics, mathematics, and
basically all of science,
with moderate success,
to put it mildly. The book
is one big mess, in which
one wild claim follows
the next so quickly that
the reader hardly has the
chance to come to grips
with what has just been
stated before the next
claim hits them like a
freight train. Apparently,
there is a causal link
between arithmetic, the
ability to count, and the
horrendous mass killings
committed in the Soviet
Union and Nazi Germany.
If it actually exists, then
somebody please explain
it to me because I cannot
see it.
“Some of the
main problems
Condon has
with science
seems to have
their origins
in a dislike for
abstractions
and approxi-
mations”
“Condon is
clearly not an
expert in the
philosophy of
science”
Another one is that
mathematics does not
work because one plus
one never equals two.
This seemingly follows
from the fact that two
things are never ever
exactly identical. Not
even atoms. Or at least not
to our knowledge since we
cannot look at every atom
individually. I will come
back to this point later.
Here the author refers to
Nietzsche in what appears
to be a classic example
of an out-of-context quo-
tation. He speaks about
the concept of “zero” as
if it were some kind of
spectre haunting human
culture. The only thing
worse than zero is infinity,
and of course, Fourier
transforms. Be afraid of
Fourier transforms. Very
afraid.
Some of the main
problems Condon has
with science seems to
have their origins in a
dislike for abstractions
and approximations.
Even if no two things are
ever the same, I can still
imagine two things to
be identical. There is no
problem with that. This
is an abstraction. When I
say there are two cups on
the table in front of me
then I do not mean two in
every way identical cups
but two things that are
similar enough in their
“cupness” to be classified
as identical.
Furthermore, approx-
imations are ubiquitous
in science. Every model
in physics involves some
sort of approximations
and every good physicist
should keep them in the
back of their head when
deriving new theories.
Coming to the problem
that we are not able to
probe every atom indi-
vidually: This is a well
known philosophical
problem called the Induc-
tion Problem. Karl Popper
has circumnavigated this
problem by saying that
science can only ever
falsify a theory but never
verify it. Good theories
have to be falsifiable.
Although Condon
has experience with the
practicalities of science
and knows how the scien-
tific method is applied, he
clearly is not an expert in
the philosophy of science.
He is so keen on stepping
back from science and
trying to figure out what
science is actually doing,
that he completely misses
what science is actually
doing. In an attempt to
overthrow all of science
as swiftly and long
lastingly as possible, he
entirely falls short of
being critical about his
own ideas. Perhaps the
author should be more
heretical in relation to his
own theories, or the lack
thereof. The book does
not convey the picture of a
critical inquiry of the sci-
entific method, but rather
that of a blind and hysteri-
cal tirade against anything
and anybody that aims to
make a logical statement
about the universe.
Nevertheless, as I like
to get something positive
out of every book I read,
here are some of the things
I took away from reading
this book: it did make me
think about certain issues
regarding how science it
conducted. It also moti-
vated me to read up on
some of the philosophical
issues mentioned above,
such as the Induction
Problem. Although the
book makes for an invig-
orating – or sometimes
irritating – read, I do not
think that it will go down
in history as the work that
opened the eyes of thou-
sands of scientists to the
bitter truth of reality.
