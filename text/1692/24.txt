The London experience isn’t complete without catching a glimpse of the city from above. But you don’t always
need to spend a fortune – Elina Michaelidou shows us where to go for the most breath-taking panoramic views.
The London Eye
The London Eye is
one of the most famous
attractions in London,
where you can see views
of Big Ben, the Houses
of Parliament, and other
Westminster buildings
unfold along the River
Thames. It has 32 capsules
that run non-stop when
the attraction is open, and
each of them can carry up
to 25 passengers at once.
The entry is a bit pricey,
so make sure you book in
advance to benefit from
the online discounts and
skip the queues.
The Shard
The tallest building
in London, at 306m, the
Shard has everything
– from offices and restau-
rants, to apartments and
hotel rooms. Of course,
it also has a viewing
platform (that’s for those
of us who can’t afford
to pay £8,500 for a night
in their luxury suite – or
at least £450 per night
for a simple room). Your
ticket allows you to take
their fast elevator to three
observation points on
floors 68, 69, and 72. The
last one is outside so get a
jacket, especially on cold
Taking in the views of the London skyline at the ArcelorMittal Orbit // Elina Michaelidou
London from above: Felix’s guide to the best views
days – I visited the Shard
on a Friday evening in
late November, and it was
freezing up there! Also,
remember to book in
advance to ensure entry.
Sky Garden
Don’t forget to book
in advance for free entry
(yes, you read it correctly
– free entry) to the Sky
Garden, located inside the
infamous Walkie Talkie
building at 20 Fenchurch
Street. Tickets go on
sale up to three weeks in
advance, but be quick as
they sell out super fast,
especially during peak
periods (on weekends,
around Christmas, and
in summer). Upon entry,
you are given one hour to
grasp as much as you can
from there. The highlights
of your visit will not only
be the view of London but
also the indoor garden.
There is a lovely cafe, two
bars, two restaurants, and
a brasserie. Booking in
advance is advised.
The O2 Arena
TheO2Arenaisavenue
in Greenwich, where most
of the biggest concerts
happen. The ‘Up at The
O2’ experience gives you
a chance to “walk above
the stars”. How does this
happen? You are given a
harness, a pair of climbing
shoes, and climbing
clothes; then, you put all
your belongings (except
your phone and compact
camera) in a locker and
start “urban mountaineer-
ing” to the top of the O2;
at the same time big stars
may be performing under
your feet. If you haven’t
quite got it so far, you
don’t get an elevator or
stairs – you walk straight
up the side! The whole ex-
perience is approximately
90 minutes, including a
safety induction, a 20-25
minute climb, 15 minutes
at the top, and a 20 minute
descent. There are also
sunset and twilight climbs
but they cost a bit extra.

TRAVEL ArcelorMittal Orbit
Situated in Queen Eliz-
abeth II Olympic Park,
next to Westfield Stratford
City shopping centre (a
bit further from central
London – took me 50
minutes to get there from
my South Kensington
base), the ArcelorMittal
Orbit is really worth a
try. The best part of it is
the Slide! How does it
work? Once you arrive,
you put all your stuff in
lockers and take the lift
to floor one, where you
can descend the “world’s
largest tunnel slide”.
Then, you take all your
belongings, go back to the
lift, and this time get off
on floor two with the main
observation deck, offering
the views of London and
the nearby area. When
you’re done, take either
455 stairs or the lift to go
down. If you have time,
go for a walk in the park
or allow yourself some
time for shopping!
Emirates Air Line
This cable car runs
from Greenwich Penin-
sula to the Royal Docks.
It’s next to the Emirates
Aviation Experience (you
can get combo tickets) and
the O2 Arena. There are
different types of tickets
available, and you can
get discounted rates with
your Oyster card. Also,
if you purchase a return
ticket, you won’t have to
get off on the other side.
During the ride, you can
get excellent views of the
River Thames and Canary
Wharf. You can also spot
the Shard and even the
London Eye, just wait for
the right moment!
Tower Bridge
Tower Bridge is one
of the most recognised
landmarks of London,
but check its lifting times
before going. You can get
to the top of the towers
(take either the stairs or
the lift) and marvel at the

The French Riviera – a dreamy Mediterranean seaside paradise!

TRAVEL
A
s one of the
most popular
Mediterranean
resorts, Nice
does really live up to its
expectations! Its main
highlight is the azure sea,
so blue it almost looks
artificial and does justice
to the region’s name. The
only imperfection of the
beach is that it’s made
of sharp stones – quite
uncomfortable to walk
on barefoot – so consider
bringing a pair of special
beach shoes (or not – no
pain, no gain). While
chilling on the beach, you
can observe incoming
planes which seem to be
landing on water since the
airport is further along the
coast. You can also enjoy
the views of the beach
and the city from above
by climbing Castle Hill,
where you can find stun-
ning waterfalls and lovely
little paths.
The city itself is full of
palm trees and beautiful
fountains that light up in
a variety of colours in the
dark. The streets are very
lively, especially in the
evening. Loads of restau-
rants offer Mediterranean
seafood, and although
most places are quite
pricey, you can find happy
hours or other enticing
offers. Otherwise, there’s
always a McDonald’s
around. Finally, the main
street leading to the beach
is full of fashion shops if
you want to treat yo’self.
If you wish to explore
the rest of the French
Riviera, you can take a
train from Nice along
the coastline, where
going west will take you
to Cannes, home to the
annual Film Festival, and
going east will take you to
Eze village. It is situated
up on a hill so you’ll need
to get off the train at the
bottom and take a bus to
the top (or walk if you
dare) The altitude is quite
high, the road is winding
in sharp turns, and the bus
is going rather fast – it’s
an interesting adventure
but if you’re sensitive
to motion sickness, this
may not be suitable for
you. The village itself
is very beautiful – you
can explore its cute little
streets, visit the botanical
garden, and enjoy the
panoramic views. There
are also some art/fashion/
souvenir shops and res-
River Thames. There are
two walkways connecting
the towers, one on the
east side of the bridge
and one on the west. Both
of them allow you to see
the respective part of the
river and also feature a
glass floor in the middle!
Informative videos are
played in the hall before
entering each walkway.
At the end of your visit,
don’t forget to pop into the
Engine Rooms, situated
two minutes away from
the ticket office.
Monument
You can get a val-
ue-for-money combo
ticket for both Tower
Bridge and the Monument
to the Great Fire of
London for more of the
magnificent city views.
At the Monument, ascend
the 311 steps to arrive at a
viewing platform, which,
despite being small, offers
fantastic views of the
nearby area, including
the Tower Bridge and,
of course, the Shard!
However, if you want to
get a ticket from the ticket
office, remember that only
cash is accepted.
Bonus
A few other famous
tall buildings in London
include the Gherkin (30
St Mary Axe), the Heron
Tower, the Tate Modern,
and St Paul’s Cathedral
(paid entrance allows you
to climb 528 steps to the
dome). Another good
spot, though maybe not
as popular as the others,
is the highest point in
Greenwich Park, just
before entering the Royal
Observatory on the hill,
where you can look back
and admire the view. You
can see a panoramic view
taurants – plenty of things
to do for a day trip.
Going further along
the coast you will reach
Monaco – one of the
smallest and richest
countries in Europe.
The royal palace is on
a hill, which also offers
mesmerising views of the
sea and the city. You can
walk along the tiny streets,
chill at the park, visit the
oceanographic museum,
and do some souvenir
shopping. Just be prepared
to see many fancy cars and
yachts around! You can
then head back downhill
and take a city bus to
Monte Carlo, famous for
its casinos – even if you’re
not keen on gambling,
pop in to look around the
impressive interior.
Going even further east
will take you all the way
to Italy. You can get off the
train at any stop along the
coast and visit the beaches
nearby. They will be less
crowded than city beaches
and will let you explore
less popular areas.
Nice offers the best kind of summer blues // Edita Pileckyte
of the National Maritime
Museum and the whole
of Canary Wharf behind
it. And last but not least,
Parliament Hill in Hamp-
stead Heath and Primrose
Hill in Regent’s Park also
offer amazing views of
London.
Last tips:
Check the weather
forecast since you want a
(partly) sunny day. I know
this is not ideal if you want
to plan the trip early, but
if you leave it to the last
minute (two to three days
before), you’ll get a better
indication of when to go.
That’s what I did for ‘Up
at The O2’, ArcelorMittal
Orbit, and the Emirates
Air Line. However, this
is not a good practice
if you are short on time
or it’s the high season
and you want to go to
the Sky Garden. On the
other hand, cloudy views
of London are a more
authentic representation
of the city.
