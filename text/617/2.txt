Dear Mark
Of course there is no truth in
Nick Morton's rumour (let-
ters, last week) that I have
r e c e i v e d a s p e c i a l m e d a l
"awarded for sexual prowess
at the A G M " .
However great or small my
prowess, I have always man-
aged to contain it at U n i o n
Meetings.

Dear Mark
It really was marvellous to
read a series of errors and
misconceptions in your letters
section rather than your news
section. I refer to the drivel
written by Jeremy Nunns (not
noted for his well-informed
opinions). I shall attempt to
set poor little Jeremy straight.
Firstly, the idea was not
mine, but D o n Monro's. I did
not commission a costing of
the s c h e m e , but S t u d e n t
Residence Committee as a
whole. The Halls are not keen
to get involved in a central
l a u n d r y , they w i l l be u p -
grading their existingfacilities.
H o w e v e r , I C U C o u n c i l is
keen to see a launderette,
even if a wash costs 50p, for
many people in College who
do not live in H a l l . I have
informed the College authori-
ties of this and it is being
looked into for us. Inciden-
tally, if the U n i o n moves to
Southside, it may be possible
to incorporate a launderette
into the new plans.
D i r t y o l d J e r e m y seems
concerned about the aroma
caused by students who won't
wash their sheets. What about
people who won't wash their
clothes? O r themselves? But
then I wouldn't fancy washing
Jeremy Nunns. The points is
that two thirds of C o l l e g e
students live out and have to
wash their own sheets. This
they manage perfectly well
arid there has never been a
d i r t y bed p r o b l e m i n the
Head Tenancies where stu-
dents look after themselves. I
am sure Jeremy could soon
change that.
The serious question is, will
it cost a student £1 a week to
wash his/her own linen? With
bigger washing machines in
Halls, it obviously won't. T w o
obvious options are either to
wash the sheets with clothes
or to get together with other
people on the landing and
wash the whole lot together. I
c a n see the l a t t e r o p t i o n
w o u l d be a p r o b l e m for
n e i g h b o u r s o f t r e n d y I C
Radio disc-jockeys.
Finally, I am non-plussed
by a petition from a third of
the residents of Southside.
Why? Because I haven't seen
it. A n d where were they when
I reported the matter to a
U G M ? I was going to report
verbally to the first U G M this
t e r m a n d a c t u a l l y h a d it
written in Exec News for the
A G M . H o w e v e r , n o b o d y
came so we formed no policy.

C o u n c i l p o l i c y w h i c h is
different to the ideas I first put
to them. T o canvass student
opinion further, the Senior
Warder (retiring) has agreed
to ask new residents' opinions

Dear Mark
I must say it came as no
surprise to read those letters
in last week's F E L I X con-
cerned w i t h the F a l k l a n d s
crisis. The way in which they
were written does make one
wonder about the intelligence
of some people at IC. The
arguments against M r Alex-
ander's letter was predictable
and repetitive.
T o group everybody who is
u n h a p p y w i t h the g o v e r n -
m e n t ' s h a n d l i n g o f t h i s
situation into one category
a n d c a l l t h e m " B e n n i t e s "
shows some naivity; as does
raising Maggie above an altar
and worshipping her. This
government has not acted so
marvellously; even now there
appears to be disagreement
between M r s Thatcher and
M r P y m ; M r P y m does, I
think, realise that the crisis is
not over once B r i t a i n has
r e c a p t u r e d the F a l k l a n d s ;
meanwhile backbench Tories
chant "no sell-out".
A l l three letters exclaimed
the virtues of self-determi-
nation, but I thought that the
government had given up on
the idea that the will of the
islanders was of paramount
importance? Where else in
Britain does this occur? In
Northern Ireland a number of
people wish to belong to the
Republic of Ireland, but are
their views heeded? No, you
say, they're in a minority! But
as I understand it, no Argen-
tinian is allowed to purchase
land in the Falklands, so of
course they wouldn't be able
to support themselves, thus
the British maintain a majori-
ty; is that fair?
O K , so we should condemn
acts of aggression, like that of
A r g e n t i n a , b u t w h y does
everybody jump to the trigger
of a gun? I agree that we
s h o u l d s t a n d u p a g a i n s t
aggression, but is violence the
only way?
It's a b o u t t i m e p e o p l e
payed heed to U N decisions,
and we can't expect Argentina
to respect it unless responsible
countries, - like Britain, agree
not to r u s h i n t o s u c h a
s i t u a t i o n a n d sort it out
themselves.
Couldn't the Falklanders
have suffered the presence of
the Argentinian troops for a
c o u p l e o f m o n t h s w h i l e
negotiations were in progress?
Surely it would be less incon-
venient for them than a war?
Meanwhile, sanctions could
be imposed; we already had
substantial backing from a
n u m b e r of c o u n t r i e s . S o ,
maybe there would be coun-
tries that broke the sanctions,
like the U S S R , but if we also
agreed to penalise them then
a decision by the U N would
be more ellective.
As the Pope has said, while
in Britain, war is no longer a
sensible or v i a b l e way of
settling international disputes;
he must be right, unless he's a
Bennite.

Dear Sir
What arrogant hypocrites
some people are!
For M r Pettit's information,
the B r i t i s h are not a race
apart, and there can be few
countries that we don't share
b l o o d w i t h by n o w . T h e
A r g i e s d o n ' t c o m e f r o m
outerspace, and are humans
too. This may surprise M r
Reid, who does not sound
such a 'nice g u y " himself
anyway. I notice that none of
them offered to die themselves
—lack of 'guts' perhaps? If
being patriotic means putting
the value of human life below
that of human greed, then the
less patriots there are, the
better. We all have to live in
this w o r l d — it b e l o n g s to
everyone, not just the British.
T o start a war may take
'guts', but to prevent one
takes more than that—clear
sight and understanding, lack
of a r r o g a n c e , g r e e d a n d
selfishness, and a willingness
to share the world with other
people. Britain does not have
an automatic ( M a m m o n —
given?) r i g h t to r u l e the
world—we are here on the
same terms as everyone else.
T h e U N are not at a l l
c o n v i n c e d a b o u t B r i t a i n ' s
' r i g h t ' to the F a l k l a n d s
anyway. The British aban-
doned the Falklands in 1774,
as 'not worth defending', and
then the Spanish (from whom
we h a d taken them) used
them as a penal colony. After
Argentina became indepen-
dent from Spain, they claimed
them, in 1828. Britain re-took
them in 1833—an act which
the Argies have always com-
plained about. W h i c h side
w a s r i g h t w i l l p r o b a b l y
never be discovered, but they
are certainly as bad as each
other. The U N has always
told Britain to discuss it with
the Argies, and Britain has
always refused—not a very
good basis for antisism, is it,
M r Holt?
The Argies copied our own
methods exactly, even using
British ships and guns. The
patriots should, logically, be
pleased at such disgustingly
British actions. This "every-
thing we do is right, but if you
do it it is wrong" attitude
sounds like "some men are
more equal than others".
If it is wrong for the Argies
to do it, it was wrong when we
