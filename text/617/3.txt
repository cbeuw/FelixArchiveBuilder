T o p job for Piggy!
Dr Bryan Levitt, Director of Undergraduate Studies in
Chemistry department, was elected as Mayor of the Royal
Borough of Kensington and Chelsea last Thursday.
Dr Levitt, affectionately known as "Piggy" by the staff and
students in Chemistry has been a Tory councillor for some
years and has lived in the borough since 1962. He is currently
chairman of the Health and Housing Committee and was put
forward by his party, who hold a majority on the council.

Calling Cards
Last week details were finalised for the replacement of up to ten
conventional payphoncs by the new Cardphone system telephones at
various sites around the campus.
This is believed to be the first such installation on private property,
since up to now the system has only been available in R a i l w a y stations
and other public sites. T h e installation would probably commence in
October of this year, subject to the legendary lethargy of British
Telecom (BT) engineers.
T h e a g r e e m e n t for the r e p l a c e m e n t , r e a c h e d between B T
representatives a n d a College negotiating team composed of Captain
L i n d l e y , College Secretary J o h n S m i t h a n d College T e l e p h o n e
M a n a g e r Peter Burridge, follows reportedly extensive abuse of the
conventional telephones. Allegedly these have been used on many
occasions for transferred charge long distance calls, and arc subject to
mechanical tampering. T h e remaining conventional phones will soon
be strengthened to combat the latter problem, however.
T h e new system relies on plastic cards which are laser-etched to
indicate the consumption of charge units. W h e n a card is exhausted it
can simply be thrown away and a new one purchased. A d d i l o n a l l y . the
microprocessor-controlled cardphones send a high frequency tone to
them, unless a card is inserted.
T h e cards would be sold at various sites, probably IC Bookshop and
the Southside Shop. Each card sold would give the College I0"<> profit,
but because the rental for the cardphones will be considerably higher
than for conventional phones, many cards would have to he sold to
defray the extra expense.
What goes up.
It has been confirmed that the
partition in the U n i o n Lower
Lounge will be demolished when
the U n i o n Lower Refectory is
moved to the Lower Lounge over
the summer vacation.
A serving area is to be built at
the amusement machine end of
the L o w e r Lounge (consisting of
the heated trays and serving area
c u r r e n t l y used i n the L o w e r
Refectory) a n d the entrances to
the L o u n g e f r o m the c e n t r a l
staircase sealed to prevent use of
the eating area as a thoroughfare.
New kitchen facilities will be
b u i l t i n t h e o l d c l o a k r o o m
beneath the central staircase a n d
a washing up area created at one
end of the U n i o n Bar store.
It is intended to have a range
of furniture along the length of
the L o u n g e , c h a n g i n g f r o m
eating surfaces at the serving end
to bar furniture at the other. It is
estimated that only fifty or so
people will be able to eat at any
one time, but this is considered
sufficient.
T h e sealing of the doors to the
central staircase will make the
Lounge more of a room, with
only one entrance at the bar end.
The partition will be removed by

Dear Mark
M r M o r t o n is the o n l y
p e r s o n to h a v e p r o f e s s e d
knowledge of the reason for
m y r e s i g n a t i o n as D e p u t y
President, but in fact he has
no such knowledge. Whereas
I would like to be able to say
t h a t I ' d b e e n honest a n d
resigned because I did not like
the job or because I could get
more money elsewhere, I did
in f a c t , r e s i g n p u r e l y o n
principal: I was apparently
responsible for a shortfall in
U n i o n income of £3,000.
O n resigning I was expect-
ing to be asked to reconsider,
on the grounds of everything
I've done for I C U in the past,
and that it was not entirely
my own fault that I was taken
advantage of by a vending
company, etc., etc. But it did
not happen. I heard rumours
that the inquorate C o u n c i l I
had left behind me (not the
o n l y o n e ! ) h a d a s k e d M r
M o r t o n to ask me to recon-
sider, but a l l he said was
" Y o u don't have to do this
you know, Barney." Well, in
the face of this reaction, from
someone with whom I was
supposed to continue working,
a n d w h a t w i t h p r e s e r v i n g
honour etc., I had to go.
I have been disappointed at
the recent petty vindictive
references to me in F E L I X .
Have people forgotten that
I've contributed to life at I C
over the last three years? I
think not. There are just some
who care jealous of the fact
that I had the courage of my
convictions and left. I'm sorry,
if I have let y o u or y o u r
readers down. It was with
great regret that I made this
decision.
I wish all who still care
about I C U the best of luck in
keeping it together.
I wish all who came to get
degrees to get the best of
degrees.
A s for me, well, I've still got
J i l l and one or two friends.
Thanks for a splendid 3 3
/ 4
years at I C .
Tours sincerely
