Polyester Certificate X Directed by John
Waters Starring Divine, Edith Massey,
Tab Hunter.
Bad taste films acquire a bad smell in this, the
latest work of trash king J o h n Waters. Starring
once more at the head of a team of wonderfully
bad actors is obese transvestite Divine and the
m a r v e l l o u s l y u n t a l e n t e d E d i t h M a s s e y (a
personal favourite).
In Polyester M r W a t e r s has t a k e n the
carefree world of modern American house-
wives and turned it upside down. F r o m the
o p e n i n g shot of a quiet s u b u r b a n house,
followed by the immense form of Divine (as
Francine Fishpaw) rolling out of bed, it is
o b v i o u s t h a t t h e b a d t a s t e h a s b e e n
glamorized a little.
U n l i k e W a t e r s ' previous efforts ( w h i c h
include the incredible Pink Flamingos) we are
treated to a fairly c o m m e r c i a l p a c k a g e ,
including the gimmick of Odorama.
This isn't the first time a "scratch'n'sniff"
card has been supplied with a film,—but it is
certainly novel and works very well. Francine
Fishpaw is a normal American girl apart from
her extra sensitive sense of smell. A s we follow
the antics of Francine, her porn-king husband
and her extraordinary family, numbers flash up
on the screen to signal a start to feverish
scratching at correlating patches on your card.
The odours are not always pleasant, but the
mixture of anticipation and participation was
so e n t e r t a i n i n g that it successfully drew
attention away from flaws in the actual film.
A s I have said, Waters has gone for an up-
market, toned down version of his previous
bad taste extravaganzas. In the process he still
manages to include a teenage disco maniac
daughter, a foot fetishist son, a millionairess
who was formerly Francine's cleaner (played
by the ever delightful Edith Massey) and a sex
mad secretary.
Francine is deserted by her husband (in
favour of the secretary) and she turns to drink.
Her daughter gets pregnant and is taken away
by cruel nuns, while her son is arrested as the
"Baltimore footstomper". After her world falls
apart, Francine starts to pick up the pieces
when she meets the all American heart-throb
(Tab Hunter) but things soon turn tragically
wrong.
P o l y e s t e r m a y not be a great a r t i s t i c
achievement, but it certainly entertained the
audience and managed to invert many of my
values. There is no romance and beauty—just
cruelty, ugliness and some violence. But by the
end of the film the bad taste became terribly
catchy and what John Waters wanted to say
was gradually becoming clearer.
If you liked any of Waters' other films then
you will certainly enjoy this. If you've never
seen one, why not—it could be worth the risk.

The Jeweller's Shop by Pope John Paul II.
Directed by Robin Phillips, Westminster
Theatre.
The Jeweller's Shop was written by Karol
W o j t y l a in 1960 w h e n he was B i s h o p of
Krakow. It is one of half a dozen plays and is
a lyrical reflection on love and marriage. The
play is indebted to the author's poetry, and to
his past experience as co-founder and actor of
an unusual theatre group during W o r l d W a r II,
the Rhapsodic Theatre.
The three acts of the play deal with three
couples whose life stories are inter-twined. The
two central characters in Act 3 are the children
of the couples in the preceding two acts. The
parts are supported by an unusually strong
cast including Hannah G o r d o n , Lalla W a r d ,
Paul Daneman, Christopher Blake and John
Carson. The unifying thread running through
the three acts is a jeweller's shop, in whose
window the couples see their marital future
reflected. The jeweller is a mysterious god-like
figure whose scales weigh not the physical
mass of wedding rings but their spiritual quality
whether of the past, present or future. The
author's strong sense of destiny in the affairs of
Hannah Gordon (Theresa) in a scene from Pope
John Paul's play The Jeweller's Shop at the
Westminster Theatre.
men (and hence necessarily in marriage), and
the capacity of a married couple to 'reflect'
their spiritual or divine nature (the resulting
combined reflection being much brighter than
the sum of their respective parts), is superbly
complemented in the stage designs consisting
of r e f l e c t i v e p a n e l s b a t h i n g in r e c e d i n g
perspectives of lines.
Contrary to what one might expect of a
bishop's play Wojtyla approaches his theme
without dogmatism or sermonizing. Neverthe-
less, the question that one must inevitably ask
oneself is this: if the author were not as
celebrated as he is, would his play be staged?
The answer is most definitely 'no'. M u c h of the
play consists of monologues, and the general
lack of action makes the work thoroughly
untheatrical. It would be much better suited
for radio presentation or preferably still, in
book form. The play may well appear to be
baffling, self-indulgent or wandering to people
u n f a m i l i a r w i t h the P o p e a n d w h a t he
represents, but it is the sort of work which
certainly deserves quiet, unhurried meditation.
However, the play at the Westminster Theatre
will probably draw crowds for some time to
come because of its very high curiosity value
and the opportunity afforded of glimpsing the
p s y c h e of the w o r l d ' s m o s t c h a r i s m a t i c
individual.
