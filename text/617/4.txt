did, and we would have no
'rights' in Falkland, Gibraltar,
Ireland, etc., at a l l — o r if we
have, then they must be right
also. Y o u can't have it both
ways. ( A n d there were no
British living there when we
invaded, so you can't use that
excuse either). T h e A r g i e s
treated the Falklanders a lot
b e t t e r t h a n t h e B r i t i s h
t r e a t e d i n d i g e n o u s p o p u -
lations.
Most Falklanders live in
tied cottages owned by British
or A r g e n t i n i a n c o m p a n i e s .
T h e y have to leave the island
w h e n t h e y r e t i r e a n d the
children have to leave at 15,
when the education system
ends. T h e i r jobs are all they
h a v e to lose. A s M a g g i e
doesn't give a d a m n about the
wishes (or jobs) of the British,
you have to be very brain-
washed to believe she cares
a b o u t t h e i r s . S h e is n o t
capable of it.
Whenever there is a war,
people (on b o t h sides) get
k i l l e d . ( T h i s is w h y w a r s
shouldn't happen.) It is not
the w a r m o n g e r s w h o get
killed, it is sheer hypocrisy for
people who support the war
to pretend sympathy for the
relatives of men they sent to
t h e i r d e a t h s . H o w m a n y
h u m a n lives does M r Pettit
think it is worth anyway?
There will be no peace in
the world while greedy patri-
ots are in it. People must learn
that all people are people (yes
they are, M r Pettit). T h e y are
not here to be killed, but to be
lived with.
W a r is not one c o u n t r y
against another, but mindless
patriots against reason and
truth. Y o u can choose between
the g r e e d a n d a r r o g a n c e
which is patriotism, or the
h i g h e r things o f l i f e — e . g .
p e a c e , t r u t h , l i f e , G o d ,
h u m a n i t y , etc. m a k e y o u r
own choice—don't let anyone
make it for y o u — B U T make
sure you know both sides first,
or you will be stuck with your
choice. I am not patriotic, but
I a m a Christian, and serve a
higher power than myself. It
is not possible to serve G o d
and M a m m o n and this coun-
try long ago chose M a m m o n .
H u m a n lives are worth more
than islands, really. It is often
that I agree with the Pope,
but this time he is right—war
is no way to 'solve* anything,
and you can't be a Christian
and a patriot. It's your choice.

R e R a g Charities ( F E L I X ,
615, letters).
O n e item on the agenda of
the large R a g C o m m i t t e e
meeting on Thursday, M a y
20, was this subject. Since we
are unlikely to get the licences
that have been used in the
past, it will be necessary next
year to find out which charities
are collecting on which day
and obtain street collecting
licences from these charities
and donate the collection to
them.
In R a g Week a n d for events
that d o not i n v o l v e street
collections (e.g. sale of R a g
M a g s , R a g F e t e ) it w a s
decided that various charities
would be collected for, one of
which will probably be the
N a t i o n a l D e a f C h i l d r e n ' s
Society (reducing the donation
we make rather than ceasing
help entirely) the point being
m a d e at the m e e t i n g that
£500 does not make such a
difference to the quality oflife
of a deaf child as it would do
to a child in say, Africa.
It was suggested that a
request should be made to
students for the names o f
charities to be put forward
(with reasons for their propo-
sal) a n d for suggestions for
next year's R a g emblem (a
s m a l l p r i z e m a y be f o r t h -
coming for the best d r a w i n g /
idea.) R a g Committee can
lie contacted via the letter-
rack in the U n i o n Office.
Observers are allowed to
any meeting of any committee
(unless a motion is passed at
the meeting that it should be
a closed session, e.g. when
d i s c u s s i n g sensitive issues).
T h e best ways of finding out
when a meeting is to occur are
to look at the bookings book
in the U n i o n Office or ask. a
m e m b e r o f the c o m m i t t e e
concerned or send a note to
the group concerned via the
U n i o n Office.
I hope that this information
will have been of some use to
G r a e m e Shaw a n d others.

PS: I only found out when
the meeting was to be held
because someone in m y year
was asked to attend.
