The Penultimate Issue!
The next issue of FELIX, my last, will be on
F r i d a y , J u n e 18. T h e d e a d l i n e f o r all
contributions (including small ads) is 5:30pm,
Tuesday, June 8. This issue will take a full two
weeks to prepare, so I hope you don't all piss
off home before it's published.
FELIX Rally
We've still got room for a few more teams to
take part in the F E L I X Motor Rally o n Sunday,
June 20. Clues will be set for various locations
The Shape of
FELIX
To Come
It is traditional for the Editor-elect to make a
statement of intent, either at the time he is
elected or in the last F E L I X before he takes
over. I didn't write one last term, but the end of
June will be too late for the things I want to
say, so here goes
The style of a newspaper is the product of
two factors: there is design, by which I mean
layout, typeface and use of space generally;
and there is content. When Steve Marshall
t o o k o v e r as E d i t o r t w o years a g o he
completely redesigned F E L I X to the present
format. He did an excellent job. I think Mark
was wise not to alter it a n d , apart from
redesigning the letters page, I don't intend to
either.
But as far as the content of the newspaper
goes there are several things I want to say and
my reason for writing this statement of intent
now rather than at the end of term is to give
you plenty of time to comment on my plans
before October when it will be too late.
The main point I want to make is that to be
interesting, F E L I X must have support from its
readers. O n e of the things that really annoys
me is the number of students who ridicule
'another boring F E L I X this week' on Friday
morning, and then do nothing for the rest of
the week. Contrary to popular belief, F E L I X
doesn't appear by magic and if the Editor isn't
to spend all his time on the technical side of
things he needs the support and enthusiasm of
(amongst others) photographers, cartoonists,
reporters, collators, feature writers, news
writers and people to think up witty headlines
at six o'clock on Thursday.

College, we can't report it unless we know
about it first (strange but true!) and we're
dependent on IC Stude and his lecturers and
College staff to tell us. The reason we resort to
space-filling news stories ("James Deeny Goes
Swimming") is often because the interesting
things which happen around College (and I'm
certain that they do) never reach the FELIX
Office. The reason B.B. Wolffe's column hasn't
in London as well as a list of "treasure" items
to collect. Examples of previous questions can
be seen in the FELIX Office. Further details on
request—entries do not close until 9:00am on
the day when people gather for the start at the
F E L I X Office.
FELIX Bound Editions
If by any chance you have the good taste to
want a presentation set of this year's issues,
they can be ordered from the office at a cost of
approximately £14.50. F o r this s u m y o u
receive a beautiful leather bound set, tastefully
embossed with your own name in gold. I have
some full sets of copies or you can complete
your own collections if necessary.
Brief Mention
The A C C A G M is at 6:30pm on Tuesday, June
15.
Also Marco Ledwold tells me that anyone
can propose people for pots before Joint
Council on June 21.

appeared as regularly as we would like is that
no one sells us the gossip which comes their
way. If you want to see it in print, you've got to
tell us about it.
Pep-talk over, let me get on to some specific
plans for next year. C l u b s a n d societies
articles (with one or two notable exceptions)
are dull. S o many of them seem to say ' X Club
had a very interesting meeting last week.
Professor Y gave a talk on Z and next week
such-and-such will take place.' Next year I'd
like to replace these articles with an extended
What's O n column looking a little like the
Radio Times: lots of information and a short
review of events with potentially wide public
appeal (e.g.—dare I say i t — S T O I C trans-
missions) but a single line 'reminder' for
regular events which are unlikely to attract
anyone but regular attenders anyway (e.g.
Dancing Club). O f course, if any club wants to
write a long article or advertisement for a
specific purpose (I know Dramsoc want to do
this to plug auditions) they are very welcome,
e s p e c i a l l y if t h e y c a n b a c k it u p w i t h
photographs. But I do want to get rid of
articles which are written just because the
society has a publicity officer whose job is to
write articles for FELIX.
I'd like to have more humour in F E L I X next
year, but this is likely to be difficult. Ridicule and
cynicism are easy to produce but tend to pall
after a while, whereas clever satire and parody
are difficult to write consistently well. Still, in
7,000 students there must be a budding Alan
Coren somewhere, mustn't there? Cartoonists
are always welcome, too, of course.
Soapbox will continue to provide space for
those who have something to say, and no
doubt the letters page will provide space for
those w h o don't. Incidentally, if potential
Soapbox writers discuss their article with me
before they write it, I'll be happy to offer
advice o n h o w to stop it looking like an
unappetising sea of grey print.
T w o years ago F E L I X used to print a
summary of the week's national news, and this
is a feature I am considering re-introducing.
Reactions of those I've asked have been
mixed; some think it valuable for those who
have neither time nor inclination to read daily
papers, some think otherwise—'If students
can't be bothered to get informed, they don't
deserve to be.' What do you think?
Finally, regretfully, I have realised that next
year is not going to allow me enough time to
continue writing the Scaramouche column. I'm

Already people are expressing concern at the
lack of cooperation between next year's Exec.
Although all three members have opinions on
the important issues which will face the Union
next year, none has found out what the others
feel or made his own views known; indeed
M a r y F r e e m a n s e e m s u n a w a r e of t h e
existence Of the other Exec members.
There are two main decisions the Union is
f a c i n g n e x t y e a r ; w h e t h e r t o m o v e to
Southside and whether to hold a refectory
boycott. A s a public service, 1 have ascertained
the views of our three leaders-elect and, to
n o b o d y ' s g r e a t s u r p r i s e , t h e y a r e n o t
unanimously pro or con either of the schemes,
although no one opposes both of them.
If Steve knew all so far revealed, and also
Phil's opinion on the Southside move, he could
deduce all of Phil's and Mary's opinions. A n d if
Phil knew all so far revealed, he could deduce
Mary's and Steve's opinions. So what do they
all think?
Solutions, comment, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office, please. £5 (donated by Mend-a-
Bike) for the correct solution randomly
selected at 1:00pm next Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution
A symmetric solution is shown in the diagram.
Note that every grid line intersects exactly two
dominoes; this is essential for the solution to
work. Keen mathematicians may like to work
out why this is so, and extend the idea to show
there can be no fault-free tiling of a 6x6 square.
The prize was won by G . J . Rickard, Plasma
Physics P G , who was selected from thirty
entrants.
Too many complaints about easy puzzles,
so this week's is designed to make you think a
bit. But the next issue of FELIX will contain my
last bow: some very easy puzzles, some of
average difficulty—and all the puzzles I've
been too merciful to set before. Prizes will be
increased in proportion to the difficulty. Don't
miss it.
very keen to replace it with some sort of
weekly puzzle or competition, though, so if
you have any ideas and especially if you'd
consider taking over as puzzles editor then get
in t o u c h . I ' l l be h a p p y to c o n t r i b u t e
occasionally, but a regular puzzle won't be
possible.
Lastly, let me echo my first paragraph: all
this is still ideas and aspirations and the serious
planning doesn't start until I take over on July
1. Whatever ideas, plans, criticisms you have
in mind, I'm in and around the FELIX Office to
discuss them most afternoons. But above all,
tell me this term. I expect my plans to come in
for some criticism, but if they're criticised now
I can amend them appropriately. Criticism in
October will be too late.
