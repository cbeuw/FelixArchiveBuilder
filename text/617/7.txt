Berenice by Racine. Directed by Christo-
pher Fettes. Lyric Studio, Hammersmith.
It's exactly a year since Christopher Fettes
showed that classical French drama could be
made accessible to English audiences with his
vivid production of Racine's Britannicus at the
Lyric Studio, Hammersmith.
The plot of Berenice is of classical simplicity.
Antiochus, a King, loves Berenice, Queen of
Palestine, who in her own turn'loves the newly
anointed Emperor Titus. The parts are played
respectively by Peter Eyre, Sheila Gish and
Martyn Stanbridge. But because the Roman-
laws forbid the Emperor to marry a foreigner,
Titus smothers his helpless love for the Queen
in favour of his duty to the state. At the play's
e n d , the three depart from each other,
regretfully and tragically.
Racine wrote his play to be performed in full
Louis X I V rig, with trocade coats, ceremonial
a r m o u r a n d s u m p t u o u s d r e s s e s . T h e
production at the Lyric, however, is in modern
dress with a simple but smart set. The play is
formal and rhetorical but is imbued with a n
a u s t e r e e l e g a n c e . T h e p a s s i o n a t e a n d
e m o t i o n a l i n t e n s i t y of t h e play is k e p t
Garfield Morgan and Martyn Stanbridge in a
scene from Racine's Berenice, at the Lyric
Studio,
marvellously under rein by the restrained,
dignified rhetoric. The play's characters are
prey to their passions, yet they can analyse
their struggles in speech which dissects as
clarly as a knife.
The play is well worth witnessing but you
need to be in a relaxed, attentive mood to
appreciate and enjoy it.

George Orwell A Life by Bernard Crick,
Penguin £2.95 (paperback).
This is an excellent book. Bernard Crick is a
professor of politics and he writes pompously,
but any book about George Orwell is almost
doomed to look wordy and too full of waffle
because you'll inevitably compare it with what
Orwell himself might have written. The style of
the book is too longwinded (The questions are
not wholly seperable', etc.) w h i c h partly
explains the book's length: five hundred and
eighty pages, not counting' the appendices,
notes, index, a n d the good selection of
photographs. But it's very readable, Prof
Crick's done about as good a job on Orwell's
biography as you could reasonably expect.
The account of his life is fairly complete and
detailed, including the chapters o n Orwell's
c h i l d h o o d , a part of p e o p l e ' s lives that
biographers tend to skip. The only serious
fault of the book is that too many speculations|
about minor features of Orwell's life and work
which are hardly worth theories at all. (For
example at the age of eighteen Orwell, or Eric
Blair as he then was, bought a cage rat trap
and Crick says "Thus Blair brought the cage
that eventually was thrust at the face of
Winston Smith in Nineteen Eighty Four). i
The most i m p o r t a n t question about a
biography of a writer is, does it give you a
better understanding of his character than you
can get from reading his own works? The
answer for this book is definitely yes. Y o u can
find out a lot about Orwell, in his own books
and essays b u t here a r e features of his
personality, particularly his attitude to women,
that are brought out much more clearly in this
biography. The most unexpected part of the
book is the description of Orwell's almost
pitiful efforts to get some woman to marry him
after the death of his first wife. He made
clumsy proposals to women he hardly knew
and wrote them embarrassing letters after they
turned him down. Of course this (and a lot of
the rest of the book) is interesting partly
because of the ordinary nosey pleasure of
r e a d i n g o t h e r p e o p l e ' s l e t t e r s , but it is
something of a revelation. It may even have
been partly the reason why he asked for no
biography of himself to be written. C r i c k
doesn't discuss this request at all, which seems
a strange omission. •
All in all the biography is good and readable,
assuming you're interested in George Orwell
at all.

A merry band of I C cricketers again- took to
the Northern Line, this time ending u p at
Collindale. Phil Eastland tore down the hill
and made a good impression of a fart in a
force ten. F o r t u n a t e l y B i l l H i n m e r s was
throwing the ball up the hill. For once it
t r a v e l l e d i n the c o r r e c t d i r e c t i o n — the
reasons appeared to be the similarity to the
veld in long lost Zimbabwe and the lack of
any darker skinned brothers. Masher finished
a useful spell with a piece of play acting that
K e v i n Keegan would have been proud of.
The result being that the possible jug of beer
was not forthcoming.
Before the ensuing batting collapse, the
performances o f P h i l N i c h o l l s a n d P h i l
C r a w f o r d - S m i t h s h o u l d be m e n t i o n e d .
Although both looked menacing dressed in
white there was a tendency for knock-ons and
attempts to control any flying object a n d
boot it into touch. Phil Nicholls also reported
t h a t F r a n k ' s r a s h persists t h r o u g h t h e
summer months.
The batters failed miserably as usual. The
only part success being 'Plug' Hobbs who,
p l a y i n g w i t h h a l f a n ear, m a n a g e d to
contribute the most to the fines pot. W e won,
it was a sunny day, V i l l a won, the fines pot
did well—who cares about quizes!
