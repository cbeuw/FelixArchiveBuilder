Not the DP's bit
Lower Lounge/Lower Refectory
Following Council's agreement, the scheme to
provide a new catering outlet in the Lower
Lounge will take place over the summer. The
i n t e n t i o n is t o b u i l d a s e r v e r y at t h e
a m u s e m e n t machines e n d of the L o u n g e
serviced by a small kitchen (to be installed
where the old cloakroom is now). T h e room
will graduate from refectory type furnishings to
a bar area at the other end. The access to the
central staircase will be closed and yes the
partition will be removed! All club and society
property will have to be removed from the old
cloakroom and an alternative storage area
provided. I would be grateful for co-operation
from the clubs involved in moving everything
towards the end of the term.
Proposals for Union move to Southside
I a m presently analysing the exchange and
provision of space suggested by the initial set
of p l a n s . I w o u l d w e l c o m e c o n s t r u c t i v e
criticism and interest from clubs and societies,
there are sets of plans available in the Union
Office. I must stress that everything is at a
discussion stage. When costings have been
made, then we will be able to start to consider
whether the p r o p o s a l is advantageous o r
whether we are in danger of becoming proud
owners of a basement aircraft hanger.
Southside Shop
Increased publicity and the sportswear sale
have helped the turnover of the shop this term.
W e will be i n t r o d u c i n g a larger range of
sportswear, a new range of clothing (including
T-shirts with the IC crest in a small breast logo
version) and films, before the end of term.
Games Machines
We now have a full complement and these are
surviving well except for the quantities of beer
seeping into the pinball tables due to people
placing drinks on top. Please don't!
DP's Committees
The dates of the joint committees chaired by
the Deputy President are:
House Committee, Tues June 8, 12:45, Union
Office.
Union Finance Committee, Friday June 11,
6:00, Lower Refectory.
Internal Services, Monday June 14, 12:45,
Union Office. S o those concerned will have no
excuse for not coming.

Sunday: Guilds Pub Crawl; R C S Barnight.
Guilds Barnight will be o n Friday, December

It is up to all groups whether they choose to
follow this, but if they choose otherwise then
tough cheese if their attendances prove to be
low!
Likewise events for the I C Calendar. With
hindsight I realise I should have pressurised
C C U H o n Secs-Elect for dates of major events
last term rather than this (future H o n Sees
please note) so 1 can do nothing if clashes
already exist. I hope to have a full list by the
end of this term, however, and so events
arranged after then should be made after
consultation of the Calendar.
Many thanks to Ind Soc, Wellsoc and S F
Soc for their prompt response to my request
for a list of events for next term.

Labour
Despite the fact that most other
societies have ground to a halt,
the Labour Club carries on. O n
Tuesday, Stuart Holland M P will
be s p e a k i n g at 1:00pm in the
Union Upper Lounge. D r Holland
was one of the Labour rebels who
voted against the Government on
the Falklands issue so come along,
it should be very interesting.
SF Soc
What can I say? This column has a
reputation for being very silly. In

has become very hard to be sillier
than reality. Margaret Thatcher

RADIO
D o y o u notice anything different about this IC Radio article? If not, you
ought to, because that's a brand new logo at the top. We've retained the
almost-legendary crocodile, but changed the shape of the wording so that
it's a bit more eye-catching.
The longest radio programme in the world?
This weekend on IC Radio, Jasper will be challenging the record for the
longest continuous radio broadcast, which currently stands at 48 hours
30 minutes. It all starts on Friday evening, and he'll be playing the sort of
music to revise to continually until late o n Sunday night. S o tune in on
301m to some of the marathon program if you can.

Industrial Design
Engineering PG Course
The pioneering students of this new course will be exhibiting at the Royal
College of Art's Degree Show from June 11 to 20.
This new and unique postgraduate course is organised jointly by the
Royal College of Art's School of Industrial Design and Imperial College. It
is designed to bridge, at high level, the gap that exists between the design
and engineering professions. The course can lead to the Master of Design
(M Des) award of the Royal College and also to the Diploma of Imperial
College (DIC).
Candidates must possess a degree in engineering (or its equivalent),
normally at 2.2 or higher grade. Those with industrial experience are
particularly welcome. Evidence of creative and visual potential is also
sought. A high level of motivation is essential.
The course is based on practical projectwork, supplemented by
lectures in a wide range of design, engineering, management and cultural
subjects. A f t e r initial visual design training, the industrial design
engineering students are integrated within R C A ' s School of Industrial
Design. This has proved to be of mutual benefit. The visually exciting and
creative environment of the Royal College, and the generous practical
help received from the more experienced industrial design students has
been of great value to the engineer. A t the same time the engineers'
c o m b i n a t i o n of self-discipline, stamina a n d searching objective
questioning has had a beneficial influence on the School and College.
First Year project-work is oriented towards industrial design. In their
second year the I D Eng students are encouraged to undertake a major
project with a substantia] engineering content and a 'design-make and
test' element, and so become eligable for ICST's D I C award.
I D E n g students are provided with studio and model/prototype
making facilities at the R C A , and test facilities, study space and more
specialised prototype facilities at Imperial College.
Students are free to follow their own line of development. Some
become oriented more towards industrial design, some more towards
engineering, others towards management. In some cases the students
need more time to develop their full potential in aesthetic design but the
overall quality and depth of their work is very satisfactory indeed.
Despite the pressures of this relatively intensive course the students are
active in School and College affairs, cultural events and the R C A ' s
Design for Social Need programme. It is generally agreed that this course
is attracting very high quality students.
This year's I D Eng Degree Show exhibits are expected to include:
Developments in concrete frame machine tool design, and domestic
space heater (Sweeney); Domestic sewing terminal embodying radical
new principles (Tarn); Mobile X-ray machine for hospital use (Lowe);
Wire rigging cutter with one-handed operation for emergency use o n
dismasted yachts, and music stand (commissioned) (Douglas).
