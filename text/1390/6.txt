Student opinion: Felix surveys
How have you found your
first term at Imperial?
It’s been very exciting,
interesting and a bit stressful
because I just got here.
How have you found the
workload?
It is getting bigger and bigger
with time: Masteries, problem
sheets... but once you
manage your time and get
involved then it’s okay.

How have you found the Union?
The Union can be really good but
can also be bad. The cheap beer is
the main point to go there, as well
as for the free bar nights as well.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
Imperial is just the same but it’s
bigger and there are more people
to meet!
Imperial came 3rd in August’s
Good University Guide, however
it would have come 1st if student
satisfaction was higher: did
you know about this? Does this
surprise you?
I was expecting the course to be a
bit better, and that we would have
more help. Also, I expected that
more and better events would take
place but I know that some serious
changes are ready to happen.
How have you found your
first term at Imperial?
It’s been difficult in terms
of work, but I’ve found it
enjoyable otherwise.
How have you found the
workload?
The workload has been
reasonable, considering the
course that I’m doing
How have you found the Union?
The Union has been pretty good
so far. It’s better than I was
expecting it to be.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
I’ve only visited Manchester and
Warwick universities so far, and
from what I’ve seen Imperial
appears better.

satisfaction was higher: did
you know about this? Does this
surprise you?
It’s no surprise to me since I’ve
experienced the poor quality of
contact before coming here. Then
again, that’s expected from a
research orientated university.

How have you found your
first term at Imperial?
Fun! I’ve really settled in
well and met tons of people.
The work is tough but really
interesting.
How have you found the
workload?
It’s steadily increased
throughout the term, but it’s
not become unmanageable.
How have you found the Union?
I haven’t ever used the main Union
but the medics’ Union is amazing!
There are lots of great events etc.
We don’t get much information
about the main university Union.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
It’s much better! However, there’s
a much bigger workload. All the
friends that have visited me from
other universities are jealous of
our location and the atmosphere.

Good University Guide, however
it would have come 1st if student
satisfaction was higher: did
you know about this? Does this
surprise you?
I didn’t know about this and yes,
it does surprise me. Some people
are never satisfied!
How have you found your first
term at Imperial?
My first term has been great. It’s
less nerdy and more social than
I expected it to be.
How have you found the
workload?
Miniscule.
How have you found the Union?
ICSMU is great. The Reynolds
Bar is an amazing place to get
hammered. As for ICU: I’ve only
been once.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
The social life could be better. It
would be good if there were more
societies and less anoraks.
How have you found your
first term at Imperial?
It’s been fun and very busy
with lots of work and social
events.
How have you found the
workload?
The workload was quite light
at first but as term progressed
the workload has dramatically
increased.
How have you found the Union?
I haven’t used the Union much. We
tend to go out for student nights
at clubs in London such as The
Ministry of Sound.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
It seems a bit more expensive than
my friends’ universities probably
because it is in central London.
It also seems like I do a lot more
work than them.
Imperial came 3rd in August’s
Good University Guide, however
it would have come 1st if student
satisfaction was higher: did
you know about this? Does this
surprise you?
I didn’t know about this and it does
surprise me because most people
here are very friendly and helpful.

Does this surprise you?
No, I didn’t know about this
and no, it doesn’t surprise me.
The non-academic side could
be better and the lectures
aren’t world class.
