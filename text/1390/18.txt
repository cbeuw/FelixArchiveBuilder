What is your favourite Panto of
all time?
Although I love playing
an Ugly Sister and work-
ing with Antony in Cin-
derella, I also love doing
solo dame. Last year I
appeared as Widow
Twankey in Aladdin
at the Hazlitt Thea-
tre, Maidstone, and
that was a lot of fun.
I suppose every
dame’s dream is
playing Mother
Goose. It’s the lead
role - the Hamlet of
dames!

I
think we all need a holiday. How
convenient that we now have a
Christmas break to enjoy. ‘Tis
definitely the season to be jolly;
but also the season to eat your
own weight in turkey, mince pies and
other dried-fruit containing foodstuffs.
This is the part of Christmas I like best.
For at least 5 days, any diet should be
put on hold or, favourably, thrown out
of the window entirely. Diets are stu-
pid. Eat what you bloody like.
Christians say we have something to
celebrate at this time of year, and al-
though I think the majority of modern
society has forgotten the source of our
festivities, we should keep in mind why
we have this holiday in the first place.
I was listening to the IC Choir per-
forming Messiah last Friday and it in-
spired me to think how much we have
to owe to people’s beliefs. So much
amazing art and music was created
because people believe so fervently in
something unknown or unsure. This is
demonstrated in the Messiah and also
in the Renaissance Siena exhibition
I went to see at the National Gallery,
which is reviewed in these pages.
So, at Christmas when the carols
and cards come out of the cupboard,
we let so much wonderful art into our
lives and homes without realising it
(with the exception of the rendition of
“On the 12th Day of Christmas, your
mum got from me…” by my boyfriend’s
flatmate).
I am surprised this year to see the
return of the ‘traditional’ Christmas
in popular fashion. Shop windows,
adverts and decorations seem to have
erred away from the glitzy silvers and
blues, and returned to the much-loved
reds, greens and golds.
I have tried to stick to this theme
throughout this Christmas bumper
edition. Opposite is the Stanzas for
Students - a real Christmas classic!
It has everything a Christmas poem
could wish for – candy sticks, fat Saint
Nick and stockings. It has some won-
derful rhythms and rhymes in it so
please, please take the opportunity of
reading it aloud! I’m sure your lecturer
would love to hear a Christmas addi-
tion to his/her material when you de-
cide to perform it mid-lecture.
There have been so many fabulous
events going on around college re-
cently. Mtsoc’s fabulous Winter Revue
is reviewed on the next page.
I attended the ICSO concert a cou-
ple of weeks back. The obvious high-
light was the soloist, Lukas Medlam
performing Barber’s Violin Concerto
– edge of your seat, look-how-fast-
his-fingers-go stuff. The other pieces
were very atmospheric and inspiring
also. The concert was packed as usual
and the quality of playing was superb.
If you haven’t seen our Symphony Or-
chestra’s concerts, make the time to
go along to their Spring term offering.
You will not be disappointed.
We have been sending writers all
across London this term to see new
plays, exhibitions and etc. If you want
to get your ore in, please get in touch!
What a load of pantaloons!
Rosie Grayburn interviews Panto Legend, David Phipps-Davis and his 48G bra
W
hat could be more
Christmassy than
bringing one of
the Great Brit-
ish, gender-
swapping traditions, The Panto
Dame, to the Arts pages! Dav-
id Phipps-Davis is a talented
singer, director, drag-artist
and panto-dame. He has
been putting on a corset
and fabulously flamboyant
outfits for years for our
amusement in roles such
as Widow Twankey and
the Queen of Hearts. Here
he is with some make-up
tips for the boys and mas-
sive tits for the girls: Enjoy!
What pantomime are you in
currently?
I am currently appearing in Cinderella
at The Camberley Theatre in Surrey. I
am one of the Ugly Sisters - Vicky Har-
dup. My sister, Antony Stuart-Hicks, is
called Lauren Hardup (she after Cath-
erine Tate, me after Little Britain). This
is the second time Antony and I have
been sisters, though we also appeared
togetherastheQueenofHeartsandthe
Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland.
What is your favourite part of do-
ing pantomime?
The audience involvement - as soon as
we enter, the audience are booing and
hissing. In our current show when we
get Cinderella to rip up her ticket to
the ball, they want our blood! There’s
nothing like it!
Who would your ideal Buttons
be?
Buttons is a hard role because you have
to be funny but also the audience have
to believe that you really love Cinderel-
la, but not
in a pervy way. When I was
a kid I saw Rolf Harris
do it twice and he was
perfect.
Who do you
model yourself
on when you’re
playing an Ugly
Sister?
I have seen at least
one panto every year
since I was three and
I have seen a lot of
Ugly Sisters and Wick-
ed Queens to steal ideas
from. I can’t think of any-
one particular I model my
Ugly Sister on, but I know my
ten years as a drag-artist have
helped.
Student Art In Focus – Decent Art!?
This week: Clandestine Beauty by Axl Rose. I think we may have found a winner!
E
ntitled Clandestine Beauty,
this piece of art photogra-
phy is one of the few surviv-
ing works of my fellow band
mate, Axl Rose, before his
foray into the work of rock music.
Although we can only see her eyes,
it is clear that the girl beneath the ba-
laclava is gorgeous, but she hides this
– her way of refuting the superficiality
of physical beauty and emphasising the
fact there is way more to life.
The turquoise of her make-up is de-
signed to calm away the troubles of all
whom behold her.
The red of the ribbon is love’s tri-
umph over hate and terror (brought to
mind by the mask).
But perhaps the most important el-
ement is the door in the background
suggesting an escape; the horrors of
today’s society are enough to make
anyone take flight.
This week’s artistic analysis was
brought to you by Saul Hudson of
Guns ‘N Roses fame. Slash, as he
is better know, is now lead gui-
tarist of Velvet Revolver and has
recently published his autobiog-
raphy Slash: The Autobiography.
When he is not playing his gui-
tar, he spends his time wishing
he were a better drummer and
remembering to close the fridge
door. Congratulations to Slash
who is now fifteen months clean!
Don’t do heroin. Or any other sub-
stances. Ok?
If you want to see some equally
decent art, please send it in to
the usual address (arts.felix@
imperial.ac.uk) and we shall use
our specially sculpted dodo-bone
fine-tooth comb to pick it apart to
tell you what it really means.
How long does it take you to get
into costume?
About half an hour, though we have
to keep getting in and out of cos-
tume. This year we have ten costume
changes!
And finally: lace or silk panties?
Silk.
Bra size?
48G - more like a couple of buckets on
a bit of string than a bra.
And any make-up tips for our
readers?
Subtlety. Always subtlety. Seriously.
Try as much stuff as you can and
find what works for you. An-
tony uses water-based
but that sweats off me
so I use a combina-
tion of grease
and powder
- and have a
very strict
skin care
regime or
I’d end up
looking
like Tu-
tankha-
men.
