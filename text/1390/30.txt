Buffalo Burgers and Champagne!
Sally Longstaff and Alex Casey get themselves a slice of the new menu at the real burger kings, GBK
Here’s a treat to try before you haul ass home for some Christmas grub
It’s almost Christmas, and dis-
counted mince pies have already
taken over most supermarkets.
Not that I dislike them, but oc-
casionally I would like to have
an alternative choice – preferably
something from my hometown,
Hong Kong – to warm up the cold
afternoons.
Custard tart is a big thing in
both Hong Kong and Macau (an
ex-Portuguese colony just east
of Hong Kong). It is in fact origi-
nally a British treat, so big up to
the Land of Crumpets. The main
differences between the two ver-
sions is that the former is served
warm and has a weak gel texture,
whereas the latter is served cold
with a texture closer to scram-
bled egg.
Either way, the custard tart
seems to be a forgotten treat in
this country. The Hong Kong ver-
sion is quite easy to make – the
only annoying part is shaping the
pastry bases, but you can always
get help. You may struggle to find
evaporated milk (note: not the
same as condensed milk!) in the
small supermarkets; the big ones
will always have them in tins. If
you really can’t find any, normal
fresh milk is fine.
Being a British pastry original-
ly, it is no surprise that this treat
goes very well with English tea.
For the record, you can also try
evaporated milk with tea – it re-
ally does taste better than using
ordinary milk. So here it is: a per-
fect afternoon tea in Hong Kong!
Tools:
• Electric oven (190 °C)
• Fridge
• Scale
• Sieve
• Tart tray or metallic tart cups
(I use a 3” [d] x1.25” [h] hole x12
tray)
• Egg beater/fork
• Tart paper cups (optional)
Ingredients (Serves 12)
For the pastry:
• Salted Butter - 280g
• Fine sugar - 105g
• Egg yolk – x4
• Evaporated milk - 60g
• Flour - 470g

Richard Lai
• Vanilla essence - 6 drops
For the filling:
• Warm water - 225g
• Eggs - x3
• Evaporated milk - 60g
• Fine sugar - 75g
• Vanilla essence - 3 drops
Instructions
1. Pastry: mix butter and sugar,
and then mix in egg yolk. Beat until
smooth
2. Add milk and vanilla essence,
and then sift flour, work dough
3. Chill dough in fridge for 15
minutes
4. Split dough into 12 balls, and
flatten each into tray (make it at
least 4mm thick, and make the bot-
tom inner edge fairly sharp so that
there is more space for the filling,
as well as not wasting any dough).
5. Pierce 3 holes at the bottom
of each pastry base, and then chill
them for 15 minutes
6. Preheat oven to 190 °C for
later use
7. Filling: mix sugar into
warm water until dissolved, and
then let it cool to room tempera-
ture (CRUCIAL!)
8. Strain eggs through
a sieve, and whisk into sugar
solution
9. Stir in milk and vanilla
10. Strain final mixture
through a sieve, and fill up the
each pastry base with it
11. Bake for at least 25 min-
utes, or until the filling is set
12. Enjoy the warm custard
tarts!
Tarts as far as the eye can see. Did someone say obesity? Bring it on!
T
uesday night saw the
launch of the new part-
nership between Gourmet
Burger Kitchen and Lav-
erstoke Farm Park, which
aims to create a new premier range
on their menu. Purely in the name
of research, Felix writers Alex Casey
and Sally Longstaff went along to the
launch party to find out more.
Amongst the more interesting names
on the menu were the Laverstoke Buf-
falo Burger (£9.95) and the Laverstoke
Organic Wild Boar Burger (£8.95),
both of which were sweetly packaged
in bitesize baps. Whilst the Buffalo
was not unlike beef, but perhaps with a
slightly stronger, more smokey flavour,
complemented well by the onions and
garlic, the Boar Burger, which is cer-
tified organic, tasted quite like a nice
pork sausage. The zingy mayonnaise
also added something to each, but
equally appetizing was the spicy red-
currant sauce on offer, teaming up well
with the flavours.
Whilst both are slightly more expen-
sive than most of the burgers on offer
at GBK, generally falling in the range of
about £6-£7, the quality and adventure
are well worth the price in the opinion
of these reporters, and certainly within
the grasp of a student budget!
GBK started in the UK in 2001 and
have a well-deserved reputation for
high quality food. Their philosophy
about “produce, handled and prepared
with care to produce exceptionally
fresh and delicious food” is certainly
carried through into the restaurants
themselves, where each burger is made
to order.
The new links with Laverstoke Farm,
owned by 1979 Formula One Cham-
pion Jody Scheckter, are descibed as
“very exciting” by Davis Sykes, Manag-
ing Director of GBK. He says “We are
confident that the two new additions
will prove popular with burger lovers,
as it gives them the opportunity to be
adventurous and try something very
different”.
Laverstoke Farm Park’s approach to
farming is a very different one to tradi-
tional farming, involving a Soil Lab in
order to monitor the biology in the soil,
a 5 acre compost site for fertiliser, and
pastures for the animals containing 31
different herbs, clovers and grasses. It
is little wonder then that the farm was
awarded Best UK Food by the Taste of
Britain awards, run by The Telegraph
and Sainsbury’s. Jody Scheckter de-
scribes his aims for the farm as “...[to]
produce the best-tasting healthiest
food, without compromise”. Having
tasted the meat on offer last night, in
this writer’s opinion, he has produced
some of the tastiest meat in the UK!
The event to mark this landmark
partnership was held at the St Paul’s
GBK. The service was excellent, espe-
cially the free champagne that flowed
with alarming regularity. The burgers
were fresh and hot, and included some
other burgers from GBK’s extensive
range.
The vegetarian “burgers”, were also
very nice, although the neon green of
the falafel burger was hard to get past
initially. Also on offer were mounds of
fresh fruit, bread and cheese. It was a
truly excellent evening culminating in
speeches by both David Sykes and Jody
Scheckter, with the raffle drawn by an-
other former Formula One Champion,
Damon Hill.
The restaurant itself, like many in the
GBK range, took its decor as seriously
as its menu, especially in comparison
with the wealth of identical burger
chains on the high street. It continues
to provide a welcoming and high quali-
ty ambiance, in addition to its excellent
food, whilst not being stuffy, preten-
tious or over-priced. Well worth a
visit!
The nearest Gourmet Burger
Kitchens to the South
Kensington Campus can be
found on the Old Brompton
Road and the Fulham
Broadway. Prices start at £5.65,
beer from £2.95, soft drinks
from £1.85 and milkshakes from
£3.25.
