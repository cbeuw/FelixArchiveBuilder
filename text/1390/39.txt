How to rate yourself:
Under 9 words: The wheel may be spin-
ning but your gerbil has died. Lets hope
you get a brain for Christmas.
10 – 14 words: You are so dense that light
bends around you.
15 – 20 words: You’re not as stupid as you
look, are you?
21 plus words: Well done, you linguistic
leviathon! Merry Christmas!
Last week’s solution:
The seven letter word was:
CONDOMS
Congratulations if you have condoms.
Other words included:
codon, codons, cods, condo, condom,
condos, cons, cocs, docs, dons, doom,
dooms, mods, mono, monos, mood,
moods, moon, moons, moos, nods, snood,
sodom, soon
How to play
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up with
must include the central letter. Capitalised
words, conjugated verbs (past tense etc),
adverbs ending in “-ly”, comparatives and
superlatives are disallowed. A word you
are not allowed in this case would be “Fe-
lix” as none of the letters can be found in
the polygon. I think you know the rules by
now.
Virgo
You wake up
Monday morning
realising you have
grown massive
bingo wings. You
take advantage of
this newfound talent by pleasing your partner
physically and shaking them wildly during
intercourse. This completely acceptible
behaviour continues until he is knocked out.
You are a bingowing tantric master now.
Scorpio
PMS takes over
and your mood
swings are more
erratic than usual.
A few hours
after becoming a
vegetarian you start thinking cannibalism may
be a fun option and decide to go ahead and get
the t-shirt. You discover your brother actually
does not taste like chicken and your disgusting
hippie vegan ways take over once more.
Libra
You enjoy the oc-
casional expletion
of gas from the rear
end. You start ana-
lysing the frequency
as well as quality
and loudness levels of these little bouquets
of scented noise. You arrive at the conclusion
they are lenghtier, louder and floppier than
ever. You are actually a 56 year old man.
Sagittarius
You open all the
Chrismukkah
presents under the
poorly decorated
tree in your dingy
living room. You
discover your father bought your sister a
pitchfork which she has been instructed to
ram through your granny’s foot an average of
3 times a day. You are delighted at the thought
and will sell pictures of the process online.
Capricorn
.... Knock knock
knock... Who’s
there? ... Jonathan
Feverish-Anaconda
... Jonathan
Feverish-Anaconda
Who? ... Jonathan Feverish-Anaconda, I’m
going to rip out your throat and eat your
intestines for breakfast after sodomising your
mother.
Cancer
You feel a slight
pain around your
stomach and head
to the local bombed
out GP practice.
Dr Patel breaks the
news to you that due to excessive drinking
you now have a foie gras instead of a liver. In
desperation you enjoy a terrine of your own
tasty dandruff.
Gemini
This week you run
into a pine cone
the size of the
Statue of Liberty.
This experience is
a pleasurable one
and it gives you copious amounts of sensual
feelings. You fall in love and soon after become
Mrs. Pine Cone. Your kids are weird looking
and they get bullied at school for rubbing
against other students’ legs and purring.
Leo
Your next week will
be just like the rest
of your mediocre
life stuck in crappy
working class hell-
hole -- as uneventful
as a penis two days after circumcision surgery.
You will spend Saturday feeding stones to your
grandmother as she sleeps, because you like
the noises she makes as she chokes on them.
You like the smell after she coughs them out.
Taurus
As you shave your
girlfriend’s foot hair,
she tells you it’s not
really working out
and she was only
with you because
she likes the colour of your toenails. She
says it reminds her of the hue of the crunchy
peanutbutter she used to take to her dad while
he was in prison for selling drugs to kids, while
dressed as Jonathan Ross.
Aries
Sphincters. Sphinc-
ter is a perfectly
normal English
word that invokes
different sensations
and images in the
minds of the young and the ancient. Sphincter.
Say it twice. Sphincter, sphincter. It sounds
like an elementary particle. Whoever finds the
Sphincter wins the next Nobel Prize.
Pisces
The air conditioning
in your office stops
working and you
feel remarkably like
a paedophile in a Big
Bird suit. Your back
sweats profusely. You start enjoying the feeling
little bit too much. A few days later you are are
arrested for indecent and lewd behaviour in
Hyde Park. You take a liking to the police of-
ficer who takes you in and grope her hard.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
You undergo gene
therapy and some-
how your Y-Chro-
mosome is replaced
by an X-Chromo-
some. This leads to
a humongous blubbering vagina growing fast
on the end of your penis. Matty thinks it looks
like a tulip but Tom is likening the organic
transformation to a lion eating a rotten cu-
cumber. Sally thinks wahoo! doubleness.
