Thinking New Perspectives.
The whole point of doing an internship with Credit Suisse is to understand
what it’s really like to be part of our business. That’s why we treat you like
a colleague from day one – sharing in the same workload, meeting the same
challenges and celebrating the same successes. You will be responsible for
projects and tasks that matter to the business. You will grow in knowledge,
skills and confidence. And above all, you will experience the team spirit that
makes this bank such a special place to work. It’s no good reading about it
– you have to feel it for yourself. To find out more about internships and
placements with Credit Suisse, please visit our website.
