How have you found your first
term at Imperial?
It’s been reasonably enjoyable, but
there’s been loads of work!
How have you found the
workload?
There’s been a lot more than I
expected.
How have you found the Union?
Not bad. The food in Beit during
lunch hour is reasonably priced
but it could be better, ie: like
King’s College London Union
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
There’s a lot more work than other
universities. In general there’s
better facilities.
How have you found your first
term at Imperial?
Stressful! Okay, that’s a bit of
an exaggeration but still, there’s
always a lot of work to do.
Although there is still enough time
to have fun.
How have you found the
workload?
There can be a lot at times
especially in your department,
with lab reports, drawing
assignments and coursework
along with tutorial sheets. But, it’s
still quite (just) manageable.
How have you found the Union?
Cheap and it is good value.
However, it can get packed at
times – we need a bigger building.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
Amazingly, but the social life in
their’s seems so much better. At
least we have free admission to
our amazing gym (for now...)!
Imperial came 3rd in
August’s Good University
Guide, however it would
have come 1st if student
satisfaction was higher: did
you know about this? Does
this surprise you?
I had no idea about this and
it does quite surprise me. So
far I haven’t found anything
that bad. Overall I think us
students are treated well.
It could be to do with the
workload though!

How have you found your first
term at Imperial?
Great!
How have you found the
workload?
Busy. There’s been a lot of work
and it’s much harder than A-level.
How have you found the Union?
The food there is nice and the
prices are cheap.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
Imperial is a lot better than their
universities – no doubt.
Imperial came 3rd in
August’s Good University
Guide, however it would
have come 1st if student
satisfaction was higher: did
you know about this? Does
this surprise you?
After being here for a month I
am feeling like I’ve joined the
top university in the country
(world).
How have you found your first
term at Imperial?
It has been great and very
challenging.
How have you found the
workload?
Fine. It’s been easier than
I anticipated. Next term will
probably kill me though...
How have you found the Union?
The Union is bustling with life.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
Hmm... We are certainly a lot more
hard working and the social events
at Imperial are great. But I am
biased though!
Imperial came 3rd in August’s
Good University Guide,
however it would have come
1st if student satisfaction was
higher: did you know about
this? Does this surprise you?
I knew that a university as good
as Imperial had achieved 3rd
place. However, it is suprising
to find the reason for not
taking first place was due to
student satisfaction.
How have you found your first
term at Imperial?
It’s not been what I expected.
How have you found the
workload?
The work has been intense so far.
How have you found the Union?
Crap – The Union is in need of
some serious investment and
immediately. It closes too early as
well, but the food’s quite good.
I also feel that it’s not central
enough to students’ lives.
How does Imperial compare to
your friends’ universities?
Other universities don’t get
marked in their first year! This
means there’s no time to settle in.
Imperial came 3rd in
August’s Good University
Guide, however it would
have come 1st if student
satisfaction was higher: did
you know about this? Does
this surprise you?
I’m not surprised. Imperial is
really good for studying but
not socially. I’m going to get
a good degree out of it but it
would have been nice to get
the whole experience.
Imperial came 3rd in
August’s Good University

satisfaction was higher: did
you know about this? Does
this surprise you?
Yes, I found out about this
from a friend. I found it
somewhat surprising.
