xfam Unwrapped is a
campagn that has been
running since 2004. It
provides a selection
of gifts which can be
purchased by the public. This year, all
the proceeds from our Festive Fun-
draiser will go to Oxfam and this
campaign.
Gifts are carefully selected following
feedback from communities on what
is needed most to overcome poverty
and suffering. The impact gifts have
is monitored. Gifts, which range from
£6 to £1,700 can be purchased at www.
oxfamunwrapped.com, and in Oxfam
shops.
Felix hopes to be able to buy a range
of gifts with the money raised. Enter
our competition and not only could
you win the fab prizes but you’ll be
helping out many people as well. Here’s
a selection of gifts on offer:
Goat: £25
The goats only go where they will
thrive and to owners who will really
appriciate the extras that they pro-
vide - there’s fertiliser to spread, milk
to drink and sell, plus kids too. Goats,
bought locally, also give nomadic com-
munities a mobile source on income.
Build a Bog: £50
Oxfam provide the tools, training, the
labour - everything people need to
build their own disease-stopping con-
venience. Definately worth spending a
penny on!
Fertiliser: 125kg for £38
Amazing what you can do with a load
of old manure. Add in worms and a bit
of food wast, and you’ve got the per-
fect recipe for crop-boosting fertiliser -
helping communities grow loads more
fruit and veg to eat and sell.
Essential Medicines and Medical
Equipment: £100
Most places Oxfam work in don’t have
a local chemist that people can pop
into. That’s why even the most basic
medicines can make a big difference to
everyday life. This gift covers first-aid
kits sanitary kits and simple drugs that
can help a commnity health worker to
make someone’s life a lot better.
Reading Classes: £49
Give an adult who’s never been to
school the chance to learn to read
their chidren’s homework, their pre-
scriptions, a letter from a friend. This
gift wil also help promote the impor-
tance of learnng to read to even more
people.
A set of £15 Textbooks: £60
Textbooks are a great addition to a
community school and help countless
kids with their lessons. Its great for
teachers too! This could help start a
school library.
Teach a Teacher: £24
Thousands of children around the
world can’t wait to start learning - all
they need is a teacher. Their dreams
can be reality by training more teach-
ers and giving them the support they
need to do an even better job and in-
spire more children.
Please give generously to Felix’s Festive
Fundraiser, so that we can help others
whose Christmas might not be as fun
as ours. Felix wishes all of our readers a
very Merry Christmas and Happy New
Year!

who have been doing their
bit for charity, and especially
for Oxfam. The Links Club
from the City and Guilds
College (C&G), have also been getting
in the festive spirit and doing their bit
for charity.
This Thursday, the club made their
way to the Oxfam store on Glouces-
ter Road, picked up all the books they
store had to offer and made their way
back to college. They then split up into
teams, decided on their selling tech-
niques and began to sell, sell, sell.
Books were priced extremely mod-
erately at 50p a pop, or £2 for 5, and
all the proceeds went to Oxfam. By the
end of the day The Links Club man-
aged to raise £140, enough to buy 5.6
