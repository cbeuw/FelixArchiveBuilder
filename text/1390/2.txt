Time’s ticking for the
Queen’s Lawn marquee
The College’s planning permission for the marquee on Queen’s
Lawn expires on 16th December. The marquee, which has been up
for over half a year, will finally have to be taken down much to the
joy of students. Rumours that a bog-monster will emerge from the
muddy undergrowth are completely unfounded.
Creationism on Campus
Ahlul-Bayt society invited Dr. Babuna, representing Harun
Yahya, to speak on the evils of Darwinism and Atheism

On Monday 3rd December at 6pm
in the Clore Lecture Theatre, Huxley
Building, the Imperial College Islamic
Ahlul-Bayt society invited a speaker
from the Harun Yahya organisation to
talk about Darwinism. The event was
organised with the aim of encouraging
debate and discussion between those
with differing points-of-view on the
Evolution vs. Intelligent Design/Crea-
tionism debate.
The keynote speaker was a Dr Cevat
Babuna, a Turkish neurosurgeon and
devout Muslim. He spoke for over an
hour on the supposed evils and errors
of Darwinism before a questions and
answers session with the speaker took
place; this excited many into a fevered
discussion. Even after the questions
and answers session, many remained
to discuss what had taken place.
The event was well attended by those
of differing faiths and those with dif-
fering opinions on the matters of crea-
tion, which could be seen and heard in
the various reactions to the lecture and
debate afterwards.
Dr Babuna’s lecture began by dis-
cussing the evils of Social Darwinism
and linking Fascism, Nazism and Com-
munism directly to the supposed ‘law
of the nature’ that Darwin “preached”.
Many seemed outraged at these re-
marks, with the point made later that
anti-Semitism and Atheism existed
long before the publication of On
Natural Selection. It was clear from the
outset that Dr Babuna wanted to pro-
voke a reaction, and he was successful.
After discussing the negative effects
of Darwin’s Theory of Evolution on the
social sciences (which did exist, despite
Darwin’s protestation), more tradition-
al grounds for opposing Darwinism
were then explored, beginning with the
argument of irreducible complexity;
where in an organ such as the eye, if a
piece is removed it apparently cannot
function, claimed Dr Babuna. Since the
Theory of Evolution describes more
complex organs evolving from simpler
organs, irreducible complexity is an ar-
gument against Evolution; this was one
of the many arguments utilised to op-
pose Darwinism.
What made the lecture more inter-
esting is that it was a Muslim speaking
as opposed to an Evangelical Christian
who are traditionally associated with
the Intelligent Design cause. Because
of this, more debate was opened be-
tween differing creeds, whether they
agreed with Dr Babuna or not and
this produced a thought-provoking
evening. Whilst many were worried at
the fact that such views were expressed
at a science university, any worries that
students (both religious and non-reli-
gious alike) shared were quashed in the
aggressive questions asked in the ses-
sion following the lecture.
After the questions and answers ses-
sion, the air was cooled by the showing
of a video depicting suffering children
in Iraq; as the chair of Ahlul-Bayt of-
fered that despite differing views, eve-
ryone is united behind humanitarian
causes. Despite the nature of debate,
we are all still human.
