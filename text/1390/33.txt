Film
Can you last for the whole night?
To quote Peter Griffin, a philosopher
for our time, “You know what really
grinds my gears?”- Well, for me it is
when telling people about the Cinema
Winter All-Nighter (on the 11th of De-
cember) gets the following response:
“Oh, you’re the guys that show
films. How does that work – do you
show DVD’s?”
That really annoys me! What I tell
these people as well as anybody else
who happens to be walking within a
15m radius at the time (and if you’re
one of these people, I’m so sorry as
I tend to black out and wake up not
knowing what just happened) is that
the Cinema isn’t just some random
Union club with a digital projector
and a laptop. We have a Kinoton
35mm projector, a Dolby Digital EX
surround sound system and a team
of projectionists who spend their
time making up and breaking down
actual cinema film. We’re not “like
a cinema”; we are a cinema. Once
you get this point clear you begin
to realize how cool we actually are
(which is partly why I wrote this ar-
ticle – to seem a lot cooler). That’s
when all the amazing facts like that
we have the biggest screen in the
area and are probably in the top
ten screens in London seem all the
more impressive.
Obviously you can come along,
watch a film and be blown away by
our 33-foot screen but there is an-
other side the Cinema experience,
behind the scenes.
The Cinema is actually run as a
club in the Union and is controlled
by students, so when that movie
starts up remember there’s a rath-
er bored student sitting behind the
projector checking tensions, who
spent most of that week making up
the film and checking it for flaws.
Then there’s all the box office man-
agement, PR and a whole financial
circus that goes on to actually get
films on the screen. This lets regu-
lar students provide input into the
way the cinema is run including
which movies we show. We’re al-
ways looking for new staff in all ar-
eas and no previous experience is
necessary. It’s a great way to learn
about film.
After all that you should be com-
pletely convinced that the iCU Cin-
ema is the best place to watch film.
For those who aren’t, it’s also really
cheap. At £3 for one movie and £5
for two I dare you to find a better
deal. Really… try it!
So you’re dying to come to the cin-
ema now, I can see. But what will
wet your appetite for film? What
you need is a banquet of film. You
need the iCU Cinema Winter All-
Nighter. With six delicious courses
of film you’d be mad not to come,
well, unless you can’t handle it. Can
you handle it? Can you?!
