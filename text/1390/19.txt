Arts
The moon on the breast of the
new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to ob-
jects below.
When, what to my wondering
eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight
tiny reindeer.
With a little old driver, so lively
and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St
Nick.
More rapid than eagles his cours-
ers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted,
and called them by name!
“Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now,
Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on
Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top
of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away!
Dash away all!”
As dry leaves that before the wild
hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obsta-
cle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the cours-
ers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St
Nicholas too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard
on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each
little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was
turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas
came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his
head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished
with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on
his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just
opening his pack.
His eyes-how they twinkled! his
dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his
nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn
up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as
white as the snow.
The stump of a pipe he held tight
in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his
head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little
round belly,
That shook when he laughed,
like a bowlful of jelly!
He was chubby and plump, a
right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him,
in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of
his head,
Soon gave me to know I had
nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went
straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then
turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of
his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chim-
ney he rose!
He sprang to his sleigh, to his
team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the
down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ‘ere he
drove out of sight,
“Happy Christmas to all, and to
all a good-night!”
‘Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not
even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the
chimney with care,
In hopes that St Nicholas soon
would be there.
The children were nestled all
snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums
danced in their heads.
And mamma in her ‘kerchief, and
I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a
long winter’s nap.
When out on the lawn there arose
such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what
was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a
flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw
up the sash.
W
ith a suitably
seasonal theme,
we end this term
with a wonderful
poem by Ameri-
can poet Clement Clarke Moore. He
is best known for this poem, which
really gets you in the mood for a
good old session in front of a log
fire with a pan of mulled wine and a
thick, woolly jumper.
If you don’t know how to create
the nectar that is mulled wine, please
follow the recipe below;
Pour one bottle of red wine into
a large saucepan with 1 orange
(halved), 60g sugar, 1 cinnamon
stick, grated nutmeg and a dried bay
leaf.
Heat until the sugar has dis-
solved. Add more sugar if you want
it sweeter.
Take it off the heat and add 60 ml
gin, but only if you really want to…
this bit is optional!
Ladle into glasses/mugs/mouths
and enjoy.

‘Twas the night before printing, and all through the Felix office you could here the Arts Editor cursing at
the Stanzas page, fighting for some Christmas inspiration. This week: ‘Twas the night before Christmas
