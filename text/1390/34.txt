It’s (almost) CHRISTMAS!
I am ploughing the depths of my red sack to bring you 10 songs that make Christmas
that more Christmassy, especially if played at Christmas. Y’know, Christmas

C
hristmas is meant to be
a giving and caring time
of year and it probably
is. However, amongst all
the loving, giving and
caring, Christmas can be a lonely time
for those who are not recipients of all
the above. I dedicate my music page to
those who for every Christmas, there
are feelings of vulnerability, loneliness
and fear.
I know what you are thinking now:
“Isn’t Matty starting his festive page
with too much of a hint of depression?”
Well, if you are not a realist then yes, I
am being a bit heavy.
Everyone knows that Christmas is
really an excuse for people to get a
break from working so hard to be able
to afford to buy presents for that day
off. Such cyclical constructs plague our
year but I wouldn’t want Christmas
taken away from me.
Christians rightly want to put the
focus back on the day being about the
birth of Jesus Christ. Credit when it is
due, there would be no overdosing on
turkey if they didn’t take over a Pagan
festival and make it about a baby. To
those who are non-religious, how do
you put meaning back into the day?
Well, in my opinion I think Christmas
is there for us to reflect on how really
horrible we are as human beings and
we can take one day out of the year
and just generally ‘relax’ and not care if
your brother slept with your girlfriend
or your dog just ate your granddad’s
Cartier watch (that was a tough year).
Also, in the spirit of reflection we then
convince ourselves we will be better
people next year. So in essence, the fes-
tive season is about self-loathing and
hope; hope that we one day will not
loathe ourselves. So when you are out
Christmas shopping, have a little think
about that and STOP GETTING IN
MY FUCKING WAY!
Anyway, music, ain’t it swell? I think
swell is a great word and people should
use it more often. So, I decided to jump
on the bandwagon (have you ever seen
a bandwagon?) and list my top 10
Christmas songs, but I avoided the
obvious Slade and Cliff Richard aim-
ing more for songs that have represent
the emotional impact that Noel has;
the songs represent being lonely on
Christmas, desperation to resolve bad
relationships for the sake of the joy-
ous season, vulnerability and the pain
of nostalgia. It is all very well scream-
ing, “It’s CHRISTMASSSSSSSSSSS!”
But at the end you are an unchanged
human being. A great Christmas song
should make you realise how fragile
human relationships are and that we
are really nothing and all we have is our
time together. Well, that’s what I think
anyway.
If you do one thing this Christmas,
make sure you tell someone who you
feel about them; whether it is a hobo
you trip over on Christmas Eve or your
significant other, or perhaps even your
parents, someone needs to know that
you are nothing without them. Lastly, I
wish you all a very merry Christmas.

Wham!
Last Christmas
This song is very much an American
phenomenon and is probably not that
well-known over here but it is my fa-
vourite Christmas song.
It considers of an insistent repetition
of “Christmas” moving up through the
chords whilst Darlene sings over the
top with an urgent, desperate melan-
choly. The only thing that saves the
song from collapsing in a hopeless mess
is a saxophone solo which sprouts into
existence around three quarters of the
way in.
The one thing that makes this song so
irresistable is the Phil Spector produc-
tion (I know he is trigger happy but he
can sure construct a wall of pure joy-
ous sound). LIberal use of sleigh-bells
may seem incredibly cliche, but since
Spector used an immense amount
of percussion on everything it
only serves the song well.
You will be jumping up and
down to the starkest and most
mournful lyrics around.
More of an obvious choice, this. How-
ever, even if you are not a fan of tradi-
tional Irish folk being fused with punk,
you can relate to this ballad. This song
is basically the musical version of Req-
uiem For A Dream but with a waltz-
time backing; it starts with hope and
the American Dream and the dream
ends in a haze of addiction and self-
destruction. How this became such a
huge hit is probably due to its epic and
swaying quality rather than its devo-
tion to realism.
Somehow it is not properly Christ-
mas without this song being piped out
of every supermarket, pub and mobile
phone. I’m sure those who are fans of
irony will somehow enjoy (if people
who rejoice in irony do enjoy anything)
how one of the biggest Christmas an-
thems is about the destruction of all
that is good and full of hope in the
world. I think this song is very much
how fragile and vulnerable everybody
is and everyone can relate to that.
“Well, tonight thank God it’s them in-
stead of youuuuuuu!” Bono memora-
bly wailed whilst 30 bad haircuts stood
around ‘changing the world’ the cynic
in you might say. Regardless of how
you stand with regards to the hideous
sight of 80s pop stars becoming philan-
thropists for a day, you can appreciate
that in the Muslim majority of Africa,
there will be no Christmas.
What I think this song really rep-
resents is the death of Christmas
as belonging to the Victorian age of
moralism. The 80s became about in-
dividualism, materialism and aesthet-
ics and Band Aid were trying to delve
back into the heart of man to come out
and help those who need it; a worthy
cause by any means. However, by mak-
ing Christmas a world-wide event by
applying it Africa, they destroyed the
cosy image of the Victorian Christmas
and showed that the only good spend-
ing money can do is if it helps others.
BeforeEiffel65camealongandclaimed
the colour blue in the name of Euro-
pop, blue used to mean something.
Aside from originally representing the
hardships that the freed slaves endured
in an economically unstable time, blue
was something everybody could unite
around: a feeling of melancholy whilst
something out of your control was
keeping you that way.
In the case of Mr. Presley, his lady
friend’s departure is what kept him
down and stopped him from enjoy-
ing the season. Despite the warmth of
the reds and greens of Christmas, that
other primary colour, blue is all he can
see. I particularly enjoy this simple im-
agery, because loss is a simple idea that
so many of us can unite behind and re-
flect on our own blue holidays.
Whilst technically not a song about
Christmas, it was still a Christmas
number one and that is the only justifi-
cation that I need. Whilst being a typi-
cally cheesey song from another boy
band, I actually think the melody of the
verse is very poignant. Also, it shows
that no matter how hard the exterior,
we can all feel hurt and longing, espe-
cially in the Winter season. That and
you can croon this whilst drunk.
What I find extraordinary about this
song is the fact that it was put out
about 20 years after the sound they
exhibit was fashionable. Despite this
being a Christmas song that
Elvis should have performed,
its cartoonish nature does
not completely detract from
the timeless issue of being
lonely at Christmas. I think
to put this song
in any more of a
modern setting
would destroy
the warmth of
the song.
I know you
are think-
ing that
the
spoken
word bit
is pure cheese,
and to some extent, I
agree, the years of listening to awful in-
die bands has hardened me. However,
those ‘bum bum bum’s just thaw out
any residing inner icicles.
Nostalgia is a pretty crippling thing,
you grow tired of anything new because
you feel alienated by these new move-
ments that have no bearing on your
way of life. When I listening to Bing,
I hear not a yearning for snow, but an
end to his isolation from modernism
and a return to the Christmases he
used to know.
I also personally feel a certain
amount of nostalgia to the Christ-
mases of my childhood where all
my brothers would be there before
they all went off and got married
or involved.
To many this song is wishful
thinking since it never snows,
but it is more an appeal to
our inner child.
Wham!’s sing-along classic
is about deception and resentment
whilst coming off as quite remote,
possibly to avoid George Michael’s
hidden homosexuality by being gender
specific. This song more than anything
deals with vulnerability associated
with the true gifts that we exchange at
Christmas ie. that human-Dalek mask
I want.
This song superficially deals with a
myth in the form of Santa but really
deals in fear and judgement. It also
deals with coming of age and reaching
beyond your black and white child-like
vision of reality. This man, whether it is
Santa or God is the ultimate judge and
he knows whether you have been evil
or good and will reward you accord-
ingly. Once you realise that life is not
that simple, this song becomes a joke
or novelty.
EveryonetellsmethisisthebestChrist-
mas song, but I don’t agree in any way.
In terms of vocal performance. Ma-
riah can sing and she likes to let you
know about it, but is so professionally
executed she just sounds like a shop-
ping centre. I literally think of shop-
ping centres when I hear this song. It
is unavoidable for me to hear anything
else and what is very melancholy about
this song is how vacuous
it is. Songs like this re-
duce Christmas to a
nothing and that is
depressing.
