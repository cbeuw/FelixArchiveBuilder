The opening minutes of the match
didn’t go in IC’s favour with Plug let-
ting one in through his feet within the
first two minutes, and Sid and Krusty
both missing an open goal. However
Diana sorted this out by scoring only 5
minutes in to level the score. IC picked
up their game, with Shipman skilfully
defending one of the many aerials and
D.R. defending well despite the funny
running. IC were awarded a short
corner in which an awesome goal was
disallowed.
This was one of many short corners
that IC failed to capitalise on. Kingston
were trying their hardest with players
randomly diving into the air just in
case it would help. It didn’t. IC lead the
attack but Kingston swiftly reversed
this, worrying Foetus and leading to
shocking tackles for which Shipman
got reprimanded but not tossed off.
Mountie called for the team to calm
down, but no one seemed to listen.
Kingston managed to get another past
Plug, but luckily this was disallowed,
we have no idea why. IC got attacking
again but this time Krusty got angry
with the umpires luckily only getting a
green card.
This didn’t deter IC but clearly pissed
off Kingston who took down Diana in
the D leading to a penalty stroke being
awarded. The tension was high but Di-
ana was in control putting another past
the keeper, this stroke was on par with
Dominator’s score a few weeks previ-
ously. IC were once again in the lead.
Dyke piped up from the sideline that
all gingers were good at sport which
was demonstrated by Paedo and Skull
F*ck, who created another chance for
Krusty leading to yet another IC goal.
Kingston got angry and not only
started lobbing the ball into the IC
spectators but got Shipman so angry
that he fouled in the 25 to give away
a short corner. He is a bit of a drama
queen and stayed stuck to the floor,
probably expecting a yellow card, but
oddly the umpires just gave him an-
other reprimand. Shipman redeemed
himself by defending the corner.
IC then took the worst ever 16 yard
hit out as Plug needed to dive to save
Shipman from potentially scoring an
own goal. The half time whistle blew
and the half time comments weren’t
inspirational with D.R. saying “for f**ks
sake” and Stumpy saying “I’m as bored
as f**k”. Clearly something wasn’t right
in the IC camp, so Paedo did his best at
buttering up the umpire.
Krusty’s half time talk must have
been inspirational as IC came out
fired up. There was great penetration
down the left hand side with Krusty
to Mountie to Diana to Sid to Stumpy
before finding the target leading to an-
other IC goal. Dominator continued to
chant “run Stumpy run” at any given
opportunity. Mountie decided diving
was called for but actually missed the
ball and D.R. got involved in a bit of
argy-bargy and the small boy fell over.
Tensions continued to rise with
Krusty and the Kingston number 3 be-
ing spoken to and the Kingston 7 get-
ting a green card. Note at this point
Nugget has his hands down his pants
“just checking that they were still
there”. It wasn’t that cold up at the For-
tress…Stumpy once again claimed he
was bored but the defence were work-
ing hard especially as they kept giving
away short corners, and Kingston final-
ly scored another. The Kingston 7 got a
yellow card but did appologise for his
Men’s 1 win then shamelessly plug new calendar
bad tackle. How kind of him. Stumpy
decided to do some running claiming
“I’m going to touch it now” and after
some dopey dopey do with Krusty they
gained another short corner. Alex hasd
his drag flick saved but they got an-
other short, this time Diana took it and
hit home, scoring a hat-trick; the first
fresher hat-trick of the season.

Foetus, Sid and Stumpy worked hard
and fast to score another IC goal. King-
ston tried to get back in the game once
number 7 had been allowed back on.
D.R. took a needless swing at Stumpy’s
tackle before doing a stylish dive to get
the ball back. Shipman got beaten by
a nifty little flick. However it made no
difference when the final whistle blew.
The post match comments were few
and far between with Mountie being
too involved in PDAs and D.R. claim-
ing “it was no Friedrichshafen”. The
umpires failed to comment.
The team rounded off the match
with a team photo posing with the
front cover of the ICHC 2008 Calen-
dar. This is on sale now from Hockey
Club members, just in case you were
wondering.
Is that some sort of naked hockey calendar that they’re holding there?
