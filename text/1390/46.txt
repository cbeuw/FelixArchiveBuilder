The importance of water
Gil Saville
Energia Fitness Instructor
Sports league
Water is crucial for us to remain
healthy and alive, but all too often it
is taken for granted as to why it is so
important and to what extent it helps
us perform better in exercise. Water is
the second most important element to
life, after oxygen. The body can survive
for weeks without food but only days
without water, and often for a lot less
in warm temperatures and high alti-
tudes. The body and all its organs are
comprised mainly of water; making the
average person about 60-75% water.
Water is essential to all bodily func-
tions. It aids our digestive system with
the absorption of nutrients, it’s in-
volved in the regulation of body tem-
perature and blood circulation, it helps
in the transport of nutrients and oxy-
gen to cells and removes waste prod-
ucts from the body. Alongside these
functions, water also helps to reduce
wear on joints providing lubrication
and cushioning, including the spinal
cord. Without sufficient water supply
(dehydration) we open up our bodies
to all kinds of problems. Dehydration
can lead to hypertension, asthma, al-
lergies and migraines.
The main function of water is its
role in regulating our temperature. We
generate heat when we train and there
are numerous mechanisms which the
body calls upon to lose heat. Obviously
the surrounding environment plays a
role, but sweating is a significant meth-
od of cooling. The evaporation of fluid
from the skin is very effective. During
prolonged exercise it is possible to lose
as much as two litres of sweat per hour.
This would be ideal in keeping us cool,
but unfortunately not all sweat evapo-
rates, as some drips off the skin and is
wasted.
Fluid loss, even as little as 2% of body
weight, can seriously impair the ca-
pacity to perform muscular work. In
temperate climates, most athletes lose
1-5% of body weight in prolonged ex-
ercise, even when taking regular fluid
throughout.
Water transports oxygen, nutrients,
hormones and antibodies through the
blood stream and lymphatic system
(used to fight cancer, viruses, bacte-
ria and infections). This is obviously
important to us as we push our bod-
ies hard in the gym and by doing so we
greatly increase the amount of water
that our body excretes. When we are
dehydrated, our immune system is
therefore open to invasion from out-
side entities and we are more suscepti-
ble to the attack. Good hydration helps
to protect us from this.
Brain tissue is 85% water, and it uses
a twentieth of the body’s blood supply.
When you are dehydrated you have
less water in the blood. This can reduce
brain functions, and cause fatigue, de-
pression or stress. It can also lead to
migraines, which may be indicators of
poor body temperature regulation.
Muscle is 75% water, so it is impor-
tant that a high water level is main-
tained in order to prevent muscular
dehydration. When muscles become
dehydrated they are open to possible
loss of strength and cramps. Cramps
are muscular spasms where a muscle
contracts abnormally and locks into an
awkward position. Although the direct
cause of cramps remains unknown, it
is known that muscles that are over-
worked, injured or exposed to extreme
temperatures are more likely to suc-
cumb to cramp. Water helps to regu-
late our body temperature and aids in
the transport of nutrients to cells, so by
increasing water intake we can reduce
the risk of cramps.
Water is also a lubricant for the
joints and the cartilage between the
vertebrae and at the end of long bones
at synovial joints there is also a signifi-
cant amount of water. Cartilage needs
to be well-hydrated as this prevents
abrasive damage occurring when the
opposing surfaces of the cartilage make
contact with each other. Long term in-
adequately hydrated joints can lead to
friction damage resulting in joint dete-
rioration and pain.
Another reason why water is impor-
tant is due to the fact that when we
dehydrate, our body’s solution loses
viscosity,whichinturnreducestheeffi-
ciency of the protein and enzyme func-
tions of the body. So when we are try-
ing to increase our protein absorption,
water is vital, as acids and enzymes in
the stomach will break food down into
a more fluid state as part of the diges-
tion process. Lack of fluid means you
will not be able to break down the food
as easily and efficiently.
Water is also fundamental with re-
gards to strength. Being slightly de-
hydrated will reduce a muscle’s lifting
capability, and training when in this
state will reduce the strength gains that
you might normally get. If you can’t lift
as much as when you are adequately
hydrated, then how can you expect to
push harder and make gains?
Water can also be one of the most
useful tools for losing weight. Water is
calorie-free so when you are on a re-
stricted diet, drinking water can help
fill you up and alleviate some of the
hunger.
Since I was away last week, and I forgot
to mention to anyone in the office to
do the league table, we’re a week be-
hind. Sorry guys. And since I’ve strug-
gled to get all the results, we’re gonna
be another week behind. Do not fear,
however, as it is the last issue of term
and so I’ll have the whole winter holi-
days to get the table up to date.
Like I mentioned in my editorial,
from next term I will include all the
medical clubs out there so that we can
get a clear picture as to which team is
doing the best across the college. For
this to work, it does mean that you guys
are going to have to get those results in
on time to the Sports Partnership peo-
ple (a.ayling@imperial.ac.uk).
This week, I thought I’d show how
the clubs have been doing as a whole.
As we can see the Imperial Rugby Club
are top of the table with 67 points. At
this point I want to point out that the
scoring system is the same as it was
before i.e. the ranking of the teams is
based on the Felix Index (FI), which
is calculated as follows: FI = (W*5) +
(D*2) – (L*4).
Rooted bottom of the table are the
Medicasl Rugby, who have had a rath-
er dissapointing start, altough it does
seem as though their ‘Great Escape”
has begun.
Meanwhile, the top of the table is
dominated by Imperial sports clubs,
with the first medical entry being the
netball club at 11th place.
This league table will appear again
at the end of next term, so things can
change.
