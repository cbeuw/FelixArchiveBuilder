With any luck this will be my last rant
about the National Union of Students
until the spring. After a long day and a
cramped journey home in the Imperial
College Union funbus on behalf of
our nine delegates I am delighted to
report that we got our own way at NUS
Extraordinary Conference in Leicester
on Tuesday. Conference overwhelmingly
voted in favour of the proposed changes
to the NUS constitution and Imperial’s
proposed amendment which means that
student trustees will be democratically
elected instead of just going through an
appointment process.
Our delegates left this event fully
aware of why it is vital that the current
structures are scrapped. On Tuesday
we spent a ridiculous amount of time
debating procedure rather than the
substance of the governance review
and if the new constitution passes
the NUS will move away from the
arcane, overly formalised process of
submitting and discussing motions to
something a bit more accessible to
ordinary students. As I have previously
stated, the new arrangements whereby
all financial responsibility rests with a
small, highly skilled Board of Governors
should prevent the waste and general
silliness that came about from having a
bunch of 27 highly politicised students
on the National Executive Committee
taking some very important decisions.
I mentioned in my speech against the
wrecking amendment submitted by
Manchester Students’ Union titled
“Save NUS Democracy” that it was
fairly absurd that the organisation
currently spends more money on the
decision making process than it does on
campaigning. Having lots of meetings
is no doubt terribly fun for the sad
old hacks like me who would end up
attending them but probably isn’t that
great for the average student who just
wants to see that NUS get on with doing
stuff that is relevant to them.
To draw this matter to a close for now,
speaking from the point of view of
someone who thought it was a waste
of our time, effort and money affiliating
to what is currently a fairly ridiculous
organisation it was humbling to hear
one of their
Vice Presidents
describe the NUS
as a “bankrupt,
shambolic farce”
that “lacks
influence.” The
NUS leadership
have kindly
written a
disaffiliation campaign for Union’s like
Imperial who would be very unhappy
should the reforms fail and I am
happy to take that as evidence of their
commitment to sort themselves out. If
you have got this far (NUS governance
is a bit drab… yawn..) have a very happy
Christmas break and I look forward to
seeing you in 2008.

NUS Extraordinary Conference
As the Centenary Year draws to a
close Imperial College Union has
finally completed its search for a
compelling and profound New Years
Resolution. After a long summer
of compiling evidence to create an
impressive document detailing Fairtrade
Products, events and publicity on the
Imperial College Campus the Fairtrade
Foundation has announced last week
that we were successful in our bid for
Fairtrade University Status. Having got
involved in the campaign for Fairtrade
on our Campuses at Freshers’ Fair in
my first year I think this is the biggest
achievement that I have made as an
Imperial College Student and something
the College and its students should be
really proud of for making it happen.
Over the past eight years considerable
pressure has been placed on the College
from Student Campaigners to increase
its Fairtrade offering. Recognised as ULU
Student Campaign Group of the Year
in 2006, the Fairtrade Campaign Group
went on to form the Fairtrade Society
in 2007. In the same year the Fairtrade
Steering Group, a joint collaboration
between Imperial College London and
Imperial College Union, was formed
and the Union and College both passed
new policies stating their intentions to
promote and support Fairtrade on our
Campus.
Fairtrade University Status is a mark of
recognition for the efforts of the College
and Students’ Union to promote and
support Fairtrade Products. By becoming
a Fairtrade University we will be able to
improve social and cultural awareness
amongst staff and students and highlight
the way in which our actions can affect
the standard of living for a wide variety
of people all over the world. Imperial
College Graduates, as the World
Leaders of tomorrow, have a wide social
responsibility to support high standards
of ethical and environmental influences
in future global trading. The importance
of such matters becoming more and
more evident in the choices made by
consumers, prospective students and
businesses all over the world.
The demand for Ethical Products on
campus is high, with over 1.6 million
Fairtrade Hot Beverages being served in
the past year. Imperial College Union’s
new range of Fairtrade Hoodies and
T-shirts have been flying off the shelves,
with the colours, designs and quality
of the garments exceeding everyone’s
expectations. Having achieved Fairtrade
Status in such a short period of time,
the Fairtrade Society and the Union are
turning their efforts towards the Borough
of Westminster and the City of London,
to help in their campaigns for Fairtrade
Status.
It is particularly fitting that Imperial
College has received this long awaited
recognition during its Centenary Year.
With new environmental initiatives being
implemented and these positive steps
in social responsibility and awareness
Imperial is finally closing the gap with
its competitors and is no longer lagging
behind on important global issues. It is
a great cause for celebration and will
send a positive message to our dynamic
multi-cultural society, our prospective
students, graduate employers and the
government.
Positively Red SHAG Week
Last week saw one of the most
energetic and vibrant campaigns to
hit Imperial College Campus in recent
memory. Collaboration between Imperial
College Union, Medsin, Sexpression
and Positively Red led to a huge array
of events and
activities raising
awareness about
Sexual Health and
fundraising for
AIDs Charities:
Children with
AIDs (CWAC) and
Positively Heath
UK (POSH). Stalls
on the Sherfield
Walkway and in
the Sir Alexander Flemming Building
sold tshirts, ribbons and gave out free
SHAG Bags with sexual health goodies
and advice to nearly 1000 students. The
flash mob on Upper Dalby Court and
the events in the Union were also well
attended with approximately 100 people
turning out to watch professional Pole
Dancers and party with Ann Summers
last Friday night. Well done to everyone
who stopped by to find out more about
SHAG Week, wore their red ribbons with
pride and took part in our events. You
have helped raise hundreds of pounds
for these vital charities. Special thanks
go to Hannah Theodorou for keeping
everything together and to Li-Fay,
Victoria, Leoni, Sam and Jamie for all
their hard work.
