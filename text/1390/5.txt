IC can’t get no satisfaction?
Felix interviews the Dean of Students and the students themselves to discuss university satisfaction
Tom Roberts
& Andrew Somerville
This week Felix conducted interviews
with the student body and the newly
appointed Dean of Students, Professor
David Lloyd-Smith, to find out about
what new students feel about their first
term at Imperial College. Prompted
by results from the National Student
Survey (NSS) released in August 2007
in which Imperial was ranked 68th for
student satisfaction, and the influence
that this has on the Good University
Guide, the investigation was designed
to give the new students a way to voice
their first opinions of College after only
a few months of exposure.
Over 25 first year Imperial students
were asked to fill out a survey which
posed questions about how they have
found their first term, including:
workload, halls life, their experiences
with the Union and the College, and
how the Imperial compares with their
friends’ universities. Students were
also told about the Good University
Guide results in which Imperial would
have ranked first had it not been for
poor student satisfaction, instead fin-
ishing third overall, and asked about
their reaction.
The students’ responses are on the
following pages. Due to space issues,
not everyone surveyed made publica-
tion. It was decided to select people
whose opinions reflected views that
were popularly found, and whose an-
swers were well reasoned. Similarly,
there were more questions asked than
could be published; those chosen to
make the final article were picked to re-
flect the most important and most in-
teresting issues covered by the survey.
Felix also interviewed Professor
Lloyd-Smith to ask him about his new
job, the newly created position: Dean
of Students, how it relates to students,
his aims and the issue of student satis-
faction. The question and answer tran-
scription follows below.
These student interviews are not
comprehensive. They were conducted
mainly on a Wednesday afternoon (a
day when many students are not in
College) around campus, in the Union
and also in a hall of residence.
Judging from the people that Felix
spoke to, there seems to be a common
consensus that students have to work
very hard at Imperial. Opinion over
the social side of university is divided,
however the students mostly remain
pleased that they have come to Impe-
rial with nearly everyone stating that
they would choose Imperial again,
with hindsight.
The results are surprisingly positive
compared to what the National Student
Survey suggests. One thing to note is
that Felix only surveyed first year stu-
dents this time around, whereas the
NSS was based on responses from final
year students. Are the results positive
because we’ve only interviewed fresh-
ers who haven’t experienced the entire
year, including the stresses of exams, or
has the College improved so vastly in
the previous few months that students
are more satisfied than before?
Felix is interested to see whether
these opinions change over the course
of their studies, so tune in this time
next term when we’ll be conducting
more surveys to find out just how sat-
isfied Imperial’s student body is.
However, before we get to the stu-
dents’ views, the Question & Answer
session with the new Dean of Students
follows.
The recently appointed Dean of Students, Professor David Lloyd-Smith
What’s does the new role of Dean
of Students entail?
The position has been newly created
over the summer. Effectively, the duty
of the old Pro-Rector (Educational
Quality) have been divided into two.
It was felt that this Pro-Rector posi-
tion needed to be reconfigured, so it
was much better to separate it into two
jobs.
The current Pro-Rector (Educational
Quality) is responsible for strategic
thinking and the quality of our educa-
tion program whereas my role as Dean
of Students is focussed towards welfare
and pastoral care. I oversee the College
tutors and hall wardens, help student
councillors deal with problems when
they arise, sort out issues to do with
disabled students and I have a wider
involvement with things that might af-
fect students at Imperial, such as gov-
ernment policy changes.
Before the creation of the Dean of
Students position all of these tasks
were tackled by the Pro-Rector (Educa-
tional Quality). The division of duties
has freed up the current Pro-Rector to
focus on building up the strategic edu-
cation that needs to be enhanced.
What’s currently on your Agenda?
I think I’m very largely still trying to
find out what Rees Rawlings [the previ-
ous Pro-Rector (Educational Quality)]
did and what the job’s all about.
What are your ambitions for the
role?
I thought we had a very good system
under Rees Rawlings and I think he
put an enormous effort into ensuring
that students enjoyed life at Imperial
College on all aspects from sporting
activities to cultural ones, to ensur-
ing the quality of courses here were
high for students. I think he left a very
good legacy but one cannot be com-
placent about the things – they need
maintaining.
At the moment we are shifting our fo-
cus here and there depending on what’s
going on at the time. For instance, we
are being driven by statutory instru-
ments to comply with the governments
changing disabilities acts.
Another serious problem presented
to us at the moment is with under-18
students. We have more than ever be-
fore and they all be in halls or living at
home. Wardens are under extra pres-
sure when these students are residents
in their halls and I’m here to offer extra
help.
Is your appointment directly
related to the creation of the new
Student Hub?
I think that the Student Hun is a notion
of centralising all of the key student
support services – a one-stop shop.
Although it’s to do with Welfare as a
place where there is a group of people
who can be relied on to provide the
majority of answers to students’ ques-
tions, I wouldn’t say my role is involved
with it directly: it’s more of a national
trend that has occurred at universities.
What is the mechanism you use
to monitor what students feel
about their university experience?
Do you use SOLE?
SOLE is primarily used for academic
purposes and quality assurance. But it
also has the facility to try to deal a bit
more widely with the student experi-
ence, particularly with first year stu-
dents who we would like to get a bit
more evidence about.
If SOLE is not operating efficiently
then we will consider how to modify
it with better questions. It is a system
that seems to be flexible to be amend-
ed as we see fit.
Other mechanisms include student
liaison officers who report back to us
after finding out what is going on in
the various courses and also the na-
tional questionnaire that students fill
out from which we get information on
the student experience from those who
completed the survey [NSS].
Earlier you said that you believe
under the current system you
have been left a good legacy of
making sure that students’ wel-
fare is in a good condition – how
do you think this is reflected in
the student satisfaction survey?
The results have been quite poor
for Imperial. For instance, in the
Good University Guide Imperial
would be top if it wasn’t for the
poor satisfaction of students –
surely that is slightly worrying?
My experience is that the students I
deal with seem to be focussed on their
reason for being at Imperial College
which is to study science, technology,
medicine, to get a good degree and to
get a good job as a result of that. Dis-
satisfaction with the quality of educa-
tion received here doesn’t seem to be
high, in my view.
So the dissatisfaction you’re turning
your attention to may be to do with
cultural life at the College, with extra-
mural experiences and sports activites.
I’m not sure though: when you look at
sport here with the massive new sports
centre and also the highest proportion
of sporting activity in the UK, it’s diffi-
cult for me to understand why students
feel that the student experience at Im-
perial is that much less than at other
universities.
Myself and Rees Rawlings are and
have been constantly talking to stu-
dents to find out how they’re enjoying
life at Imperial.
Certainly we are trying to find out
why it’s happening. It could be that at
that time of year [when students have
to take SOLE] they get fed up taking
questionnaires. Perhaps taking two
things like this is maybe causing some
difficulty. I’m afraid I can’t answer the
question though to be honest with you
as I’m new to the job.
Do you think that the workload
at Imperial is preventing students
from doing activities outside of
their studies?
It’s a very interesting question and it
depends what you want to compare it
with. If you compare it with European
institutions on the continent you would
have to say the student workload in the
UK is much less. For example, students
in France spend 39 to 40 weeks, not 30
weeks, as we do, on their study activi-
ties. People who go there expect to get
a good job and I think that people who
come to Imperial also have to expect
to work hard because the profit from
doing so is immense. If you graduate
with a degree from Imperial it has a
high caché, it has good value and you
can turn it to many things such as get-
ting a good job or going on to another
university such as by doing a PhD at
Cambridge. Employers respect a de-
gree from here.
In Germany students work for a min-
imum of five years to get their diploma
and they work all year round.
Should we be comparing our-
selves with European universities
or ones from the UK?
We feel that we measure ourselves
against the best continental universi-
ties and institutions across the world.
We want to measure ourselves against
those that are most highly rated and
so the workloads in general have to
be proportional with the quality
of the degree, the quality of the
whole experience and its value
of turning it into a job or a
position at another uni-
versity. Students who
come here, by and
large, know what
they are get-
ting them-
selves
into.
