Grooving With

Ummagununa
Pink Floyd
Harvest (EMI)
A double LP at the low
price of 57/6, this consists of
one record recorded live at
two separate performances
and the other recorded in the
studio, complete with effects,
electronic and otherwise.
The live album has two
tracks per side, each about
ten minutes long. The best are
Astronomy Domine and Sau-
cerful of Secrets; ithe first,
composed by the group's for-
mer lead guitarist Syd Bar-
ret, is a nervous, jerky, rhy-
thmic song to music that
continually ebbs and flows in
volume, while ' Saucerful'
gradually builds up to a cli-
max, lessens, them goes in
crescendo to a finale which
has to be heard to be appre-
ciated.
The studio album is much
less appealing on the first
hearing; each member of the
group seems to have been
given a free hand to do what
he wanted for ten minutes,
which is all very well, and
some very interesting music
is produced, but tracks like
Several Species of Small
Furry Animals Gathered To-
gether and Grooving With a
Pict will appeal to a very spe-
cialised group of Floyd ad-
mirers.

This the second LP to be
produced this year by this

very good without being out-
standing, while others are just
the regular derivative rock

What is this thing religion?
At least two things as far
as I can see. There is the Re-
ligion of the established
churches, the Christian Reli-
gion, Mohammedan Religion
etc., which have been formal-
ised so that they are accept-
able to a large number of
people because within their
dogma, there is such a free-
dom that one can pick and
choose one's own way
through them. Then there is
religion best defined, I think,
as that which is manifested
in the individual's spritual re-
lationship to his environment.
The first involves a belief in
the dogma of the particular
religion, the second the belief
in whatever the believer holds
to be of import. The com-
mon factor in both of these
cording these days. Certainly
the group has improved im-
measurably since the day of
last year's Albert Hall Ents.
concert, when they opened
the first half of the show. So
listen to it and you may
like it.
Four Sail
Love, Transatlantic
Apart from the atrocious
title, this LP is good value
for money. Love seems to be
built around the musical tal-
ents of Arthur Lee, who com-
poses most of their work and
plays various different instru-
ments. Again, most of the
music is simple blues and
rock without originality
showing itself to any degree,
but there is always an audi-
ence for just that. After all,
think how many groups
started in just that way, and
are now experimenting in the
misnamed "underground".
The predominance of Lee's
musicality in Love's music
brings you to wonder just
how many groups suffer from
the same defect. Certainly,
Pete Townshend, Winwood,
Keith Emerson of the Nice,
and to a lesser extent, Jag-
ger and Lennon, all contri-
buted the major amount to
their group's work, and, with
the Floyds' L.P. in mind
again, you are caused to won-
der just how much Syd Bar-
rett's composing talents were
responsible for the group's
early success.

is the belief; that is, the
acceptance of something as
true; which by extension in-
volves the introduction of the
beliefs in the believer's store
of knowledge.
Why is it necessary to go
through the rigmarole of reli-
gion merely to get to this
stage of accepting something
as true, and therefore usable
as a day to day criterion for
action? Historically, religion
(and Religion) were used to
explain the things superna-
tural which could not be ra-
tionally understood. As the
supernatural is a dynamic
concept more suited to ex-
planation by today's science
than by religion, this role is
of diminishing importance.
However, one reason for
belief which is still important
is the need for mental secur-
"Naturally", by Fat Mat-
tress, who have been to IC
this term, has a very catchy
and distinctive guitar se-
quence predominating. Gen-
erally fast, loud and good.
"The World's An Apple"
by Big Bertha featuring (sic)
Ace Keiford, sounds like a re-
hash of "Natural Born
Bugie" by Humble Pie. The
similarity really is quite
noticeable. However as "Nat-
ural Born Bugie" was a good
record, I liked this one also.
Lastly and leastly was
"Pretty Girl Why", by Buf-
falo Springfield. A pleasant
sound but not particularly
special.

LSE : The Natives are

Paul Hoch & Vic Sehoenbach
Sheed & Ward : 10s.
This book has been written
and published in the mini-
mum possible time in an all-
out effort by the publishers
to get it on the book-stands
before LSE fades in our
minds. The result is what one
would expect as far as the
book's composition goes, with
subscripts to every page,
quotes from all and sundry
scattered throughout the text,
and occasional passages
where one is led to believe
that whoever was carefully
subediting away all the

ity, ithe meed to know some-
thing. I'm almost tempted to
say anything, on which one's
spiritual existence can be
based. Many people meed this
in the same way that people
need the physical security of
job, family, established soci-
ety with all its conventions,
etc. It is perhaps the need for
certainty im a world where
nothing is certain â€” do you
know 'that the sum is going to
come up tomorrow ?
Further, in pursuit of hap-
piness there is always a clash
between the national dements
and the emotional elements
in Us. This clash can be les-
sened if there is something
the intellect cam accept to be;
on this basis it could perhaps
resolve the oomfliot which
occurs whan the emotions de-
mand answers while the ra-
tional 'person knows there are
none.
How, you may say, do
these vast generalities relate
to my religious beliefs, which
is what this article is sup-
posed to be about. Very
simply. You see, I believe all
the above. And you will
notice that this belief effect-
ively serves me as a religion.
For, while on rational
grounds, the only tenet I
accept is the contradiction "If
I know one thing it is that I
know nothing". I believe im

and my belief is firm enough
to keep me happy, which (I
believe) is the end point of
my belief.

authors' wilder comments
and ideas, missed.
All this could obscure the
fact that a greater part of the
book is a factual, day-by-day
account of the sit-ins, occu-
pations, strikes and marches
organised by the active mem-
bers of LSE. It stresses that
all the much-publicised tak-
ing down of gates, forming of
picket-lines and invasion of
LSE staff facilities was not
just the action of a small ac-
tive group of foreign agita-
tors, but the result of long
Union discussion. A l l the
attempts to defy the govern-
ing bodies of the school were
passed by large majorities at
Union meetings, where, inci-
dentally, they get a hell of a
lot more people turning up
than they do here.
It's biased, of course, Hoch
and Schoenbach being proud
members of the "foreign
scum" refusing to be down-
trodden by disciplinarian
attitude of Adams and Co.,
but it's not too one-sided to
stop you seeing that this isn't
just a lot of students causing
trouble for the sake of caus-
ing trouble. It overwhelm-
ingly points out time and
time again the fantastic anti-
student bias that exists in the
press and in the minds of the
older generations, and it does
this by quoting excerpts from
the Dailies (you can guess
which ones), and f r o m
speeches made by MPs and
industrial heads.
The bias is something
everyone knows about, it's
caused by lack of communi-
cation, which is easy to say
but seemingly impossible to
do anything about. Through-
out the book you are assailed
by the complete inability of
any of the protagonists to see
any point of view other than
their own.
The Natives are Restless is
the first report on this sub-
ject to put forward a concise
account of what the students
did and why they did it, and
it's worth reading for that
alone, but it also lets you see
just what the "agitators"
thought they were fighting
for.
INFORMATION
FUN AND GAMES
The Institute of Contemporary Arts situated in The Mall
has a comprehensive programme of films, exhibitions, plays
and concerts throughout the year. The Union has a block
membership and you can get a membership card on produc-
tion of your registration card in the Union office. This will
enable you to buy rickets at much reduced prices.
Replacing the John Heartfield exhibition from 28th Nov-
ember will be Play Orbit, an exhibition which explores vari-
ous aspects of toys. It includes giant games, toys for adults
and one toy each from over a hundred artists. The exhibition
runs until after Christmas, 11 a.m. - 7 p.m. daily; admission
4s. for members (that's you).
RECORDS
Discount on records can be obtained at Mascall Records in
S. Kensington on production of your registration card. Stu-
dent discount is also available at the record stall in Kensing-
ton Market, Kensington High Street. In fact, there are a few
stalls in the market which give discount so it's worth asking
if you're shopping there.
CLOTHES
Vast sums of money aren't required to provide a costume
for Carnival or to infuse a bit of variety into the traditional
students' modes of dress. Here are a few ideas:
Jumble Sales provide a surprisingly wide range of clothing.
You can get shirts, trousers, vests and jackets for 6d. to 1/-.
White or light coloured clothes can be dyed very cheaply
with dye obtainable from any hardware shop. East End mar-
kets like Petticoat Lane usually have second-hand and sur-
plus stalls; all it needs is a good eye and some imagination.
There are second-hand clothes shops and stalls in Portobello
Road Market and also two shops in nearby Pembridge
Road selling old theatrical clothes.
DUPLICATING
The Union duplicating equipment can be used by any mem-
ber of the Union. If you need any duplicating done see Jon
Moont in 415 Tizard, who can supply materials. The dyeline
machine in the union cloakroom is also available for doing
posters, if you supply your own materials, bought from the
bookshop. See Deputy President Pete Earl (Beit Hall) for
details.
