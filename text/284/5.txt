A Proclamation
Citizens of the Imperial Empire, greetings, may the love
of all things red keep and preserve you!
Let it be known to one and all that the Emperor Caesar
Red is not pleased with his subjects. It has been noted by
his Imperial Majesty that there has been reactionary voting
in the Imperial people's meetings. This he commands to
cease!
Let citizen Torr be an example; his name has been
removed from the CEFE mailing list, for reactionary voting.
This terrible fate will fall upon all those who oppose our
beloved and deified leader.
Let it be known henceforth that all leftist motions passed
by inquorate meetings of the peoples will be passed to the
Imperial Senate, as if the meeting had been quorate. This
will be known as "democracy", and those who challenge
the quorum will be known as the "Union bar/Rugby Club
clique".
Let it be known that on XXVII November MCMLXLX
a lounge suit will consist of a mauve sweater and very
battered jeans. The Emperor wishes it to be known that he
commands more respect than the Queen, but because of
his unparalleled and god-like politeness he will allow the
Queen to open the new Imperial Palace.
The Emperor warns the Bost: his infinite patience will
soon end. Their knowledge of the Universe gained over
many years is nothing, compared to the knowledge of our
most beloved leader. They must cease their reactionary
thinking and accept the words of the Emperor.
His august Majesty proclaims that this month's deity
(after himself) will be: MAO, god of mobs and god of
bloody carnage. He reminds us that when divine retribution
comes from above, it will have the symbols CCCP neatly
lettered, in red, on its side.

Lyon Playfair Library
(continued from page 2)
In the basement, Level 0, theses are stored. This part of
the library is not, however, completed yet.
There is an Xerox machine down here, and the charge is
the standard 6d. per sheet, with reduction to 4d. per sheet for
copying of theses of 300 sheets or more.
Photocopying equipment will be installed shortly, and then
the library will be able to produce slides, etc.
The micro-readers in the basement will be most useful for
reading theses and other papers sent to the library from other
places (particularly theses from America) in microfilm form.
The old books deposited eight years ago in the UL deposi-
tory at Egham have been brought back, and these also are
on Level 0. Some of these volumes are of more historical
than academic interest!
Film Soc. Travel
Lastly, it cannot be stressed too much that the new library
facilities are very much under-used. There must be many
people in digs who could use the 500 work spaces in the
evenings. The best way to keep abreast of the latest scientific
discoveries is to read the periodicals in that field, and what
better way to follow up a subject than to look at the original
papers? The periodicals section caters for both of these. The
Restricted Loans section stocks all the recommended books,
and you are almost certain of being able to see a copy.
The library is there for you to use—use it.

Film Soc could be the
answer to built-in obsole-
scene in the cinema — access
to all those vast libraries of
great old movies—so, who
heard of television? — can't
beat the big screen and pic-
ture quality of film — so
they're having the projectors
serviced at Christmas, aren't
they?
There is now a movement
of over 600 Film Societies in
Great Britain. Its 100,000
members are disciples of the
principle of furthering the
appreciation and use of the
film medium, with the implic-
ation that this an art form of
serious intellectual merit,
supported by such periodicals
as 'Film' and 'Sight and
Sound' and a vast body of
critical and adulatory prose
in many types of published
literature.
In fact 'Film' is a medium
which caters for all intellec-
tual levels (Q. Is John Len-
non's erection an intellectual
edifice?) and which can be
utilised in any economic sys-
tem for a myriad of purposes.
To be good a film should
make you laugh, cry, or
sit bolt upright in your
seat, involve your mind
with the thought of man's
intelligence behind it
(did anybody see 'Tar-
gets'?). We think the feature
films we're showing this year
are good; you might not have
recognised yourself as a dis-
ciple hitherto, but if you
come to see one then join the
club.
One of the disadvantages
of Film Soc is the passive
nature of 'film appreciation'
and the lack of contact be-
tween audience and organis-
ation, a lack of the feeling of
belonging to a society. To
bridge the gap we are plan-
ning to make available short
films next term which can be
used for spontaneous Film
Soc meetings, and we hope
there will be some sort of
happening anyway on the
Fridays between feature
shows. You don't need to be
passive, call us we won't call
you, and remember brothers,
you too can walk on the
water.

Get Away From It AH —
Travel I.C.
Going places this year?
Sheffield, Skopje, Sydney,
Singapore, Sweden, South
Carolina? Did you know you
can get student reductions on
travel to all these places and
millions more? If you didn't,
you are, to put it in student
language, a mug!
Or do you think you know
everything? "Sure, I do —
N.U.S. do everything at the
cheapest rates" — well you've
got something to learn as well
— at the time of writing
N.U.S. can only better us on
cheap student train fares in
Britain and by the time you
read this article, maybe even
that slight oversight on our
part will be amended. Very
soon we might be the cheap-
est travel bureau in Great
Britain — we are still debat-
ing whether to give our 5%
on all your bookings back to
you or to use it for publicity
—if everybody in I.C. reads
this then there will be no
problem !
One more question — do
you know what G.S.T.S.,
B.U.N.A.C., E.S.U., and
I.A.E.S.T.E., to name but a
few, stand for? If so, you've
wasted your time with this
article — you've dealt with us
before and know we hang
out in Committee Room D,
next to the Main Union
Lounge in the New College
Block, on Mondays (12.30-
1.45) and Thursdays (1.00-
2.15). If you didn't know,
well you do now — come
and find out the cheapest way
to get around and abroad
(hitch hiking hints!). Or if
you are in an ultra-tremen-
dous hurry to book that flight
to Siberia, call along to Lin-
stead 517.

Communicate
Very often at IC, people say
they know nothing about the
Union, and don't wish to
know anything. They say that
the Union doesn't do any-
thing for them except, may-
be, finance their clubs.
Perhaps they don't realise
that the Union also allocates
parking places, that it can
help them borrow money, and
assist in many welfare prob-
lems.
The floor reps, want to do
their bit to help the cause of
'communication'. On three
lunchtimes a week they will
be in or around the Union
office. Anyone with queries,
criticisms, advice, or com-
ment of any nature please go
along to the Union Office.
The floor reps, will be pre-
sent from 1 to 2 p.m. on
Mondays, Thursdays and Fri-
days.
