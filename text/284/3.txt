Inverted Racialism ?
Co-ordinated Diversification

Dear Sir,
In response to the very reasonable expressed desire of
students in the College, many departments have introduced
non-scientific subjects into their undergraduate curricula.
However, the result makes one very suspicious that it is a
stop-gap action to placate a current trend. It might also
have been a conspiracy to convince students at Imperial
College that non-technical subjects are not worth studying.
Having spent the last three years as an Electrical Engin-
eering undergraduate, I regret the prosaic inclusion of non-
technical studies in the syllabus. The status of liberal
studies increases from a virtual non-existence in the first
year to a total of one, two, or three subjects (as the student
chooses) in the final year. Surely, the reverse order, with
a wider range of non-scientific subjects read in the initial
part of the course, will be more appropriate in introducing
the fresher to engineering.
Balanced
Most, if not all, students come to I.C. to benefit from
its specialised training. Some also come to be educated, and
it is not Mephistophelean to gently persuade the rest that a
well-balanced education is congenial.
To develop an imaginative liberal studies programme in
engineering faculties requires care, consideration and com-
petence. Ludicrous combinations, such as parallel courses
in Twentieth Century Literature and Modern Drama, should
clearly be avoided (assuming that Pulitzer Prize aspirants
will not have drifted into our company).
The worth of an introductory economics course in an
engineering curriculum is generally acknowledged. But,
final year engineering students cannot be expected to be
enthused by a course based ashamedly on a first year or
perhaps Pre-University) test for economics students. Not
surprisingly, the attendance on the economics course during
the last session fell very noticeably as the year progressed;
most of the remaining students depended on that subject
to satisfy course requirements.
Similar tales of woe beset all studies non-technical.. De-
partmental lieutenants do not appear to dignify these
subjects with much care or attention, even while they swear
an equivalent weighting of these subjects with their tech-
nical counterparts in the final assessment.
Dangers
Surely, I.C. cannot afford to retrogress in a day and age
in which the dangers of overspecialization are consistently
emphasised.
The solution is obvious, even if it is not simple. Taking
the cue from the establishment of an Industrial Sociology
unit it is not unreasonable to expect the creation of a
department to co-ordinate the liberal studies programme in
the various faculties of the College.
The task of providing non-scientific studies in the coun-
try's leading technological institute should not be under-
estimated. It has to be executed profesionaily and efficiently,
so that those who seek to acquire scientific and engineering
skills of the highest quality in Ithe context of a balanced
education do not have to go west.
Yours sincerely,
A. H. S. Loh (CCA.)
No Need For Bar
Dear Felix,
So the student houses are going to be 'anonymous con-
glomerations of cheap rooms' unless facilities for the sale
of alehoholic drinks are provided. (Felicity correspondent
from Mining House). Is the level of personality of the
people in these places so low that they cannot be sociable
without the aid of a depressant drug ? Is it true that the
only social community they experience is when they all puke
communally on the floor?
Shame.
However, rather than allow this state of affairs to persist,
I suggest that the Chemistry dept. produce sufficient quantity
of LSD and give it to these people so that they can either
decide to communicate on a more human level or jump
off Colcutt's tower.
Yours expectantly,
Doctor K.

Capitalism
Defended
Sir,
A few days ago, I noticed
a number of leaflets around
College publicising 'Captive
Nations Week'. When I had
recovered from the shock of
seeing a leaflet which was
not published by Piers
Corbyn, I was intrigued by
the figures on the back of
the leaflet. These added up
to the astounding total of
nearly 100 million deal as
a result of the application
of Marxist-Leninist ideo-
logy — making the late and
unlamented Herr Hitler look
like an amateur!
The leaflet warns us
against indifference and
apathy, the very malaise
which must have struck this
college last year, when I.C.
chose to be run (overrun?)
by those lovers of top-heavy
bureaucracy, the left wing.
It is about time that we
realised the dangers of
allowing ourselves to swing
too rapidly towards social-
ism. A great difficulty lies
in the fact that the most
publicised of a socialist's
views are good humanitarian
principles with which most
of us agree. The dan-
gerous part of his views is
that his Utopia will be ach-
ieved by a sudden revolution,
which will tear down the es-
tablishment and replace it
with an all - powerful
'people's state'.
An often overlooked ad-
vantage of capitalism is that
it allows a far greater free-
dom of speech and move-
ment. In a capitalist state
no one group ever gains
complete control, there is a
continuous struggle for sup-
remacy within the upper
reaches of society, with the
state but one faction among
many, and no group can get
in the position to impose its
own ideas and suppress
others. This is greatly to the
benefit of the 'lower classes'
who gain a relatively large
amount of real power.
Under socialism, the
'upper class' consists of one
group, the state, which is
free to impose its views
upon the rest of society by
any means, usually violent,
as we can see from the 19
million deaths in Soviet lab-
our camps between 1921
and 1960.
The stated principles of
the left (equality, etc.) are
not undesirable, it is only
their way of imposing them
which is unwise. It is (or
should be) the job of the
moderates and the right
wing to keep a check on the
childishly impatient left, and
to slow them down so that
we may ultimately achieve
an equilibrium to the bene-
fit of the whole of society.

Dear Sir,
During this term IC Union
and ULU have been trying to
fight racial discrimination in
Lodgings, and now against
higher hall fees for overseas
students. The only people
who benefit from these ac-
tions are the overseas stu-
dents, as far as I can see,
and many of them have
volubly argued their case in
the Union.
When I myself queried the
place of overseas students in
IC (see FELIX number 281,
page 3), many British stud-
ents in IC rallied in opposi-
tion, talking about "integra-
tion" and "intellectual cross-
pollination". It appears,
then, that British students
have been doing their best to
promote integration. Some
even wish to demonstrate
against higher Hall fees, risk-
ing legal action.
Personally, I would not ex-
pect the overseas students to
try and prevent this integra-
tion, but on Friday, 7th Nov-
ember, the Overseas Students
Committee held a party in
Weeks Hall.
What did the notice say ?
"Overseas Students only"!
This advert was an insult
to ULU and ICU. Should we
British members of the Union
be told we are not accept-
able? We can fight discrimin-
ation against overseas stud-
ents, but we must be discrim-
inated against ourselves. This
is insulting ingratitude!
The person or persons res-
ponsible should either apolo-
gise, or, if he has the nerve,
justify this action in these
pages. I imagine that some of
the overseas students them-
selves were likewise horrified
at the offending notice, and I
would urge them to set up an
enquiry into this. How can
we fight external racism if
we have this sort of behav-
iour internally ?
Until a satisfactory apol-
ogy or explanation is re-
ceived, IC Union should re-
frain from discussing the
problems of O/S students. If
we are not good enough for
their social acceptance, they
must indeed be superior
enough to fight their own
battles! George X
Revolution On Jrelix
Dear Editor,
Having read Mr. Cyril
Smith's comments in Felix
on "The Coming Revolu-
tion", I would like to point
out the utter hypocrisy
which runs through the con-
versation. The key quote in
it is thus:
"For us our principles are
scientific principles, and we
wouldn't bend them for any-
body".
The quotation by Mr.
Smith denotes the fundamen-
tals of Stalinism, which he
so laboriously condemns.
The fact that he considers
his scientific principles to be
more important than people
("we wouldn't bend them for
ANYBODY"), typifies the
totally inhuman and bureau-
cratic nature of Stalinism,
and sets him well on the road
to Fascism. What on earth
makes him think that be-
cause he has stuck Trotsky
on to the end of his list of
gods. Marx and Lenin, that
he is fighting for a social
system that would be any
less bureaucratic and in-
human than that the Russian
revolution has obtained? I
would have thought that if
anyone wants to be a poli-
tician, they should be obses-
sed with the desire to give
people a free and happy life,
and not be obsessed with
imposing their "scientific
principles" on society.
Yours sincerely,
John Thomason,
Chairman Political
Societies Council.
Dear Sir,
Felix became established
as a newspaper wmcn pre-
sented news and features in
a tactual B.tJC type man-
ner. With me rise of the
Constituent College news-
sheets it became apparent
tnat there were two types of
papers—one which reported
news in a chatty style, often
intermingled with the re-
porter's views; and there
was Felix. The newsheets
were able to get away with
this because they were up to
date, didn't cost much, and
were regarded by the 'es-
tablishment' as a transient
'thing'.
But in the last issue of
Felix, the style of reporting
had degenerated to that of
the newsheets, yet most of
the material was one or two
weeks out of date. In short
Felix had become nothing
more than a very expensive,
very well printed and very
out of date newsheet for
ICU—and if this is what
Felix is to remain then the
annual grant of £800 can-
not be justified.
Trying to compete with
the newsheets on their own
ground would be suicide for
Felix, and to do away with
Felix would be a grave mis-
take. There is room for the
two types of paper; the
newsheets with their up-to-
date conversational tone and
pictures of octopuses, and
Felix which should (and
must) present news and
features in detail in a factual
and unbiased manner.
In this way, perhaps we
can both get along together
without any slamming.
Direct competition would be
folly, but the occasional prod
and overlap is beneficial to
both.

N.U.S. Debate
Criticised
Dear Sir,
We and others present at
today's Union meeting,
where it was decided to join
N.U.S., would like to ex-
press regret that a decision
which affects the whole of
the college union was taken
at a meeting where less than
a tenth of the union was
present.
Whilst we appreciate the
reasons for joining the
N.U.S., we disapprove
strongly of the manner in
in which this decision was
made. As this was an ;
ssue
affecting every member of
the union, we feel that more
of an effort should have
been made to present the
case fairly to every student;
instead of having a chair-
man clearly seen to be biased
and lack of information
from the opposition,
s We therefore sincerely
hope that in the future a
referendum will be taken on
any equally important issue.
Yours faithfully,
S. P. Cooke

Dissassociation
Dear Sir,
After recovering some-
what from the uncontroll-
able bouts of laughter cau-
sed after reading Colcutt's
column in your last issue, I
feel I really must clear up
one point for the benefit of
our judicious 'overseer'. John
Darley is a soccer player,
a good one by some ac-
counts (he was captain of
last year's 1st XI) — he
never has been a member
of the Rugby Club and.
after his 'performance' in
the R.C.S, Sevens, I hope
never will be a member. In
fact the R.F.C. just could not
tolerate having such a react-
ionary, right-wing fascist as
J.D. amongst them — no,
not for all the rats in Queen's
Tower!
