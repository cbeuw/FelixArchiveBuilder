One-sided Debate
The debate at the last Union meeting which took I.C.
into NUS was far too one-sided for such a major decision.
On the one side there was Dave Wield, quoting extensively
from a speech made the previous week by NUS president
Jack Straw, ably supported by some fine rhetoric from Les
Ebdon, and if this wasn't enough there was Dave Logan
from the NUS to answer questions and, in the process, pro-
viding a number of fine points in favour of joining NUS. On
the other side were just three short speeches from Ken
Barker, Dermott Corr, and Gwyn Hughes.
One of the points made by the proposers was that we
should join NUS to be able to take part in the policy
making decisions, and over the long term, to see that these
policies come to fruition. David Logan emphasised that the
NUS cannot bring about changes overnight, but suggested
that it was constant pressure brought to bear on the Univer-
sity authorities that brought results. If, then, ICU is to gain
anything from joining the National Union (except for the
travel concessions, the importance of which was played]
down by all three proposers) we must remain a member for
a considerable period.
This brings me back to my original premise — that the
debate was pushed through the Union far too quickly. The
majority of those who voted against the motion at the
Union meeting did so not because they were anti-NUS, but
because they felt that (a) as there had not been enough public
discussion before the debate, (b) the proposers were in such a
strong position as compared to the opposition that they
could play down their weaker points such as the cost of
joining, the cost of sending delegates to the bi-annual meet-
ing of delegates and in fact the effectiveness of 4 delegates
from IC amongst over 300 in all.
The motion having been pushed through so quickly, there
may well be a backlash from those who were not even
aware the NUS vote was being taken, and they could rightly
include in their argument that the Union has been used by
the pro-NUS contingent in alliance with President Corbyn.
Out-dated Posters
There seems to be a reluctance on the part of some club
publicity officers to remove posters immediately after the
event being publicised. This is not only true of those placed
on notice boards, but more importantly those placed around
other places in college. The Debating Society, for example,
still (at the time of writing) have posters advertising their
meeting on Tuesday, November 11th on every landing in
Linstead Hall. So wake up publicity officers, it is nice to
see adverts for events, but not when they are a week out
of date.

Piece
3 Fields
The Union has clear poli-
cies in 3 important fields:
Diversification, Representa-
tion and the Architectural
Association merger, and
wants early statements from
the administration on them.
Following Councils' (Nov.
10) discussion of the present
situation, which reinforced
what I have been saying to
the Admin, for some weeks,
I wrote a letter to the Rec-
tor (see elsewhere in Felix)
concerning the Nov. 12th
Board of Studies meeting.
The main subject of discus-
sion at the Nov. 12 special
meeting was the A.A. The
BOSt was asked by the
Union to discuss our ideas
on the A . A . and hence
also representation.
The A.A. negotiations are
now at a crucial stage, as is
revealed by some surrepti-
tiously obtained documents
yet we are excluded from
discussions.
A special meeting of the
Deans Committee was called
after the Nov. 12 BOSt meet-
ings the results of which
should be conveyed to
JURGO on Monday 17th
and the Union meeting on
Thursday 20.
Diversification
the BOSt to set up a diver-
sification — co-ordination
committee (as reported in
this week's (!) I.C. news.)
The report implies that the
decision is something to do
with the Nov. 12th BOSt
which it is not!
Anyway, confusion apart,
we are still waiting to be rep-
resented on this committee.
We will re-state that a cen-
tral college organisation is
vitally needed — a co-ordin-
ating committee which works
within existing resources is
just not enough!
Well, what is stopping the
administration going for-
ward at full speed on diver-
sification and representation?
Government reports, stud-
ents, many staff and a good
number of admin are all in
favour.
The great difficulty I had
in obtaining the minutes of
the special June meeting of
the BOSt which discussed
last years representation re-
quests, and the ghastly "dis-
cussion" which took place
there, gives the answer.
Backward looking Profes-
sors and department heads
form a strong vocal group
on the BOSt, the progressives
do not speak out.

It is typical of the left-wing at IC that they should have
the nerve to purloin the minutes of the June BOSt meeting
and then make it public, these are matters far above the
concern of average students. On reading my copy, I find
myself in total agreement with those staff who spoke against
representation especially Professor Chain when he said that
there could never be equality between "Masters and Dis-
ciples", that the whole affair was just political muck-raking
and that the staff should not give in to these marijuana-
crazed, poetry-writing, sandal-wearing, orange-juice drinking,
sissy, long-haired thugs as "appeasement never pays".
Whilst on the subject, I wonder if the College Authorities
are aware of what took place in the RCS Union office last
Wednesday: Henry (Heroin Experience and Nude Romps for
Youth), the College excuse for mass drug and sex orgies,
put on a so-called Sensory Adventure. Never have I seen
anything so obscene as the 40 people leaving, smiling and
being friendly to each other, obviously under the influence
of drugs as I saw nothing to be amused about.
True to the so-called "democracy" of the left, last years
referendum was totally ignored and a Union Meeting passed
a motion for joining NUS. Once again IC will become part
of the "mass student movement" which gives students such
a bad name and it could force IC to lose its reputation as
the most forward-loking and well-behaved College in the
country.
Whilst on the subject of money, coming up at today's
Union meeting is a motion to investigate links of IC with
racist regimes and companies who provide money for us.
Surely we can trust our academic superiors, the administra-
tion, to make sure of the moral consequences of our finances.

acts) and the F and E can
instruct the BOSt. Have the
Rector and the other mem-
bers of the F and E got the
courage to stand up to the
"Backward-lookers" and in-
struct the BOSt on our "3
fields"? They meet on Fri.
21, they could decide then!
What can we
do?
The Admin fear adverse
publicity and the Queen has
the power to change I.C.'s
Royal Charter. It is for these
reasons that council suggest-
ed that we should (if neces-
sary) petition the Queen and
issue a public statement on
Nov. 27. This moderate pro-
position is not anti-monar-
chist but the best attempt we
can make to fulfilling Union
policy. You must come to the
UGM today to discuss it, and
decide what to say to the
F and E.
N.U.S.
Well . . . we've joined.
Apart from LEAs paying
for the benefits we already
got we can get further posi-
tive help from NUS on for
instance: information, confer-
ences, Union 'demands',
Sabbatical year, legal advice,
competitions, etc. This is a
step forward!
Some people say there was
not enough discussion on
NUS. Well, discussion has
been going on since last year
— the people who don't want
us to join were always quite
free to protest more discus-
sion — they knew NUS
would come up! I even
asked some of them to write
an anti-NUS piece for a leaf-
let with a Same length pro-
NUS piece — they didn't —
instead they say we shouldn't
have joined because there
hasn't been enough discus-
sion. That is an easier way
out hardly valid. Anyone
can start a discussion!
A lot of people still
haven't got their Handbooks,
Bluebooks, USK Broad-
sheets and U L U cards —
come to the Union office and
fetch them when you fetch
your Union Directory.
Refectories-Ugh Next Issue
An operation research
study is urgently needed. If
the refectory committee con-
tinues to be obstructive,
council suggests a food strike
— this is probably the only
answer — discuss at the
Union meeting.
The Union and college
could be far more socially
useful and relevant to every-
body. A working group is
being set up to do things —
report at the Union meeting.
The next issue of Felix
will contain, amongst other
things, an article by the
President of the A.A. on at-
titudes to I.C., a feature on
Jazz Expo 69 and a special
Christmas surprise. Order
your Felix now so as not to
be disappointed.
