Last F r i d a y night I went t o the Presidents* B o l l a t ULU, Among those present were
•he Queen Mother and a l s o H e r s Corbyn, who was wearing l i g h t blue jeans, f l o p p y jumper, and
t a t t y s c a r f (not even I C ) , i n d i r e c t contrast t o the evening dress that everyone e l s e were.
Now I agree w i t h quite a l o t of P i e r s Corbyn's l e f t i s h views, b u t I t h i n k a strong
c w p l a i n t i s needed about c u r P r e s i d e n t ' s a t t i r e a t such a f u n c t i o n . I f he doesn't agree w i t h
formal functions and t h e i r formal wear, then he shouldn't go to them,
Perhaps Mr.Corbyn thinks a show o f protest i s necessary, b u t s u r e l y h i s a c t i o n does
him, and I C , no good a » a l l , and c e r t a i n l y c o u l d do a l o t of ham,,
