IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION NO. 284 20th NOVEMBER, 1969 6(1.
Out of Isolation
I.G.U. Votes to Rejoin N.U.S.
Did You Know?
At the first Union Meet-
ing to toe held in the new
Great Hall in College Block,
indeed the first massed
gathering in that noble
place, the Union voted in
favour of rejoining the Na-
tional Union of Students
after an absence of thirteen
years.
The meeting opened nor-
mally, late. Mr. Seaford
apologised humbly that there
were no carpets to place our
dainty feet upon, and hoped
we would excuse the in-
efficiency of I.C's adminis-
tration and himself in not
having the place ready for
us.
According to Ken Weale's
financial report, I.C. union
is technically in the red, to
the tune of £900, but this
was offset by investments of
£1,620, and Mr. Weale
thinks the Union should just
get by this year.
Dave Wield proposed the
motion that I.C.U. rejoin
N.U.S. His arguments, he
admitted, were much the
same as Jack Straw (N.U.S.
president) gave at I.C, a
fortnight ago (see page ten
for a fuller report). Piers
asked for someone to speak
against the motion. No one
stirred. Disbelief among old
hands at I.C., for this peren-
nial motion has provided
grist to the mill of I.C. de-
baters for donkeys years.
Ken Barker spoke. He
didn't, he said, really want
to speak against the motion
but he thought more time
should be devoted to con-
sider such items as cost,
feelings of other colleges
not in N.U.S. For Mr. Bar-
ker this was no matter to be
treated lightly.
Les Ebdon obviously
thought this poor stuff and
girding his loins strode
across to the microphone.
More time, Les said, but
we've been bandying this
idea about for thirteen years.
Cost? Anthony Crosland
himself, in his halcyon days
as Minister of Education
gave an assurance at an I.C.
general studies lecture that
joining N.U.S. would be a
valid reason for an increase
in Union fees. Sailing on in
full command of his subject,
other bogies were laid to
rest without anybody even
raising them. Participation,
student unrest, the student
image. Only through being
members of a national union
could I.C. Union make an
impression on national stu-
dent affairs such as these.
Blasting away through the
amazing acoustics of the
Great Hall Les entreated the
Union to join N.U.S. again.
Gwyn Hughes was un-
affected, in his opinion join-
ing N.U.S. would double the
workload of council, and,
quoth he, Who would listen
to Corbyn anyway at an
N.U.S. conference.
David Logan, of N.U.S.
executive give his views to
the meeting and pertinent
questions directed at him
from the floor drew lucid
replies. Someone asked if
N.U.S. can do anything
more concrete than demon-
strate? Nobody ever gets
everything he asks for said
Mr. Logan. How big a voice
would I.C. have in N.U.S.?
Mr. Logan said that college
representatives control N.U.S.
through a proportional re-
presentation scheme of dele-
gates with voting rights.
N.U.S.'s achievements rolled
freely from Mr. Logan's
lips, but the Union was
wary. Dennis Taylor even
more so. He asked if four
hundred students at a Union
meeting could accurately re-
flect the feelings of the whole
of Imperial College on this
issue. A deep question which
drew a deep reply from
David Logan on the use of
democratic structures, They
exist for people to use and
if an insufficient number of
people use the system then
government must continue
in the absence of interest.
Someone sneakily asked
about last years unfavour-
able referendum on joining
N.U.S. Irrelevant, said Mike
Green, if people had wanted
to come and vote, they
would have done so.
The sands of time were
running out as two thirty
approached. Dave Wield
summed up, Mr. Guy asked
if visitors would stand uo
and be counted. So the pre-
sident of the A.A. and Chris
Walmsley, president of U.C.,
stood up and were deftly
counted. The vote was 192
for, 143 against and 7 ab-
stentions.
Piers applied for member-
ship last Monday, and mem-
bership should be ratified
soon.
This years' Carnival is for
the Society for Mentally
Handicapped Children and
Carnival has already col-
lected some money ! ? Guilds
is doing phenomenally well,
having collected more than
£270, including £150 from
the Lord Mayor's Show and
most of the rest at the
Guilds - Mines terrifying
tiddly - winks tournament.
R.C.S. also did well out of
the crazy conkering in the
King's Road. R.C.S. netted
more than £100 from a
pedestrian speed trap there
to total £210. Mines has also
collected about £53 !
It seems that carnival can
raise a lot of money collect-
ing at such events and
there is no reason for not
enjoying yourself at the
same time, so how about
supporting the Trad Jazz
Group busking in High
Street Ken. on 22nd. of
November. This, plus last
weekend's bed-race to South-
ampton and the three legged
pub crawl provide devious
forms of entertainment for
anyone with enough energy
to lift a collecting tin in one
hand and a beer in the other.
This term's Carnival Week
is from 28th of November
to 6th of December and
seems to be well supported
by feet, with the round Bri-
tain hitch-hiking race start-
ing on 28th November, and
the Carnival Walk start-
ing between eleven and mid-
night on the 5th of Decem-
ber. Those arriving back
sore of foot and parched of
thirst will be greeted by girls
of Maria Assumpta bearing
breakfasts. A Darts Mara-
thon is also among events
proposed for that week so
what about volunteers from
the Union Bar.
A successful Albert Hall
Concert will be the main fea-
ture of next term's Carnival
Week, followed by a fete.
The Rag Mag will also be
on sale then, so if we have
any volunteers for salesmen
in Outer Bongolia . . .
In a special effort to have
all the Carnival Committee
fail their exams, these and
other events will be carried
on continuously throughout
the year, so I hope you'll en-
joy yourself participating,
especially with the help of
all the Corbynian USK Col-
leges who are putting in a
lot of work.

pretty, intelligent, stunning
girls only 5 minutes away
from I.C. and what are we
doing ? NOTHING.
President Linda Jackson
complains that the lack of
men ruins social life. I.C.
Halls, bars clubs and so-
cieties take note because
this is your chance to wake
up and live ! Invite the girls
to join. Our arts magazine
Phoenix tried the personal
approach and now has
articles, sales girls and
typists galore. The Drama
group needs male actors and
advisors together with bi-sex
football, hockey, pub-crawl-
ing is being organised by the
social secretary Jaquie Crisp.
There is also a dance on the
5th December with the Con-
sortium and Discotheque.

Francais between South Ken.
