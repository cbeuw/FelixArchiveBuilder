Consider the S o c i e t i e s . Each one of I . C 's numerous s o c i e t i e s has an important r o l e
to play i n corporate c o l l e g e l i f e and they are undoubtably the biggest influence on I . C .
Consider the unions. Every union i s short of people to take us i n t o the 70's w i t h
confidence. New ideas are alt/ays welcome i n t h i s f i e l d .
So, .
" r . Wood, I hope you understand a b i t b e t t e r now how d e s t r u c t i v e your a t t i t u d e
i s to the whole c o l l e g e . You are enjoying a l l the benefitd and opportunities of your
presence here and a l l you r e t u r n i s b i t t e r c y n i c i s n , aimed at destroying and r u i n i n g the
s o c i a l l i v e s of every student here. I suggest you reconsider your p o s i t i o n , concentrating
on the more constructive ideas a v a i l a b l e and act accordingly. Peter Lewis.

the boat crews to be excepted," This motion was passed nen con.
I n h i s p r e s i d e n t ' s r e p o r t , Butty mentioned the apparent delay by the relevant union
o f f i c i a l s i n doing anything about the standard of food at c o l l e g e . He suggested that d i r e c t
a c t i o n might be c a l l e d f o r e v e n t u a l l y . Presumably t h i s would bo i n the form of a boycott.
On a more humorous note, a n o t i o n was passed to the effect that the Theta bearers

A s u c c e s s f u l Morphy day was h e l d yesterday, against strong opposition from Apcbllo 12.
