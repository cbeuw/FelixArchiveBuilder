I C Winning Streak
IC 16 pts.; Kings 6 pts.
On Wednesday, October
29, King's College were well
beaten at Harlington. A l -
though 6—0 down to 2
King's penalties in the first
10 minutes, IC fought back
well to overwhelm their op-
ponents with superior for-
ward play. The pack played
magnificently, especially in
the loose, where " fresher "
Brille-Edwards shone. Tries
were scored by John Kelly,
Bob Atkins, George Widel-
ski and John Ballard who
also kicked two conver-
sions.
UC 6 pts.; IC 15 pts.
Old rivals UC were con-
clusively beaten on Wednes-
day 5th, in a rather niggly
brand of match at Shenley.
If IC had concentrated more
on playing good construc-
tive rugby instead of engag-
ing in points-wasting fisti-
cuffs the scoreline would
certainly have read differ-
ently. Two good individual
tries by Terry Stephenson
and a superb drop goal by
new fly-half Alan Roberts
proved the only really bright
spots of the match. A try
by Roy Anderson and a
penalty by John Ballard
made up the rest of the IC
score.
London Irish 2nd XV
11 pts.; IC 17 pts.
This match, played on
Saturday, November 8th,
proved a tremendous win
for IC against a very strong
club side—indeed the home
back division included
Mooney, the Irish interna-
tional winger! P l a y i n g
against the wind in the first
half, IC were unlucky to be
8 pts. down at the interval
after pressing strongly. How-
ever, due to a concentrated
team effort, tries by Roy
Anderson, John Gardner
and Andy Clark plus two
glorious 40 yard penalty
drop-goals by Terry Ste-
phens—who also kicked a
conversion—saw IC safely
through to what must be
their best win of the season
to date.

Swimming
IC vs. London Hospitals
In their first fixture of
the season, the Water-Polo
club played the very strong
combined London Hospitals
side. The Hospitals, with 5
UC first team players, did
not at first have much cohe-
sion, and IC were able to
penetrate the mid-bath gaps
to make several serious
attacks leading to the first
goal.
The Hospitals did not
make much headway in the
set-piece attacks, e.g. from
free throws but soon discov-
ered their ability to make
fast, telling counter attacks.
These were due to the in-
experience of the College
side, both players in cover-
ing whenever their backs
were committed to an
attack. In this way the Hos-
pitals built up a 6—3 lead
by the third quarter. In the
last quarter the college chan-
ged its tactics by leaving one
experienced back to break
up the counter-attacks and
limiting the attack to two
players. In the much less
congested space the IC for-
wards scored four quick
goals to make the score 7—
7 with 20 seconds to go.
Only a last second goal by
UH gave them victory. A l l
in all this was a very good
display by an untried col-
lege team against by far the
strongest opposition that
will be met this season.
IC vs. City University
In a fixture against City
University, IC completely
dominated the swimming
winning all the men's and
women's events. With the
top competitive freestyle
backstroke and breast stroke
swimmers in U L U the IC
swimming team should be
impossible to live with this
season. In the following polo
match an essentially IC sec-
ond team was in difficulty
against a physically quite
strong City side. The inclu-
sion of two first team play-
ers in the last quarter gave
IC 5 goals to level the score
at 8—8.

Over the past fortnight
the club has not enjoyed
much success, and this has
been due in the main to
playing Club sides who al-
though not technically
superior to I.C. have more
experience and have the
added advantage of superior
teamwork gained from sev-
eral years of playing to-
gether.
However, this temporary
lack of victories is not the
most worrying problem
concerning the club at the
moment. Our main problem
is apathy—already we have
been forced to cancel the
5th X I due to a lack of
players, and it seems that
the 4th X I is now in
jeopardy. Besides the un-
pleasant present aspect of
this there is a far more
serious underlying problem
which is not fully under-
stood by most of the mem-
bers. Anyone who joins a
club when he is not at col-
lege, does so because he
wishes to play hockey on
a regular basis, and he is
therefore not a little con-
cerned when he cannot play
because the opposition can-
not raise a team. Although
the fixtures for the next
year have already been ar-
ranged, I feel that in subse-
quent years we will lose
many of these fixtures
because we are not able to
run regular lower sevens. It
is therefore vital that we
pull ourselves together and
establish regular lower
teams, which would then
become strong both on and
off the field.
Fencing
On Wednesday evening,
the fencing club made their
way intrepidly out to E7,
for the first official fixture
of the season. A London
League match against New-
ham fencing club.
The ladies team, although
fencing below their normal
standard, slashed their way
to a 5—4 victory, in a re-
markable match which was
notable for the number of
times Rebecca found herself
sitting on the ground, vic-
tim of the incredibly slip-
pery floor.
The men did equally well,
fighting back after losing the
first 3 fights, to a final score
of 6—3.
Although IC also fielded
a beginners team, Newham
were unable to meet this
challenge, so this match had
to be abandoned.
The club now has a nuc-
leus of experienced fencers,
but is still very small, so we
would welcome any begin-
ners who would like to take
up this extremely individu-
alistic sport.
Teams:
Ladies: Rebecca Winnall
(capt.), Kay Nicholson,
Margaret Price.
Men: A. Maguire (capt.), R.
Marsden, J. Mitchell.
R.W.
U.L. Cup
In the preliminary round
we were drawn against Bed-
ford College and we duly
beat them by three goals to
one. The I.C. goalscorers
were Pratt, Mudan and
Watson.
In the first round off we
played the C.E.M. and were
very unlucky to lose 1—0,
the goal being scored in the
last minute of the match. In
fact I.C. 'scored' four times
in this match as well as mis-
sing three sitters. The whole
team played well with Sar-
gent at centre-half, and the
two full-backs, Watson and
Forkes, outstanding.

Athletics
Last Wednesday ten ath-
letes competed for the U L
Relays and Field Events
Trophus at Motspur Park.
When the morning's rain
had been swept off the track
the meeting started with
about six teams competing.
Guys were strong as
usual; too strong for us in
the Field Events Competi-
tion where the unavailabil-
ity of Rugby players and the
mysterious non-appearance
of two key performers left
us sadly depleted. Revenge
was however gained in the
Relay's Competition where
a strong party of cross-
country runners combined
with their sprinters to beat
Guys into the second place.
Team: C. Atkinson, C. Burden,
S. Fletcher, G. Hunt, R.
Jensen, N. Mandeville,
N. Morrison, D. Quayle,
M. Robinson and P.

T.T.
IC kicked off the TT sea-
son with a heavy defeat of
the 5th team by London
Hospitals powerful trio. The
4th team started their chal-
lenge with a walkover, gain-
ing an easy two points due
to the non-appearance of
their opponents. Thus the
4th team goes straight to
the top of their league, a
position which I firmly
believe will be theirs at the
end of the season.
The 3rd team fell 7—3 in
their opening match, but
should improve when Mike
Gibson and Co. remove the
cobwebs from their bats and
swing into action. The 2nd
team is captained by P.
Theerathorn, who has been
giving good service to the
club for seven years, and
under the guidance of
" cyclotron ", as he is known
to one and all, this team
should do well this season.
The 1st team had a rag-
ged start to the year, losing
6—4 to a mediocre team
from QMC, and I think a
bit of practice could be use-
ful here. However, its early
days yet, and rest assured
that IC pingers will make
their mark in the leagues in
the years to come.

EDITORIAL
As can be seen from the number of reports on this page,
most clubs are now well into their fixture lists, and it is
interesting to pick out those clubs likely to gain honours
this year. The Association Football first XI took maximum
points from the first four league games, and although they
lost 2—1 to QMC last Wednesday, they must have a good
chance of the league. With a 4—1 win over UC in the cup
preliminary round the first XI might even be thinking in
terms of the ' double ' this year.
The rugby club has also had some good results, including
a particularly impressive win against London Irish, and
despite a slight falter against LSE they have already beaten
UC once this season and should deal with them in the
Gutteridge Cup on 19th November.
At the time of writing, the Boat Club members are train-
ing hard in their constituent college teams for the Morphy
and Lowry races, held on Wednesday 19th. A change of
venue for home matches seems to have affected the ten pin
bowling club and they are not having the success they knew
last season. The basketball club has enough members to
run three teams this year, and therefore should have a
strong first team.
Finally, Felix wishes every success to the three members
of I.C. Badminton club playing in the British Universities
Sports Federation Badminton Championship, at Crystal
Palace tomorrow. J.C.D.

ICWA Hockey 2;
Royal Holloway 0.
The ladies hockey team
maintained their good form
of the season with a 2—0
victory at Harlington against
Royal Holloway. Both
goals came in the first half
and with the attack always
putting pressure on the R H
defence, the IC defence had
little trouble containing any
attack.
Team: J. Buzzard, S. Edwards,
J. ManfieJd, S. Inskip,
M. Lewis, H. Hutchin, J.
Allinson, S. Thompson,
L. Beynon (capt.), M.
Paluch, M. Diggens.
Mixed Hockey 2;
Heston 1.
Fielding a rather wea-
kened team, IC were not
surprisingly 1—0 down at
half time to a rather hard
team from Heston. Playing
with more determination
than skill, however, they
were able to equalise and
go on to win with two well-
taken goals.
Badminton:
ICWA 7; Bedford 2.
Three of the nine games
were taken by a walk-over,
leaving IC to win only 2 of
the remaining 6 games to
take the match. With the
first pair easily winning 3
and the other pairs fighting
hard, IC finished easy win-
ners.
Team: L. Beynon, R. Date, S.
Thompson, F. Mackin-
non (capt.), H. Hutchin,
M. Diggens.
Mixed Badminton:
IC 3; QMC 6.
Against a very strong
QMC team, IC were never
confident of winning, but
fought hard and with most
games going to 3 sets the
match was in fact closer
than the score suggests.
Netball:
UC 17; IC 11.
In this, the first match of
the season, IC were only
able to field a team of 6
players. However, with some
good shooting from the
goal attack, UC, with a full
team of 7, were held to a
9—7 lead at half time. In
the final two quarters, how-
ever, UC used their numer-
ical advantage to run out
winners by 17—11.
Team: I. Songin, M. Davies, J.
