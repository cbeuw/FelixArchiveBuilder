As the academic year draws to a close,
Felix takes a look back at the biggest
headlines of the past year.
What did Imperial get
up to this year?
This year, Felix has covered a
plethora of stories from all corners of
the campus, covering stories relevant
to staff and students alike. We recap
the stories we’ve brought to you this
year, and what to watch out for next
year.
BUAV hit our front pages twice
this year; firstly, the animal rights
organisation made headlines back
in October when the Home Office
investigation, triggered by their
undercover investigation into animal
testing at the college, was completed.
The investigation found at the time
that many of the BUAV allegations
were unsubstantiated, and only five
cases of non-compliance were found.
Despite this, BUAV claimed
in May that the government
had misrepresented the group
by reporting 180 instead of 18
complaints made. BUAV were
successful in their application for
a judicial review against the Home
Office, and their plight is ongoing.
Judicial reviews can take several
months, and BUAV will be hoping
it will result in tougher sanctions
against Imperial. We’ll probably hear
the result at some point next year.
We also investigated the cuts to the
amenities funds in halls this year,
something that caused contention
for hall seniors and wardens after
they tried to provide a freshers
week experience on a shoestring.
The funding, that comes from the
total rent that students pay at the
beginning of each term, was cut from
as high as £3.50 down to £1.50 per
person per week, meaning many
activities had to be cut as a result of
the slashed budget.
Although Felix was told that the
cuts were to ensure the savings
would “Go back into the pockets
of students,” and despite asking
repeatedly for figures to show this
is the case, we were unable to verify
that these cuts meant students were
paying less for rent.
Many speculated that the money
was going back into the pockets of
campus services.
We covered the antics of the rugby
teams too in Autumn term. The first
XV of ICURFC were suspended back
in October after stripping on a tube
back from West London, causing the
tube to come to a halt and commuters
asked to disembark from the tube as
a result. The team was temporarily
suspended as the British Transport
Police investigated the matter, and
a week later were joined in club
purgatory by the Medic rugby team
after a window was broken on a coach
they were using during a tour trip to
Bristol.
The ICURFC was suspended for a
total of two weeks, the same period
the Medicals were also suspended for.
Students directly involved were also
made to perform some sort of “Union
service.”
The Captain of the ICURFC was
also threatened with a vote of no-
confidence, with Imperial College
Union stating that he had lied to
them during their investigation.
However, after a petition collected
over 500 signatures in support of the
player, he lived to play another day
as Union Council voted against the
motion.
Some of the many sportsmen and
women who attended Council for
the debate expressed a feeling that
the Union was working against clubs
rather than with them.
The Medicals rugby team was not
as fortunate; with their suspension
meaning they would have to forfeit
several key games, they would lose
money from BUCS fines and also,
with a ban on socialising, they could
no longer host the popular Christmas
Bop, based at the Reynolds bar. They
appealed against the sanctions, but
the Trustee Board, the highest board
within the Union, rejected the appeal.
“Publish and Perish” was Felix’s
front page in December, as a scandal
erupted over the suicide of the late
professor Stefan Grimm.
An email was sent posthumously
under Grimm’s name alleging
that the College was being run as
a “business”, with the deceased
academic apparently being told to
obtain an increased amount of grant
funding or resign.
Science blogger David Colquhoun
condemned the College’s attitude,
arguing for a public inquiry into
Grimm’s death.
The College strongly denied that
Professor Grimm was under formal
review and launched a formal review
in the circumstances surrounding
Grimm’s death. The coroner’s report
found that Grimm’s suicide was likely
attributable to the pressure arising
from grant applications, while College
themselves said they don’t know if
changes to College policies suggested
in the internal review would have
prevented his death.
Also in February, a paper was
brought to Union Council, the effect
being College allowing Council
members to determine hall rents
for the following year. In this paper,
students learnt the intention to close
both Weeks and Pembridge halls.
College’s argument for the closure
of the halls was due to their alleged
high cost of refurbishment. Debra
Humphries, the Vice-Provost
(Education) also argued that the
College could make better use of the
space in both “academic” and “non-
academic” uses.
Whilst Council resolved to
campaign against closure of
Pembridge, they initially voted to
not campaign against the closure
of Weeks. When College later
announced their intention to close
the hall for the following year,
residents of Weeks launched a
campaign protesting against the
College’s decision.
This later, through an emergency
meeting of Council, lead to the
original decision to not oppose the
closure being overturned. A campaign
was also initiated to lobby College
to be more transparent in decision
making known as #ICAProblem,
although how this campaign has
progressed is unknown.
Nonetheless, College have
continued with their plan to close
Weeks, and it will not be available for
students starting next year. A party
will be held today to commemorate
the hall.
March’s Varsity brought
accusations of misogyny upon Sport
Imperial, when members of the
female rugby team reported abuse
from a member of staff, who was
heard over a radio saying, “I don’t
care how those fat girls get home”.
As well as this, there was
insufficient transport to for all
members of the female rugby team,
who hadn’t played at The Stoop
before. In May, an investigation
conducted by the college with
assistance from the union concluded
that the team had been “made a
mockery of”. A letter of apology

to the team from president Alice
Gast referred to the situation as
“unacceptable” the report concluded
that changes were needed in
relation to the conduct of staff and
organisation of future sports events.
Recommendations included
commissioning research into the
issue of sexism in sport, informed
by workshops involving Imperial
students and changing the format
of Varsity to give fixtures equal
prominence. There was a question
mark over the nature of Varsity itself,
with one point questioning whether
it should matches should continue as
“purely internal competitions”.
Although the report was announced
in response to complaints of staff
sexism from the female rugby team,
several points concentrated on the
culture of alcohol consumption at the
event. It was firmly stated that the
sale of spirits onsite will be prohibited
in the future with prevention of
bringing alcohol in being strictly
enforced.
“Alcohol abuse” in general was
mentioned as an issue for focus for
other departments. Are we looking
at an alcohol free future for Varsity?
It’s unlikely; our sources say spirits
weren’t available at the stoop this year
anyway, and the search process at the
door is pretty comprehensive. We’ll
likely see a change in the timetable of
Varsity matches, and organisation of
transport, but the unequal treatment
of teams due to sex, as the rugby
players claimed, may be a harder issue
to detect.
A week before the Imperial Festival
took over campus, a student was
sentenced to 18 months in prison for
the possession of 30,000 child porn
images. Nur Nordin, a third year
Mathematician, was found with a
life-size mannequin of a young boy
when police, who’d been notified
about suspicious activity coming
from his account, raided his address
"Many
speculated
that the
money was
going back
into the
pockets of
campus
services."
"Students
directly
involved
were also
made to
perform
some sort
of “Union
service.”"
"March’s
Varsity
brought
accusations
of
misogyny
upon Sport
Imperial"
"a student
was
sentenced
to 18
months
in prison
for the
possession
of 30,000
child porn
images"
in Queensborough Terrace.
Many of the images were Category
A, with the Metropolitan Police
saying they were some of the most
extreme their specialist officers had
ever seen. Pleading guilty to all 17
counts, including making indecent
images of children within intent to
distribute.
The Malay student, who was on a
scholarship paid for by the Malaysian
government, has had his studentship
at Imperial revoked, but a member
of the council that provided the
scholarship has commented that
Nordin’s funding may be restored,
and he could be allowed to attend a
university in his home country. It’s
likely that he will face deportation
upon release, and if he doesn’t serve
the full term, we may hear of his
education continuing abroad within
the next year.
This year we saw several Felix
headlines concerning the mental
wellbeing of students, and their
welfare in general. In January, we also
ran the results of a survey of final
year medical school students, which
found that 50% of respondents said
that their financial concerns affect
their mental health. The survey
results sparked debate over the cuts
to funding medical students in their
final year face once their Imperial
bursary is removed for their fifth and
sixth year of study.
In May, we also published the
findings of the student-led campaign
Mentality, which found that 3 out
of 4 students suffer from extreme
levels of stress or have had a mental
health condition. Students were
twice as likely to be stressed who
attend Imperial compared to other
universities in the UK.
Exam organisation and copy
editing exam scripts within certain
departments has also not fared well
this year. The business school saw
a blackboard crash resulting in an
online test having to be suspended
shortly before Christmas, and then
later had to investigate the make-up
test after rumours of plagiarism.
There was also case of a handful of
undergraduate students sitting exam
papers meant for MSc students in
Aeronautics.
In February, we ran a piece about
a series of assessment mistakes in
Physics Assessed Problem sheets
and in a revision test, and students
being told to take “It on the chin...
it is a drop in the ocean,” by a senior
lecturer within the department.
Following that, second year
students were set an impossible exam
question only a couple of weeks ago,
and as far as Felix is aware, nothing
will be rectified for certain until exam
scripts are assessed.
All in all, the year has been far from
dull, with plenty of stories to keep us
in business for another year. With
some of these still developing, we
will be following them through the
Summer and into the next academic
year, so make sure to pick up a copy.
