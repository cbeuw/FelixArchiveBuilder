We enter a dark room
scattered with rocking
chairs. The far wall
is covered by an array of bright
yellow lights, emanating heat and
an irritating electrical buzz, while
dimly lit bulbs hang from the
ceiling. Taking our seats on the
cushioned wood, I can see the looks
of anticipation and curiosity on faces
around me. Like them, I had little
idea of what to expect, though we
were promised to be “immersed into
an atmospheric chamber of multiple
speakers and ambient lights” whilst
listening to Samuel Beckett’s radio
play, All That Fall.
All That Fall, while obsessed with
the mundane and the menial, paints
our world as a dark and grotesque
place. The one-act play follows the
elderly Maddy Rooney, who makes
her way along a country road to meet
her husband at the train station.
Her journey is tiresome and she
feels as if all the world is working
against her. Although friendly
passers-by offer to help her she still
moans, and when she finally reaches
the station, the train is late; the cause
of this delay we don’t discover until
a harrowing climax towards the end.
This is a unique moment of suspense
and emotion in comparison to the
rest of the play, which feels rather
ordinary. Maddy complains at the
small things in life, she becomes
annoying and self-righteous, and
listening to her I began to tire of life
myself.
This is a sort of a magic I have
only recognised in hindsight: one
that allowed me to step into an
existentialist perspective on the world
and see some of its absurdities and
hollowness. Depressing though it is,
it’s an invaluable perspective, and in
fact caused frequent bouts of laughter
in the room. Laughter may indeed be
the right response to life’s absurdity.
In this production, the voice acting
was superb and evocative. I could
physically feel the weariness in
Maddy’s voice, and the action was
easily and vividly cast against the
backdrop of my eyelids. However,
more than reproducing Beckett’s
masterful script, the recording – I
think through the timing and
mixing of ambient sounds – lent
the experience a harsh objectivity. I
felt like a spirit floating through the
action, never feeling at home. There
was a sort of tunnel vision: voices
and noises seemed to appear and
disappear unexpectedly and were
heard abstractly – their existence
preceding their essence as the
existentialists would say.
I am less certain about the visual
components of this production.
Sitting, or rather, rocking in the dark
among the many others in the room
did lend an air of occasion to the
process, but I found the light show
to be distracting. The orange lamps
seemed to fade on and off without
logic, accompanying the sounds of an
engine first and then a gust of wind.
At one moment they were arranged in
the shape of a cross, which I thought
to be a heavy-handed statement to
impose on such a subtle text. This is a
play that could be better experienced
at home, in a dark room, with a good
set of speakers, but if you do decide
to go – make sure you keep your eyes
closed.
The Peter Pan Theatre’s production of
All That Fall is on at the Barbican until
21st
June. Tickets from £18, plus booking
fee, available online.

Editorial: A
Farewell

SECTION EDITORS
Swan songs.Exits to stage right.
Magnum opera.The arts world
is full of goodbyes and farewells.
Players make their entrances
and their exits; old pros leave the
stage,making space for those
novices waiting in the wings; and
Felix Artsis no different.This year,
we have both had a wonderful
time as Arts Editors; throughout
our tenure we have tried to place
arts content at the centre of the
paper,and thus–hopefully–at
the centre of student life.
Coming to Imperial,one thing
that concerned both of us
was not the infamous gender
ratio,nor the extortionate cost
of living in West London,but
instead the lack of arts students,
which we feared would lead
to a university experience that
was devoid of life and energy,
focussing instead on lab reports,
experiments,and days poring
over textbooks.In some ways,
Imperial surprised us; the lack of
arts students meant that anyone
could give culture a go–the
drama societies weren’t just run
by a group of english language
students; the fine arts society
wasn’t just the habitat of the
art historians; instead,there
was a melting pot of disciplines,
collaborating to try and continue
their passion for the arts.
At the same time,there were
disappointments.A general
malaise among the student
body–prompted,partly,by the
disregard with which Imperial
treats its undergraduates–
meant that those who were
confident about exploring
their passion were few and
far between.We have sought
to rectify that.High points of
this year have included the
publication of the Culture pull-
out in the 1600th
issue,and the
resurrection of Phoenix,the arts
quarterly,which will be coming
out as a separate magazine
next week.But the real legacy
we want to leave behind is
the beginnings of an artistic
community.We will both be
stepping down next year,making
way for the next group of editors,
who we are sure will continue
to build on the foundations we
have set down.And for those of
you who–like us–were worried
about finding other students
who are interested in opera,in
dance,in painting,all you need
to do is open Felix,and check out
the bylines in the Arts Section.
Thanks for a fantastic year.
