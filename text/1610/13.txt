Jack Steadman looks back at the latest season of Game of Thrones
Still surviving... still thriving?
Another year, another season
of Game of Thrones draws to
a close.
This year marks a key milestone
in the adaptation however, as with
the end of season closer “Mother’s
Mercy” the show has officially caught
up with the books.
Despite adamant assurances from
showrunners David Benioff and D.
B. Weiss that it wouldn’t be a case of
‘one season, one book’, it all seems to
have turned out that way.
Some clever merging of characters
combined with streamlined storylines
means that, even with judicious
blurring of the lines between books,
season five’s ending matches up near
perfectly with book five, A Dance with
Dragons.
It’s hard for it not to feel like a
conscious decision on the part of
the showrunners – doing it this way
buys George R. R. Martin enough
time to finish and publish book six,
The Winds of Winter before the show
returns next spring.
Compared to the books, the series
has managed to avoid feeling like
it’s treading water too heavily at any
point, although not without some
difficulties.
Events in ‘Mother’s Mercy’
managed the interesting feat of using
moments from earlier in the book to
finish off storylines, chopping and
changing as Benioff and Weiss felt
necessary, not least in Arya’s plotline.
Out of everyone, Arya is perhaps
the biggest victim of Martin’s
tendency to tread water in the later
novels, leading to her final scenes
managing the entertaining feat of
covering events that have already
happened in the books at the same
time as handling those that are still
yet to come.
It sounds silly on paper – using
something that should have happened
several episodes ago to round up a
storyline that’s now overtaken the
books – but it’s typical of Benioff and
Weiss’ intelligent, careful approach to
how they handle the delicate situation
they find themselves in.
Until now, their audience has sat
in two camps – those who have read
the books, and those who haven’t,
resulting in two very different
viewing experiences.
For those already in the know for
events coming up, the joy was in the
adaptation itself, in finally seeing the
books come to life (and, increasingly,
seeing how the showrunners chose to
alter the original plot lines, often for
the better).
There was also a perverse glee in
watching the damage wrought by
the show’s twists and turns on the
unsuspecting fresh TV audience, with
the likes of the Red Wedding, the
Purple Wedding (lots of capitalised
weddings in this show) and the
demise of the Red Viper all provoking
a highly entertaining response from
the non-book reading viewers.
The show has been impossibly
successful at straddling that tightrope
between audiences, with this series
marking the point where the team
behind it all had to make some tough
decisions about how much of the
future (which is already known to the
pair) to reveal before Martin has the
chance.
The answer, as it turns out, was
far more than most people were
expecting, with the eighth episode
‘Hardhome’ marking a watershed for
the show on that front.
Easily one of the best episodes
of the entire run, “Hardhome”
took some liberties with the books,
turning a previously off-screen battle
featuring no major characters into
a full-blown on-screen one, but also
showed the true stakes at play in this
series.
It’s been all about politics up to
now. Mostly, anyway.
All about the titular game of
thrones where, as Aiden Gillen’s
Littlefinger so memorably puts it:
“You win or you die.”
Choosing the title of the first
book in the series, rather than its
actual name, as the title for the TV
adaptation now feels very, very
deliberate.
Calling it A Song of Ice and Fire
might occasionally remind viewers
of the larger game taking place in
Westeros.
Full credit to Benioff and Weiss for
burying that one.
As ‘Hardhome’ reminded everyone,
there is a much, much bigger threat to
everyone in Westeros than the antics
of the ruling families, arriving in the
shape of the White Walkers and their
army of the undead.
We saw them in the very first scene
of the entire series (also true of the
books), and they’ve dipped in and
out since then, but it’s been very easy
to forget the massing threat on the
north side of the Wall.
No longer. If season five is
remembered for nothing else, let it be
that: this was the season that blew the
whole thing wide open. The stakes are
raised. The war is truly underway.
It’s not the only thing that season
five will be remembered for, though,
for better and for worse. Mainly for
worse.
The show got itself into hot water
with yet another use of sexual
violence as a plot-driving device,
again against one of the major female
characters.
Whereas the infamous scene in
season four felt like a mistake – a
scene that was intended one way, but
filmed (and written) in such a way
that it felt inescapably wrong – here
was something that, to an audience at
large, felt completely unjustifiable.
It’s undeniably troubling, that’s
for sure, but the treatment in later
episodes went some way to improving
the situation (confirmation, if any
were needed, that shows must be
taken as a whole, at least as seasons,
rather than just judged on individual
episodes), as the writers just about
managed to veer away from using
the rape as part of a male character’s
arc, instead tying it to the agency of
the female in question and using it to
drive her arc forwards.
Mishandled? A little. As wholly
unjustified as the internet outcry
would have you believe? Probably not.
Game of Thrones has always courted
controversy, sometimes for legitimate
reasons, other times simply because
it accidentally sailed a little too close
to the wind, and this season was no
exception.
But the show has always been (and
hopefully will always be) more than
that, better than that.
Going by the strength of the
closing few episodes of this season, it
promises to maintain the impossibly
high bar of standards it has set for
itself, and promises to keep leading
the charge for quality television
programming everywhere.
If you want my main concern, it’s
looking almost certain that the show
will get to the end before the books
do.
I don’t know how I’ll cope with not
knowing what’s coming next.
