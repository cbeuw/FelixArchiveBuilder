Yung Nam Cheah lists why spending your holiday in London is awesome
London’s calling – Making the most of spending your Summer in the Capital
Not all of us have the time to jet
off to a different location and
spend the summer holidays
hopping from one destination to
another, but that doesn’t mean
that you can’t have fun in good old
London either. In fact, London is one
of the most visited cities of all times
and there’s probably a thousand
people out there who would swap
places with you in a heartbeat.
But what is there to do? Some of
you might whine: I have already
spent the last year(s) in this place and
explored everything I could. If you
are actually asking this, then you
really don’t understand the magic
of summer. Summer is a time for
rooftop cinemas, parks, markets
and pop ups – and in order to truly
convince you, I have compiled a list
of the best of the best to look out for:
Rooftop cinema
A surprisingingly large number of
pop up cinemas surface during the
summer months, and among them
rooftop cinemas are the most magical
kind. With a big silver screen, a
scatter of deck chairs or bean bags,
London evening sky viewed at several
storey high slowly darkening. It’s a
movie experience like no others.
You can catch a rooftop movie at
Shoreditch with the Golden Bee
Cinema, or across various venues
with Press Play or Roof Top Film
Club. Movies range from cult
phenomenon like Fight Club to
recent hits like The Grand Budapest
Hotel and tickets usually ballpark
around £15.
Alternatively, you can watch movies
with non-rooftop pop up cinemas
such as The Big Cinema Club for as
little as £5 with drinks and popcorn.
The Parks of London
While London is known as a
metropolis, its Royal Parks actually
cover a whopping 1978 hectares
of ground. Made up of 8 parks, the
reason why they are called Royal
is because they used to be hunting
grounds of the royal family but are
now open to the public. It is worth
noting that Kensington Gardens,
Hyde Park, Green Park and St James
Part form an almost unbroken
stretch of green space together and
Regents Park is only a few blocks
north of the northeast tip of Hyde
Park. Most of you have probably
been to a few on the list, so why not
complete the set during Summer?
Green Park
With only 16 hectare of ground,
Green Park is the smallest of the
Royal Parks. It lies between Hyde
Park and St James Park and does not
offer much in terms of attractions.
It sits beside the busy transport
station of the same name and border
Buckingham Palace on its south with
the A4 running across it on one side.
St James Park
Stretching all the way along with the
Mall, this beautiful park covers 23
hectares with a small lake called St
James’s Park Lake. The blue bridge
spanning across the lake offers an
excellent view of the Buckingham
Palace and Westminster. This
is by far the most central park
with Horse Guards parade and 10
Downing Street at the other end, and
Trafalgar’s Square just a stone throw
away.
Hyde Park
The largest park in Central London,
though only fourth largest in the
Royal Parks, it covers 142 hectares
west of Green Park. It is divided in
two by its lake, the Serpetine and
the Long Water and the former is
an excellent boating place in the
summer. It is famous for its Speaker’s
Corner on the northeast corner
where any lawful public speaking can
be conducted, as well as the Diana,
Princess of Wales memorial and the
Holocaust memorial, both near the
Serpentine.
Kensington Gardens
Often confused as part of Hyde
Park, the Kensington Garden is on
the otherside of the West Carriage
Drive and is locked at night. It
covers 111 hectares, and is home to
the Serpentine Gallery, the Albert
Memorial, the Round Pond, Italian
Gardens, Kensington Palace and the
Diana Memorial Playground.
Regents Park
North of Baker street and spanning
over 166 hectares, the beautiful
Regents Park containing Regent’s
University London and the London
Zoo. This open parkland has a wide
range of garden, a personal favourite
being their rose garden, a picturesque
lake, many sports ground and even an
open air theatre.
It is also dotted with villas with an
inner and outer ring road that take
you around all the main attractions.
Bushy Park
With 445 hectares, Bushy Park is the
second largest of Royal Parks and
immediately north of the Hampton
Court Palace. It is a Site of Special
Scientific Interest, with abundant
wildlife and fishing ponds.
Richmond Park
The largest of all royal parks,
Richmond Park boast 955 hectares
and was created by Charles I in the
17th
Century as a deer park.
It is a national nature reserve and
includes many building of historic
interest such as the White Lodge (a
former royal residence). The best way
to get around the park is by cycling.
Greenwich Park
A former hunting ground turns green
space, Greenwich park is part of
Greenwich’s World Heritage side and
London is one of the top destination in the world. With culture, history, beautiful parks and famous nightlife, there’s plenty to do in the capital.

cover 74 hectares.
It offers a spectacular view towards
Canary Wharf from its hills, its main
attraction is the Royal Observatory
where you can walk across the
Greenwich Meridian.
Markets, Markets and
more markets
London has no shortage of markets,
and if I were to list them all we would
probably end up being here all day. So
I will only present a small selection of
my absolutely favourite here:
Portobello Market
Made famous by the movie Notting
Hill, Portobello on a Saturday is the
place to be. Mostly focus on antiques
and vintages, it’s worth bearing in
mind that while the South end is
more picturesque, the less tourist
catered part is towards the Ladbroke
Groove Underground Station. There
are also no shortage of food vendors
and quirky restaurants in the area for
those who don’t want to stand and
eat.
Best time to go: Saturday 9:00 – 19:00
Nearest stations: Ladbrooke Grove, and
Notting Hill Underground
Brick Lane
Lined with Indian restaurants and
fabric shops, the true Brick Lane
Sunday Upmarket does not start until
near the Truman Brewery.
Featuring a scattering of smaller
markets, you have not one, not two,
but three food areas bursting with
international cuisines waiting for you
to sample.
After you have satisfied your
hunger, there is a maze of vintage
shops and antique vendors around
the area for you to browse, not to
mention the street stores lining the
main road.
The area is also home to famous
vintage shops such as Beyond Retro
whilst Spitalfield markets is only a
stone throw away.
Best time to go: Sunday 9:00 – 17:00
Nearest station: Best to walk there from
Liverpool Street (10 minutes)
Columbia Road Flower Market
A ten minutes’ walk from Brick Lane,
Columbia Road Flower Market now
attracts an international crowd. From
peonies to carnations, you can find
all sorts of flowers and potted plants
selling in this market.
Despite the positively cloistering
crowd, it might be worth going at the
end of the day so you can grab some
cheap flowers to brighten up your
summer.
Opening times: 8:00 – 3:00 (ish)
Address: Columbia Road, London, E2
7RG
Camden Lock Market
Having expanded in recent years,
this historical market originated as a
stable market.
Open every day of the week –
there are a plethora of food vendors
and charming artist selling their
cuisine and crafts. In addition to
that are some fine book stores on
the underground level and of course,
vintage shops.
Not to be missed is the futuristic
Cyberdog store, photographic
opportunity with the horse statues
and the beautiful raised terrace of

Opening times: 10:00 – 18:00
Nearest station: Camden Town
Pop ups
The pop up scene has become
increasingly popular in London,
mostly in regard to food. While
not exactly the cheapest around
the world, there’s no question that
London pop up scene has one of the
wildest imaginations. I would try to
cover some, but I know I won’t even
get close.
Immersive Theaters London
The kind of pop up that send your
heart into a wild frenzy, immersive
theatres are the new way to
experience the world of theatrics.
Allowing you to take part in the
drama itself, you get to be chased
by the bad guy and make deals with
the heroines, or if you fancy, get
chased by zombies. London is home
to several so I would pull up a list,
bear in mind that these are not the
cheapest indulgent.

The Nantucket Beach Club
Rooftop Pop-up Bars
Nantucket is a little known island
in Massachusetts and this summer
Hilton Hotel Tower Hill is bringing
the charm of the East Coast to the
London rooftop. Serving cocktails
and cuisine inspired by Nantucket,
there’s nowhere else better suited for
you to unwind in the evening with
a Surfside Punch on the side (unless
you go to the island yourself).
Open: 1/5 – 30/9 from Tuesday to
Saturday 15:00 – 22:00.
Address: Skylounge at Double Tree by
