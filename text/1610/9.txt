Brendan Brown talks to Joshua Renken about Max Planck,
the father of quantum mechanics
Brandon Brown has spent
his career teaching Physics.
Starting off as physics graduate
from Rice University, Brandon
got his PhD from Oregon State
University and later attained a
certificate in Science Communication
at the University of Califronia,
Santa Cruz. Now a professor at
the University of San Francisco,
Brandon’s research focus has shifted
to sensory biophysics and high-
temperature superconductivity.
Research students at his laboratory
have explored the electric and
magnetic sensory abilities of a variety
of creatures.
He has written a book about the life
and work of Max Planck (1858-1947),
the German theoretical physicist
and 1918 Nobel Prize Laureate who
is considered the father of quantum
theory, to be published by Oxford
University Press in 2015. Brandon
has spent most of his career working
in the field of high-temperature
superconductivity – an exciting
theoretical area of physics that
heavily relies on the quantum
principles that Planck was first to
propose.
I got in touch with Brandon to ask
him about his new book and the state
of science communication around the
world.
Joshua Renken: What is it about
Planck’s life and work that drew
you to write “Max Planck: Driven
by Vision, Broken by War?”
Brandon Brown: I first fell for
Planck when I was an undergraduate
student at Rice University in
Houston. His little photo in our
textbook looked unusually sad, and
I was fascinated to find someone
making a breakthrough in middle age
versus the canonical age of about 23.
JR: Can you briefly describe what
Max Planck is remembered for in
the field of Physics?
BB: He’s primarily known as the
father of quantum theory, at the
textbook level, for a breakthrough
he had in 1900. But I think it
would be fair to say he should be
just as well known for his work in
thermodynamics and for introducing
us to so-called natural units. As for
quantum theory itself, as the book
sets out, it is not quite right to point
to a “discovery” moment. It’s always
a more rich and complex story than
that.
JR: How important do you think
it is for scientists to learn about
the history and people behind big
breakthroughs?
BB: I think it’s very important, but
as a professor, I know too well how
difficult it is to fit such stories into a
curriculum, as we hardly have time to
give students access to all the nuts and
bolts as it stands. More than anything,
stories about the process should be
instructive to students of science.
We actually don’t move forward one
magical breakthrough moment at a
time. It’s a very messy business that
textbooks sanitize in order to make a
subject more digestible.
JR: Why do you think it is
that of all the great physicists in
history, Einstein has achieved the
most legendary status in the minds
of people today? And how would
you say Einstein and Planck differ
in outlook and scientific approach?
BB: That’s a huge couple of
questions! To me, Einstein absolutely
deserves his iconic reputation. One
can make very valid arguments that
his work merited 4-6 individual
Nobel Prizes, (instead of just one),
and he really seemed to function at
a different level than his peers, in
multiple areas of physics. That said,
his reputation and legacy arguably
benefitted from two things: (1) his
theory of general relativity was
verified in a dramatic fashion in
1919 at the dawn of global media,
to a world starved for positive and
transcendent news, and (2) he had
ample time in the English-speaking
world, especially versus someone like
Planck.
In terms of how Planck and
Einstein differed, I would instead
want to emphasize what they had
in common. They had incredibly
different personalities but nearly
identical scientific motivations and
philosophies, in terms of holding
sacred the existence of universal
truths. That was probably the root of
their friendship, in fact.
JR: Do you think the scientific
community as a whole does enough
to educate the public about their
work?
BB: I would say yes. The
information is out there and has been
out there. Even my humble book
isn’t turning over many new stones --
maybe just a pebble or two, or turning
a German pebble to an English one.
The general public only has so much
interest in the intricacies of physics. I
thought Planck’s story might give us
a chance to sneak a little more physics
to non-scientists, since Planck’s
incredible and tragic story transcends
science in so many ways. How many
stories have both Hitler and Einstein
as major secondary characters?
JR: What areas of physics do
you think we will see major
advancements in over the next
decade?
BB: Since I’m more of a wrenches
and wires type of physicist, versus a
theoretical shaman of physics, I’m
the wrong person to ask. With all the
new astrophysical data flooding our
computers and with the LHC going
again, we can ideally get back into
some very fundamental questions.
JR: What are you currently
working on at the University of
San Francisco?
BB: I was immersed for many

characters?"
years in a new science building, of
all things. I’ve emerged from that
into this book project, and I hope to
pursue another book or two.

New Horizons set to uncover Pluto
On 14th
July, New Horizons will fly by Pluto, before heading off to explore the Kuiper belt. Image: NASA

Natural Killer cells and the fight against cancer
The year is 1980. Voyager 1 is
approaching Saturn, having
completed a three-year journey
that has spanned over a billion
kilometres. Back on Earth, NASA
are considering flying past Saturn’s
largest moon, Titan, which has
shown hints of harbouring a thick
hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere.
However this detour comes at a
price: Voyager 1 will be thrown up out
of the ecliptic (the plane that the Solar
System lies in) and will never reach
its intended final target of Pluto.
NASA decides that Titan presents a
more scientifically valuable target
than Pluto, and after leaving Titan,
Voyager begins its long and lonely
journey toward the edge of the solar
system.
Thirty-five years later, the
questions that were left unanswered
about Pluto following Voyager’s
diversion may finally be getting
answered. New Horizons, one of
NASA’s flagship missions, is less than
a month away from the Pluto system.
Launched from Cape Canaveral
in Florida in January 2006, New
Horizons used a gravitational
slingshot around Jupiter to accelerate
it to an Earth-relative velocity of over
58,000 km/h. At that speed, it could
cover the distance from London to
New York in just under six minutes,
and could reach the Moon in less than
a day.
At the time of writing, New
Horizons is just over 32 million
kilometres from Pluto, and is closing
at a speed of 13km/s. At this speed, its
encounter will be brief – beginning
in the second week of July, there will
be a few short days in which to gather
data about the planet, its three major
moons and the space environment
between them.
Following this, New Horizons
will begin the long journey into
interstellar space. The hope is that
there will be enough hydrazine fuel
remaining after the flyby to direct
New Horizons on to visit a small, icy
body known as a Kuiper Belt Object
(KBO). These are icy fragments,
many of which are around 100km
in size, that inhabit the region of
the System out beyond the orbit of
Neptune. The hope is that analysis
of a KBO, an object that is effectively
a left-over of the Solar System’s
formation, will help us understand
the dynamics of the process through
which planets formed. If a suitable
KBO can be found, a flyby will
have to occur within the next four
Natural Killer (NK) cells are
a type of white blood cells
critical to the immune
system. They are primarily involved
in innate immunity the immune’s
system “first line of defense”. They
are now the subject of much research
because they show an extremely
fast response, starting to act on
infected cells within hours following
an infection. NK cells can target
“stressed” cells (such as cells infected
with virus or cancer cells.
As their name implies, they not
only target cancer cells but also kill
them, by releasing toxins into the
cells and causing cell death. For these
reasons, NK cells may prove to be
useful in treating cancer. In recent
years, there is a new trend in cancer
therapy called immunotherapy.
Immunotherapy is the treatment of
disease by enhancing or suppressing
the immune system. It has potentially
less serious side effects than most
conventional chemotherapy, which
can cause changes in the normal
development of children with
leukaemia and reduce the fertility of
adult patients.
As the President of the European
Society for Medical Oncology
(ESMO), Professor Rolf A. Stahel
said in the SMO Symposium on
Immuno-Oncology 2014, “We
expect that the new possibilities of
immunotherapy will substantially
change the treatment of cancer. We
are seeing responses and success
stories in various areas of oncology,
to the point that now I think there is
no doubt in the oncology community
that immunotherapy is here to stay.”
However, there is still much
progress to be made until
immunotherapy can actually
be used as a standalone cancer
therapy. Although there are many
possible immune-based approaches
(dendritic cell based immunity,
T-cell based immunity), NK cell-
based immunotherapy has been
said to be one of the most promising
immunotherapies due to the
intensity with which NK cells attack
target cells.
Using NK cells for immunotherapy
presents some challenges. There
are two ways in which NK cells can
be obtained: donor cells (cells from
someone else) or autologous cells
(the patient’s own NK cells). Donor
cells however have the possibility of
being rejected, as happens in organ
transplants. Autologous NK cell
numbers need to be greatly expanded
before re-infusion but that process
reduces both their survival and their
killing activity. So the main problems
to overcome are how to make NK cells
survive longer after transfusion back
into patients and how to target them
more effectively to cancerous cells.
Some researchers at Imperial focus
on manipulating the E4bp4 protein
which is critical in the production
of NK cells from blood stem cells.
“We are hoping to make it easier to
produce large numbers of human NK
cells from umbilical cord blood stem
cells and that these NK cells will have
improved survival and also be very
toxic to cancer cells when transfused
into patients”, said Dr Hugh Brady,
Department of Life Sciences. Dr
Brady’s group discovered that the
presence of E4bp4 is the switch that
makes blood stem cells turn into

to five years, after which point the
plutonium power source that powers
the spacecraft will have weakened to
the extent that instruments no longer
work at peak capacity.
The end of the mission is scheduled
for 2026, though if the spacecraft
remains in good working order it may
be extended. Some twenty years in
the future, New Horizons will likely
join Pioneers 10 and 11 and Voyagers
1 and 2 in being the only man-made
objects ever to leave our Solar System.
Because there is nothing in space
to slow it down, it will continue out
into the galaxy long after all the
instruments have fallen silent.
There are hopes that before the
antenna shuts down, NASA will beam
a ‘Record of Earth’, similar to the
golden disks carried on the Voyagers,
to the spacecraft to be stored in its
computers. The idea is that should
anyone out there ever happen across
New Horizons, they will be able to
tell where it came from and what it
was doing. Perhaps in a few hundred
thousand years it will end up sitting
in some alien’s version of the Science
Museum.
NK cells and that by increasing the
levels of E4bp4 many more NK cells
are produced. Even increasing the
numbers of NK cells in a patient may
have therapeutic effects. A 11-year
long study from Japan, published
in the Lancet showed that people
with lower numbers of NK cells
have higher incidence of cancer,

which suggests that having more NK
cells may have a prophylactic effect
against cancer.
Hopefully, the researchers at
Imperial and elsewhere in the world
will solve these problems soon so
that NK immunotherapy can realise
its promise in the clinic as a potent
weapon against cancer.
