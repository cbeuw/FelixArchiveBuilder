Joshua Renken talks religion, writing, The School of
Life, and pornography
In conversation with the author,
documentary maker and
popular philosopher, Alain de
Botton
There are not many people who
can say they have set up an
international school, written
books that have been bestsellers in
30 countries, and given two TED
talks. Fewer still can say they have
re-hung an art museum and worked
as Heathrow airport’s first ever
writer-in-residence – but the author,
documentary maker, and popular
philosopher Alain de Botton can
claim all of these achievements.
Alain has spent his working
life writing, talking and making
documentaries about the “philosophy
of the everyday.” The topics covered
in his twelve published books include:
art, success, travel, architecture,
work, the news, pessimism, atheism,
sex, love, philosophy, literature, and
many others besides. In fact, it might
be quicker simply to list the topics
Alain has not written about.
The Swiss-born public intellectual
moved to England to board at Harrow
School before going up to Cambridge
University, where he received a
double starred first in History. Alain
continued his academic career at
King’s College London with a Masters
in Philosophy and started working
on a PhD in French Philosophy at
Harvard University, before dropping
out to write for the general public.
Aged just 23, Alain’s book Essays In
Love was published to critical acclaim,
and has sold over two million copies
worldwide.
In 2008, Alain co-founded The
School of Life – an organisation that
is dedicated to “developing emotional
intelligence through the help of
culture.” Alain authors and narrates
many of the films on The School of
Life’s YouTube channel, covering
topics ranging from “the philosophy
of oral sex” and “the meaning of
life” to profiles on many of the
great philosophers and writers from
history.
I got in touch with Alain to talk
about the ideas running through his
work.
Joshua Renken: How did the School
of Life come to fruition, and what are
the problems it is trying to address?
Alain de Botton: The School of
Life was started by me and some
colleagues in 2008. The mission is to
try to raise emotional intelligence,
looking at key issues in emotional life
through the prism of the humanities
(philosophy, psychology, literature,
history and so on). We believe in
the attempt to transmit wisdom
around some of what people find
trickiest in life; knowing how to form
relationships, living with others,
facing death, finding a job that is
satisfying and right for one’s talents
etc.
JR: What key lessons can atheists
learn from organised religion?
AB: Religion was never simply about
superstition and belief. It’s also been
about an attempt to instil an ethical
code, to bring comfort, to nourish a
feeling of community, and to ritualise
key moments of existence. Religion
hasn’t always done well in these
areas (I am an atheist myself), but I
believe that atheists can learn about
the emotional needs that once drove
people to religion and should look for
ways to satiate those needs outside a
structure of ‘belief’.
JR: Do you envision a large humanist
movement in the future that employs
the tools of communication used
by religions, while the organised
religions of today fizzle out? Is this
Atheism 2.0?
AB: Yes, eventually religion will
simply become implausible, but the
needs that led humans to make up
religion will go on. So the challenge
for a secular society like ours is to
come with replacements for many of
the activities and attitudes once put
forward by religions.
JR: What do you think is more likely:
a God or many Gods?
AB: Both seem utterly implausible to
me, sadly.
JR: What was your ambition when
you and The School of Life had
the opportunity to re-hang the
Rijksmuseum of Art in Amsterdam?
Was it a success?
AB: The idea was to promote a very
instrumental way of looking at art. It
has been deeply fashionable for 150
years to claim that art has no purpose
outside of itself, that it is just ‘art for
art’s sake.’
This began as a respectable attempt
to free art from the agendas of the
state and religions; but it has ended us
up with narcissism of the worst kind.
The best art has always been
interested in helping its viewers with
the great issues of life: how to greet
death, find contentment, appreciate
existence, celebrate what is good,
condemn was seems wicked. The
Amsterdam show put this aspect of
art center stage.
It outraged many art critics (as
it was meant to; they outrage me
with their attitudes!) but it was an
enormous popular success, drawing in
hundreds of thousands of visitors to
the museum and our website.
JR: What, in your view, is the purpose
of art?
AB: The task of art is to console, to
rebalance, to awaken, to sensitise, to
question and to redeem. Art is deeply
functional, just like a stapler or a
spade.
JR: How can a pessimistic outlook
lead to a happier life? Is the secret to
happiness simply low expectations?
AB: Commercial society is unbearably
jolly – and technology leads us to
imagine that a better future is always
around the corner. Because most
of us will live to see most our hopes
dashed, it definitely pays to have a
deep reserve of pessimism to hand.
Not least, it is a great for developing
a sense of humour. The gap between
what we want the world to be and
what it is should be filled with
laughter.

JR: What do you mean when you say
the “architecture of news has broken
down” in the media?
AB: One of the worst things about the
UK is its media, which is alternately
complacent, provincial, and plain
uselessly nasty.
The task of the media is to help a
nation to understand itself better,
to gain a clearer insight into its
problems, and to move forwards with
understanding and wisdom. All this is
missing, whether from The Guardian
or The Sun or the BBC.
This shouldn’t surprise us,
we’re still at the dawn of the age
of news and are still working out
how to structure and arrange the
information we need.
JR: During research for your book The
Pleasures and Sorrows of Work, what
criteria did you find needed to be met
for a fulfilling job?
AB: Fulfilment in work essentially
"We believe
in the
attempt to
transmit
wisdom
around
some
of what
people find
trickiest in
life."
“Religion
will simply
become
implausible,
but the
needs that
led humans
to make up
religion will
go on.”
"I realised
that
academic
life was
always
going to
restrict me."
“As a
writer...the
best advice
is to think
not of what
people
might be
saying
right now,
but of how
things
[may] look
a few years
from now.”
comes from service, from helping
others in accordance with one’s best
capacities – and being moderately
well recognised for having done so.
This sounds simple but is
immensely hard, only a few of us
are properly happy in our work,
perhaps less than 10% of the working
population.
JR: How would you change the way
degree courses in the humanities are
taught? Particularly in history and
philosophy.
AB: I would dissolve away these
archaic subject categories and teach
under new categories like: Death,
Friendship, Love, Community,
Forgiveness etc.
Under such headings you’d find out
a lot about history and philosophy,
but not under those absurd academic
headings like ‘The 19th
century novel’
or ‘Neoclassicism’, titles dreamt up
by, and only of interest to, scholars.
JR: In your book How To Think More
About Sex, you touch on the subject of
pornography. Do you think society’s
general disapproval of pornography
is healthy, and are you in favour of
legalising prostitution?
AB: The point isn’t to ban
pornography or approve of all of it,
but rather to see whether we might
get a better kind of porn, which really
means a porn that’s more connected
to values esteemed in other areas of
life: dignity, respect, intelligence.
JR: Are you concerned that future
generations will no longer have the
attention span required to study great
works of philosophy and literature?
AB: Many great works are very
boring and anything writers can do to
make their work slightly pacier and
more direct should be welcomed. Let’s
stop always blaming the reader. Some
of the great masterpieces desperately
need an edit.
JR: Should I feel a bit guilty that I
find philosophy hard to read and
occasionally even a little dull?
AB: No, it’s the fault of philosophers.
Hegel is a great philosopher but he is
a properly disastrous writer.
JR: Which books have made the
biggest impact on your life?
AB: Proust’s In Search of Lost Time,
which taught me that a novel can be
philosophical.
JR: Why did you decide to stop
pursuing your PhD at Harvard?
AB: I realised that academic life was
always going to restrict me: I realised
that my real vocation was to speak
to other non-experts like me, not a
narrow coterie of specialists.
JR: Do you ever read the reviews that
come out of your books, and if so, do
you find it easy to ignore ‘the haters’
when presenting a new theory to the
public?
AB: I read all my reviews and have
learnt a lot about life and myself in
the process.
As a writer, to keep calm, the best
advice is to think not of what people
might be saying right now, but of how
things might settle down and look a
few years from now.
JR: How would you describe your
own political views?
AB: I believe in high quality
public environments, great media,
intelligent school curriculums, a
small state, very generous welfare
– and extremely careful urban
planning.

Manual went on sale earlier last year.
