INSIDE: TWEETS
Tom was elected President on
the back of his exhibitionist
photos, splashed everywhere
over the course of the campaign.
Hangman is unable to reproduce
the pictures here for legal reasons,
and is also banned from discussing
the existence of said legal reasons due
to an injunction taken out against us
by an unnamed Union President.
Most famous for his attempts to
endear himself to the notoriously
geeky population of Imperial by
inserting his own face into a popular
mobile game, Tom won his election
by some votes.
We’re not really sure how many,
and we don’t care either.
In the later days of his reign, Tom
found himself being edged out by a
new pretender to his crown, a bovine
statue.
After a shaky start to their
relationship, Tom and cow began
to form a strong bond, resulting in
Tom insisting that the cow be left to
handle all Presidential duties, as it
was “clearly so much more qualified”
than him.
As the cow (which cannot be
named, also for legal reasons) began
to become yet more proficient at the
President’s job, Tom was content to
sit in his office, stroking his finely-
groomed beard.
Alas, this ultimately proved to be
Tom’s downfall, as one unfortunate
day the cow was ‘accidentally’ tipped
over, landing on top of Tom.
Trapped under the cow, and unable
to call for help through the luscious
locks surrounding his mouth, Tom
slowly wasted away in his office.
He was eventually discovered by the
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies),
who “only went in to talk to the cow
anyway.”
Tom will be sorely missed by the
members of bearded community,
as well as the cow, who declined to
comment when Hangman spoke to
them.

We asked Abi how she felt
her year in office had been,
and she told us to “get
the hell out of my office, you stupid
wankers.”
Such was Abi’s engagement with
student media.
Her other contributions to student
life in her role in Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies) included throwing
shoes at Hangman when we made a
sarky comment about the ‘CS’ in her
title standing for ‘Crisps & Snacks’,
and desperately hiding from students
by turning the lights in her office off
and locking the door.
Needless to say, this made her
incredible popular with the student
body, as her absence meant that
another layer of needless bureaucracy
was removed from the Union, and
students were free to go and pester
staff directly instead of being told to
“talk to the DPCS.”
When Hangman caught up with
Abi in the bar one night and offered
to buy her a pint, she opened up to us
in an exclusive interview that we are
only now able to print.
“I just really wanted to do
something cool,” she told us.
Hangman asked whether she
thought that putting a cow in
Tom Wheeler’s office counted as
“something cool”, prompting her to
start cackling uncontrollably.
To the surprise and concern of all
around, her ceaseless cackling soon
lead to her inability to breath, causing
her to pass out (and eventually pass
away) in front of Hangman’s very
eyes.
Hangman feels that she died doing
what she loved: remembering that
one time she put a cow in Wheeler’s
office.
The cow’s still there, by the way.
We know it killed Wheeler, but it was
doing such a great job that nobody
really wanted to see it let go. Cows
have employment rights too, you
know.
Alex was famous for doing
something.
Honestly? We’re not
entirely sure what it was.
We do know that he always found
the time to look after his beloved
dog, prioritising Flopsy (or whatever
it was called, probably something
unbearably middle-class) over all else.
He was famous for being one of
the only people willing to attend
the Imperial-run festival (note: not
Imperial Festival, which is very, very
different and should 100% be taken
seriously by everyone, we promise
- Ed.), which took place in some
far-flung field and wasn’t as good as
Glastonbury.
He was also well known as a big fan
of horse riding, often indulging in a
spot of polo.
All around felt this displayed the
depth of Alex’s capacity for what is
often called the ‘common touch’,
an innate ability to connect with
the common or garden student, or
the rarer variant of that species, the
“Union hack.”
As with all great, tragic love stories,
Alex was killed by that which he loved
most: his dog.
While Alex slept, Flopsy mistook
him for a tasty morsel, and
subsequently devoured him whole.
Thanks in no small part to
Hangman, Chris Kaye managed
the unlikely feat of being
elevated to a cult hero.
His work for the female population
at Imperial was legendary, with
his ground-breaking policy of not
completely screwing over anyone
wishing to buy sanitary products
from the Union Shop being his most
recognisable achievement.
Although one might expect his
popularity with the ladies to inspire
jealously in the male populace, Chris
was instead universally beloved by all.
Hangman interviewed an
anonymous Felix Editor, who told us
“I love Chris! He was my favourite
sabb, because he always took the time
to go for a cheeky pint in the Union,
whatever the time of day.
“No hour was too early for Chris
to have a cheeky pint. He was a man
after my own heart.”
While walking through the College,
Chris often found himself being
followed by his legions of adoring
fans.
It was this which ultimately proved
to be his downfall, as one day the
crowd following him grew too large.
It all started out like a normal day
for Chris, until word got around
campus that he had been spotted.
With the majority of students having
finished exams, there was a far greater
number available to hound him.
The police were called to control
the throngs, with some suggesting
that the army should have been
called in due to the sheer number of
people desperately attempting to get a
glimpse of their idol, Chris Kaye.
Chris was initially believed to
have been killed in the crush, but he
has reportedly made a miraculous
recovery in hospital.
Hangman looks forward to seeing
Chris next year, and hopes that no
mysterious or unfortunate accidents
befall him at the end of the next
academic year.
So, we have no idea what to write
about Pascal, also known as the
‘International Man of Mystery’
or ‘Pascal? Who’s that?’
He was apparently the Deputy
President (Education), but sources
close to Hangman confirmed that
very few students were actually sure
this was the case.
Pascal was most famous for
his work as the pretty face of the
Sabbatical team, bringing his dashing
good looks and winning smile to his
job.
Unfortunately, that winning smile
was wiped off his face when he made
his final, fatal mistake: visiting the
Felix Office.
While engaging with student media
(an activity often frowned upon), he
made the mistake of venturing too
close to one of the overladen shelves
lining the office, filled with bound
editions of Felix past.
With barely a nudge, the shelves
collapsed, causing the books to crash
to the floor, covering Pascal.
He was killed instantly, with his last
sight that of one of the many, many
Felix centrefolds.
We hope he enjoyed it.
We don’t really have anything
else to say, so here’s another picture.
No context provided, because that’s
Pascal for you. Mysterious until the
end.
News in Brief: Urban dictionary says a ‘Skett’ is “A fat,
sweaty, disgusting girl that nobody wants to be with.”
