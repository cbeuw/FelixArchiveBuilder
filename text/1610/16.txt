When Diversity Becomes Adversity
“London is a world-class
international city with
people coming from
diverse cultures and backgrounds.
This, I believe, will allow me to
enhance my communicative skills
and learn to adjust myself to different
environments.”
This is the sentence I used in the
personal statement for applying for
Imperial College London last year.
Yes, back then, I was just a little boy
who always looked at the best side of
living in a society which is hugely,
giganticly, enormously, colossally,
tremendously (whatever word you
want to choose) diverse. Now, that I
have seen some of the less good side,
my views are changed.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m not an
anti-social person or a xenophobe
who is scared of looking into a
foreigner’s eyes. I enjoy living in
a diverse society as much as many
of you and I still believe that being
able to adapt yourself to this kind of
environment is one of the key skills
to your success in professional and
everyday life.
Yet, it is also this diversity that
can breed problems. Being part of a
diverse community can also cause a
lot of pressure, and that can lead into
mental breakdown or depression.
Therefore, this article will point out
the dark sides of living in a highly
diverse society and how to tackle with
these problems.
From my experience, there are
always three common problems from
living in a diverse city wherever in
the world.
Culture Shock
From where I’m from, bargaining the
price is very common and we do it
all the time. But once, I tried this in
another country and the shop seller
pointed the finger at me and threw
me out of the shop straight away.
Stunned for five seconds, I learnt
later that it was considered rude to
bargain the price there.
This is what I mean by culture
shock and it has happened to me
in London. Cultural difference is a
very common thing. Even you and
your siblings might prefer different
kinds of music. It is normal that
people from different backgrounds or
origins will have different norms, and
these can sometimes contradict one
another quite spectacularly.
What I do to avoid this problem
is to assume that people will not
always approach things in the same
way I do. You can be surprised but
don’t be shocked. Once you do not
Not everything about diversity is always inspiring and positive. It can be a scary and alienating experience.

Pheerawat Ratnitisakul discusses about the lows of
diversity in London’s Melting Pot
"Sometimes
I feel lost
among
people and
feel that
no one will
understand
me."

part of a
diverse
community
can also

pressure."
have expectations based on your own
culture, you will not be shaken or
disappointed. Instead, everything you
see will be a new discovery for you!
Discrimination
Racism, unfair treatment or insult,
don’t let that get the best of you!
In a diverse culture, people can be
very judgmental of others that are
different from them. This is because
people can feel insecure when
hanging around people they are not
familiar with. So, they create a kind of
barrier against the unfamiliar so that
they can feel safe in their comfort
zone.
Sometimes, the prejudice is not
even malicious, but still painful to
be misunderstood. It can be just an
offhand comment that makes you
wonder if you’re a walking stereotype.
Never ever let it discourage you!
Remember, you did nothing wrong
and have no reason to feel bad about
yourself. Prove to yourself that you
are not what they think you are. But
if they are still ignorant of this, who
cares! They’re not the only people
in the world and there’re no good
reasons for you to pay attention to
these people for any longer.
Loneliness
Ironically, I find that living in a
place where there is a lot of diversity
can often be a lonely experience.
Sometimes, I feel lost among people
and feel that no-one will understand
me. But don’t worry! You feel that
way because you’re out of your
comfort zone with the people similar
to you.
No-one but yourself can solve this
problem. Change your attitude and
create your own comfort zone in this
diversity! Change from the comfort
zone that consists of people from the
same country into a zone consisting
of people with similar interests or
passions such as learning languages
and playing tennis. This way, you
will feel more secure by knowing that
there’re still people who like the same
things you do!
Living among people from
different cultures and backgrounds
can be difficult, especially in such
diverse city like London. But if you
understand problems that can occur
in a diverse setting, you will be better
prepared for it. I hope that this article
will be useful to you and help you
make the best of living in this city.
