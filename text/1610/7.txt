George Butcher thinks that someone needs these “useless occupations”
We are responsible for finding
opportunities for ourselves
Are you being “lovebombed”
by graduate employers?
Do you feel pressured into
taking a job in The City? Are you
feeling forced to embark on a career
that will force you to work 17 hour
days for an uncaring capitalist? This
is what George Monbiot and John
Sheil have said in The Guardian
and London Student recently. They
say that students need protecting
from the influence of recruiters
using “lovebombing of the kind
that cults use” and that universities’
careers services are perpetuating the
problem. I guess we must be doomed
to a life of slaving away for a greedy
corporate master.
This is patronising and
misleading. If students from
“leading universities” are these
great intellectual people that they
think we are, then we are perfectly
capable of making rational and
informed decisions about the career
we take up. What Monbiot and
Sheil fail to understand is that some
people genuinely want to work in
“Finance, management consultancy,
advertising, public relations [and]
lobbying” – all jobs that Monbiot
decries as “useless occupations”. I
hate to break it to The Guardian, but
those are all jobs that our economy
depends upon. Admittedly it’d be nice
if finance was regulated effectively
so that it didn’t blow up the economy
every couple of decades, but these are
all industries that generate revenue
for the treasury that fund public
services we all use. Perhaps he’d
prefer it if we all got jobs that allow us
to, “seek enlightenment, intellectual
or spiritual; to do good; to love and be
loved; to create and to teach” which
presumably is what his Guardian
column is designed to do, but sadly
someone needs to be an accountant
as well.
In another article, Monbiot quotes
a “Barclays analyst” who said, “We
expect you to be the last ones to
leave every night, no matter what … I
recommend bringing a pillow to the
office – it makes sleeping under your
desk a lot more comfortable”. What
he doesn’t mention is that this was
a satirical email which also said to
“have a tie/scarf around, you’ll never
know when your associate needs a
handkerchief”. There are concerns at
some banks that their interns work
too many hours in an attempt to
impress, but increasingly this is being
addressed by companies who want
healthy employees. There will always
be those who are very ambitious in
the industries that pay the best, and
for the salaries you get paid in the
financial sector, you expect to work
long hours. This is fine if you love the
job, which some people genuinely do.
I’m just a humble engineer. I’m
going to be designing medical devices
when I graduate; it sounds very moral
and enlightened, but think about it
too hard and I’m basically making
a profit from others’ illnesses. Not
so great now, is it? Taking a moral
position on someone’s employment
choice is impossible to do. Is the
creative writer or artist a better
person than the accountant or
businessman? Many would tell you
so, but they are ignorant of the work
these people do and how important
it is to the economy we all live in.
It’s easy for someone who is talented
enough at writing to be printed in a
national newspaper to take a swipe at
people who work in less glamorous
industries, but without the support
of these big corporations, newspapers
like The Guardian couldn’t exist.
At the same time, of course we
want creative people. We want some
people to shun The City, work for
charities, invent things, entertain us
and make life worth living. But these
people shouldn’t be snobby about
those who don’t chose this path. A
society of artists and intellectuals is as
dystopian as a society of bankers and
advertisers. It just wouldn’t work.
Monbiot and Sheil don’t
just criticise students’ choices
though; their biggest targets are
the universities who should be
“protecting” us. Sheil says that
careers departments “were either so
intellectually moribund that they
had not contemplated the question of
the general purpose of a university”.
I don’t want my careers department
to be full of intellectuals who start

Grace Rahman is looking forward to
taking the helm as editor-in-chief
I am (finally) Felix
Hello, hi. I’m Grace, current
music editor, and next year’s
editor-in-chief. Or as I’m
renaming the position, Philippa-in-
chief. I don’t want to get too soppy in
this, the last issue of Skett’s tenure but
I can’t fight it. Our output has been
astonishing this year, if we do say so
ourselves.
As is usual, the news has been
unpredictable, but Philippa
and the whole team have dealt
with everything in the classiest
way possible, with the utmost
professionalism (vom). The sleepless
nights she spends in our subterranean
lair, working on the latest issue,
hopefully don’t go unnoticed by
you, the student body, and I hope
we’ve served your need for unbiased,
Imperial-focussed news and
amusement.
After the summer, I’m hoping that
we’ll have a shiny new website for
your consumption, more photos to go
with our stories, and more stuff that
you want to read. So if you can help
with any of that, or just fancy coming
to the socials, don’t hesitate to get in
touch next year (or now, I have a lot of
free time). This time last year I’d only
written one shoddy article for the
paper and look at me now! Writing an
editorial the night before publication,
I am truly a member of Felix. I wish
I’d done it sooner.
I only really started getting
involved with the paper this year
and became music editor on a bit of
a whim. The fact that six months in
I felt able to run for editorship is a
credit to the friendliness and support
of the team. Yes I ran unopposed, but
I’d like to invite the 300 or so people
who RON’d me to get in touch; I want
to buy you a soda lime and ask what
I can do to reassure you. Thanks for
voting for me in though chums; I
genuinely never dreamt that little ol’
me would be allowed to make you a
paper, and I am so incredibly grateful.
As the production team turn up
the music, to politely hint that I
should finish this speech, I just want
to reiterate the openness of Felix. If
you’re a club, an illustrator, writer,
photographer, reader or speaker of
words, or a human person, come and
say hello to us in the office in the
west basement at Beit. It’s clearly
signposted but if you get lost or that
seems too informal, you can send an
e-mail to the Felix account advertised
multiple times in this issue and share
your thoughts, gripes or ideas for
next year. I want to hear from you!
Professionally, but also because a lot
of my friends are leaving. Trag.
questioning me about the true
meaning of a higher education, I just
want my CV to be checked over and to
be given some interview advice. Their
job is to help with “careers”. If I want
an intellectual discussion, I am happy
to, and am capable of going elsewhere.
We do need to make informed
decisions about our life, and
admittedly if you go to a careers
fair you can leave with the
impression that all there is to do is
to be a consultant or banker. This
is not the case, but you need to take
responsibility yourself for exploring
the world you live in. It’s unfair to
expect a careers service to present
every possible “career path”, you have
to look for it yourself. In London
we’re fortunate to have access to a
huge wealth of industries. Other
universities look on with jealousy at
the access and proximity we have to
employers in all types of industries.
Go out there and find them yourself –
you don’t need me to tell you that.
I have something to admit: Last
year I had doubts that the then
Deputy President (Welfare) elect
would do a good job,and I even
wrote an article for Felix about it.I
worried that he would not take his
role seriously,and that his dislike
of bureaucracy would get in the
way of working as an effective
sabbatical officer.
Regular readers of Felix will
know Chris as Kris Kraye,a
fictionalised character devised by
our editor,but the real Chris Kaye
has exceeded all expectations,
doing great work throughout
the year to really make a
difference for students.Who
can forget his work on feminine
hygiene products,ensuring their
availability at reasonable prices
free of VAT; or his room-swap
scheme,through which students
in halls can change rooms
ensuring they have affordable,
comfortable accommodation with
good company?
Chris has worked constructively
to deliver sensible,practical
changes.He has not fallen into the
trap of spending too much time
on grandiose ambitions (single-
handedly eliminating tuition fees,
for example),and has identified
issues that he can and has been
able to do something about,
reducing stress and anxiety and
helping improve the welfare of
students.I am hopeful that he will
continue this next year as DP(FS).

He’s OKaye
really
This year has been a really exciting
time to be Comment editor.We
have,as always,had some articles
that have been written with
purely contrary opinions,almost
certainly written with the sole
purpose of drawing a response,
but for the most part,I’m so proud
that most of the articles I’ve put in
Felix this year are from people who
honestly want to put it out there
that something is wrong,with no
aim other than to educate people
about it,to start a discussion,or to
change people’s minds.As Angry
Geek wrote in his wonderful
comeback (honestly,I can die
happy now),the Comment section
is hearteningly full of good people
writing about important issues.
I’m really excited to work with
Grace next year.Both editors-in-
chief I’ve worked with so far have
been amazing,and have had
different approaches towards
the controversial articles that
sometimes land in my inbox.It’s
easy to just not print articles that
are a bit too contentious,but the
point of an opinion section is to
push the boundaries,and with
the help of the esteemed editors-
in-chief,we aim to bring you as
many opinions as we can without
getting sued.
This is the end of my second year
as Comment editor,and I hope
I’ve done you proud in finding
articles for you to read every week.
I’ll still be here in next Autumn
term,ready to do it all again,but
we need new writers and editors
as well.Please,if you want to help,
or if you think you can do a better
job,get in touch.We’re always
happy to hear from you!
