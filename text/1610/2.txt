the year out with one last on-
campus all-nighter.

Is play. Come see. Is free. Fun

CORRECTIONS
We would like to apologise for
any confusion caused by the
usage of the image to illustrate
the front cover last week. The
the lecture taking place was not
related to the story.
T
his is my final editorial,
which is slightly bittersweet
to write. It has been a year
that has passed incredibly
quickly overall, but punctuated with
long nights, fits and bursts of activity
and, generally, one that has left me a
little bit tired, to be honest.
I’ve enjoyed this year as editor of
the newspaper immensely: there have
been times where an odd email, angry
student encounter or stressful story
has left me a bit down and out, but
overall, I will look back on my year
editing this paper fondly.
I’ve learnt an incredible amount
about not just how to run a newspaper
and put together stories for you all
to read, but also a lot about leading a
team of volunteers to produce a paper
we are hopefully pleased about every
week.
We were shortlisted for Club of the
Year at the Union Awards this week,
something that made me feel very
proud of the club I run and the people
who make it such a joy to come into
work each day. My work colleagues
are also my friends, and I hope that
the people who have ventured down
to the basement to join in with the
team are friends I will carry with me
after I (probably) leave Imperial at the
end of this Summer.
This year has been incredibly
eventful in terms of news stories;
we’ve ran front-page pieces on
students smashing windows through
to student surveys, paedophiles
through to sporting mishaps, and
everything in between.
In the office, we’ve drank thousands
of cans of diet coke, argued over
commas, covered the walls in
centrefolds, had Chris Kaye pass out
on the floor and we are still yet to take
down our Christmas decorations. For
about three days we had stick insects,
but I think we fed them the wrong
leaves, and they died. I’ve had a lot of
fun, and am very aware as I write this
that this may be the best job a 23-year
old avoiding the real world could ever
have, not just because I can nap on a
Friday or watch Netflix and no-one
tells me off.
We hope that we’ve brought news
to you that has made you more
informed about your life whilst at
Imperial, more critical of things that
are going on around you and started a
dialogue about some of the big issues
that students and staff alike face
whilst at this university. It never fails
to elate me when students come to the
office, asking us to investigate stories
that they feel need to be shared, and
seeing the positive results our stories
can have on the wider community.
But obviously it is not all about the
news. We have had some amazing
content this year beyond the red-
topped pages at the front of Felix.
Arts as a section has been incredible,
pumping out high quality on a weekly
basis, alongside resurrecting and
restoring the Phoenix magazine. I am
so proud of Fred and Kamil, and their
dedication to the team and the paper
as a whole.
In fact, none of this year could have
even started without my amazing
editorial team. All of them have
put in so many hours of work, and
contributed probably hundreds of
pounds to takeaways as we’ve put
together 29 issues throughout the
year. I remember the first time I was
blown away by student dedication;
it was when we attempted to bring
together the first issue of the term,
and I was still working at dawn, with
other students with me.
Since then it never fails to amaze
me when others are in the office
at 3am, when students can write
hundreds of words on the topics
they love and when students will
spend hours researching and putting
together stories. It’s incredible that
over 200 students have contributed to
this paper this year, all of whom are
listed on the back page.
I am excited to see what Grace will
do with Felix next year, and wish her
the best of luck. It is an incredibly
steep learning curve, and it seems
just as I was getting the hang of this
newspaper lark I’ll need to return
back to student life and finish my
dissertation. I will miss the office,
the people, the challenges and the
satisfaction that comes every Friday
when I see people reading the paper.
Which brings us to you, the readers.
I would love to thank all of you that
have picked up a copy on a Friday,
even if it is just to do the puzzles or
have a sneak peak at the centrefold.
I’ve always said that Felix has a dual
purpose: for students to have an
opportunity to make a paper, and
then to provide a paper to read.
I hope you all have enjoyed reading
our work as much as we did making
it, and if you want to get involved,
please come down the basement
and pay us a visit next year. We
are a pretty pleasant bunch; we eat
a lot of chocolate, drink a bit too
much sometimes and on Friday we
like to visit Nandos. We are always
looking for more to join our rather
dysfunctional family, so get in touch.
Building up the courage to come
down to the office three years ago was
the best thing I’ve ever done. I cannot
recommend it highly enough.
Felix would like to thank everyone who has
contributed to the publication this year, this paper
would not be possible without you!
