Ellen Mathieson takes a trip to the re-opening of Jurassic Park
It’s all about that Rex (no pteranodon)
First things first, it’s not as good
as Jurassic Park. And really it
never was going to compare to
the original.
It’s battling years of love and
nostalgia, and the film that inspired
countless people to spend at least a
couple of years as a kid wanting to be
an archaeologist (usually somewhere
before astronaut but after princess).
It is the film that made dinosaurs
into a thing, much as Jaws made
people fear sharks.
With all that’s going for the
original, it’s totally unfair to make
Jurassic World compete. The best it’ll
ever do is ‘The second-best Jurassic
Park film’.
But if you look at it as a summer
blockbuster, a big, dumb dinosaur
film that is hugely enjoyable to watch,
it hits the nail on the head.
I have not seen a film I have
enjoyed this much in a very long
time. Because that is entirely what the
film is trying to do.
Pointless reboot is a term that gets
flung around a lot these days, but in
Jurassic World’s case, it just isn’t true.
It’s not a reboot. It’s a clever sequel.
The new park is now open to the
world, full of dinosaurs and lots of
yummy tourists to eat, attack and
maim as the plot deems appropriate.
You’ve got little baby herbivore
dinosaurs to go riding on, or you can
watch a big, scary water dinosaur eat
an entire shark.
If aquatic dinosaurs don’t do it
for you, why not go and watch the
T-Rex get fed? Or go explore the
enclosures of some of the more
laid-back dinosaurs in your very own
personable bubble, complete with
annoying tour guide video.
For characters we’ve got the
guy who knows everything about
dinosaurs, Owen (Chris Pratt in
one of his many hero roles after
Guardians of the Galaxy made us
realise that he’s actually kinda hot),
and the woman who is sort of knows
things but is mostly there to be a
love interest (Bryce Dallas Howard)
with questionable fashion choices
(seriously, who decides to wear heels
when you might be running away
from a big hungry dinosaur).
There’s also the rich old man who
owns the park, and the obligatory
annoying kids, who actually manage
to not be too annoying due the fact
that the film makers realised that if
all the kids do is cry and scream no-
one is going to like your film.
The film’s plot is kicked off when,
in a bid to make an even more
exciting exhibit to get the tourists
come flooding in, the scientists design
their own dinosuar.
The Indominus Rex is pretty much
a big T-Rex without the hilariously
stunted arms, and it is awesome to
look to look at.
Of course, Indy doesn’t much like
being locked up, so she escapes. And
that’s when everything goes majorly
wrong, and where the film goes so
right.
Jurassic Park could focus on its
characters because there were so few
people in danger.
Now we’re talking thousands rather
than ten, and there is death and
destruction galore.
The main focus of the film is the
dinosaurs.
Almost everything the humans
do is pretty much just so you can see
more of the dinosaurs.
You’ve got dinosaurs fighting
dinosaurs, dinosaurs killing
dinosaurs, dinosaurs eating
dinosaurs, dinosaurs freeing
dinosaurs to cause even more
problems in the park. You’ve got
dinosaurs killing, eating, chasing,
scaring and exciting people. And then
you’ve got people training dinosaurs.
When the first trailers dropped and
people saw the raptors being trained,
pretty much no-one liked the idea.
But the film pulls it off excellently,
with the raptors still having the same
threat they always did, you’re just way
more attached to them.
Nods to the original are plentiful
but never overdone. This film is set
twenty-odd years in the future on the
same island as the original.
The line where the new owner
recalls how John Hammond told
him to ‘spare no expense’ is fantastic,
and visiting the old visitor centre is
enjoyable for people who have seen
the original film, but it is also a cool,
creepy setting that new viewer will
find just as interesting.
There really are only a couple of
issues with the film.
InGen as a secondary villain
seems tacked on and a bit pointless.
With such a strong primary villain
(y’know, the dinosaur) having a
second one felt more like sequel bait
than actually adding to the film.
The other is the lack of feathers.
Just as Jurassic Park firmly implanted
dinosaurs in the public’s mind, this
film could have done the same with
feathers.
Though it’s a shame that they
ultimately decided against doing this,
it does not actually detract from the
film in any major way.
Jurassic World is a hugely enjoyable
film filled with exactly what you
want, tons and tons of dinosaurs.
It doesn’t do anything particularly
clever with characters, or story.
It’s probably not going to win any
Oscars (though the special effects
could get a nod), but it’s not trying to.
It’s trying to be fun, and if you are a
kid you are going to enjoy this just as
much as the original. And really, isn’t
that the point?

Jack Steadman gets ready for the next batch of blockbusters
Summer of cinema
With the summer upon us,
it means the inevitable
onslaught of blockbusters.
By normal standards, 2015’s a
pretty quiet year for the summer,
with most of this year’s big hitters
either already out, or landing towards
Christmas time (Star Wars, I’m
looking at you).
But don’t worry – once you’ve
finally made your way through
the likes of Mad Max: Fury Road
(seriously, go and watch it again
already) and Jurassic World (I have
no opinions on this yet), there’s still
plenty of cinema to indulge in.
We’ve got unnecessary reboots
(Terminator), yet more sequels (Ted),
the odd genuinely exciting new work
(Inside Out) and plenty more besides.
We also have a healthy dose of
sarcasm about all of them, because
that’s just how we roll.
Minions (26th
June)
As if your life wasn’t already
overflowing with the yellow critters
from the Despicable Me series, they’re
back in an all-new film of their own.
That’s right, there’s a whole film
comprised exclusively of the barely
comprehensible, impossibly idiotic
Minions. Because stealing the show
in two films and commanding an
entire series of adverts for Sky weren’t
enough. Thanks, Universal.
Having said that, this’ll probably
still be fairly amusing. Minions,
despite being literally everywhere, are
still funny.
Terminator Genisys (3rd
July)
Did somebody say “unnecessary
reboot”? I mean, I definitely did, but
just in case someone else felt like
chiming in with that opinion. Because
that’s what we’re getting.
The Terminator franchise lumbers
back to life following two attempted
murders via film – the so-so third
entry (Rise of the Machines) and the
downright dire Terminator Salvation.
Despite director McG’s best efforts,
the series survives. And it’s bringing
back the original Terminator, for real
this time.
It’s also completely changing
the game, ending up in a sort of
parallel universe where the original
Terminator brought up an orphaned
Sarah Connor (now played by Emilia
Clarke). So there’s that.
Trailers for the film have done
their best to spoil all of the major
plot twists, but hopefully there’s still
something up the sleeve of director
Alan Taylor, fresh off the likes of
Game of Thrones and Thor: The Dark
World. Clearly not a dictionary,
however.
Ted 2 (10th
July)
Seth MacFarlane’s foul-mouthed
teddy bear makes his second
appearance in the inevitable sequel to
the hit comedy.
The likes of Liam Neeson and
Amanda Seyfried join the cast, with
the latter playing a lawyer whose
name bears an uncanny resemblance
to another popular film star. Mark
Wahlberg returns as Ted’s “thunder
buddy for life” John, although Mila
Kunis opts not to reappear as his
girlfriend. Fair enough.
The film is set to centre around
Ted’s attempts to have a baby with his
(human) girlfriend, and his need to
prove he is a person in the eyes of the
law before this is allowed. Whether
you enjoy it or not is likely to depend
on your opinions of the first film, of
Family Guy, and of Seth MacFarlane’s
work in general.
Ant-Man (17th
July)
Admit it, you forgot this was coming
out, didn’t you? Originally the work
of Edgar Wright, the latest Marvel
film (and the first of Phase 3) is now
under the command of Peyton Reed,
the man behind Yes Man.
Not the most promising of CVs, but
the latest trailer suggests there’s much
to be hopeful for.
Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang is a
criminal, but one given a chance at
redemption by scientist Dr Hank
Pym. Armed with a suit that allows
him to shrink (but increase his
strength in the process), he’s tasked
with carrying out a heist like no other.
Ant-Man looks to be one of the
Marvel films that leans more
heavily towards the comedy side of
things, if Thomas the Tank Engine’s
appearance in the trailer is anything
to go by, and there’s still plenty to be
hopeful for. Marvel haven’t put a foot
wrong yet.
Inside Out (24th
July)
Pixar haven’t been on their best form
of late, trapped as they are in the land
of sequels. The fact that Inside Out
is a new IP from some of cinema’s
greatest minds should be exciting
enough. The fact that the early
reviews are already declaring it to be
amongst Pixar’s finest work – a heady
claim – should be even more so.
Set inside the mind of Riley,
an 11 year-old-girl, Inside Out
follows the personifications of the
emotions inside her head, lead by
Joy (Amy Poehler). After a move
across the States, Joy and Sadness
find themselves trapped in the far
corners of Riley’s mind, and Anger,
Fear and Disgust are left in charge in
Headquarters.
