Joshua Renken discusses the potential leaders of the major parties
The leadership races to watch over
the Summer
Four candidates will be on the
ballot paper when Labour
Party members get to vote
on Ed Miliband’s successor in
September. Nominations closed on
Wednesday and Shadow Secretary
of State for Health Andy Burnham
is the bookies’ favourite. Burnham
received 68 nominations from MPs
(the minimum to be on the ballot
was 35), Yvette Cooper achieved 59,
Jeremy Corbyn 36 and Liz Kendall 41,
with 25 MPs – including Ed Miliband
and deputy leader Harriet Harman –
deciding not to vote.
The veteran Labour MP Jeremy
Corbyn is the most left-wing of the
candidates, while Andy Burnham and
the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette
Cooper are seen more as continuation
candidates, struggling to distance
themselves from one another in a
fight for the top job in the centre-left
party.
Chuka Umunna – the Shadow
Business secretary who put himself
as a leadership candidate early on
and was reportedly backed by the
former PM Tony Blair – withdrew his
leadership bid and publicly backed
Liz Kendall. Kendall is seen as a “blue
Labour” moderniser – subscribing to
the “Third Way” centrist approach
that tries to reconcile right and left-
wing politics on a populist platform.
It has served party leaders well in the
past, including Blair and the former
US President Bill Clinton.
Mary Creagh was unable to secure
the support she needed and dropped
out without nominating any of the
other candidates.
Labour’s deputy leadership shortlist
has also been finalised: Tom Watson,
Caroline Flint, Ben Bradshaw, Stella
Creasy and Angela Eagle will compete
to replace Harriet Harman.
Following the poor performance of
the Liberal Democrats in the general
election last May, Nick Clegg stepped
down as leader.
Now only eight Lib Dem MPs
remain in the House of Commons –
two of which are standing to succeed
Clegg.
Norman Lamb has been MP for
North Norfolk since 2001 and was
Minister of State for Care and Support
for three years in the coalition. Lamb
is considered more of the continuity
leader than his opponent.
The second candidate, former
President of the Liberal Democrats
and MP for Westmorland and
Lonsdale is Tim Farron, who seems
almost certain to win the leadership
bid, given his track record of winning
big in his elections and the fact that
he is not ‘tainted’ by involvement in
the Conservative-Liberal Democrat
coalition government. Tim Farron
has gained strong support from
prominent members of the party
and is seen as more left-wing than
Nick Clegg, making any possibile
future colaition proposals with the
Conservatives far less likely.
Farron voted very strongly against
increasing the cap on undergraduate
tuition fees from £3,000 to £9,000,
and voted in favour of allowing
marriage between two people of
same sex at the second reading of the
Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.
However, he did not vote for equal
marriage on the third reading of
the Bill, which he put down to his
religious upbringing. Unlike Clegg,
who is an agnostic, Farron is a
church-going Anglican.
2016 Mayor of London candidates
incumbent Mayor Boris Johnson has
chosen not to run for re-election for
a third term in office as he is instead
now the Conservative Party Member

of Parliament for Uxbridge and
South Ruislip. He has announced his
intention to remain Mayor until his
term ends in May 2016.
Several party members have
announced their candidacy for the
Conservative and Labour parties,
with just one official candidate for
the Liberal Democrats: the leader of
the party in the London Assembly,
Caroline Pidgeon.
And the controversial broadcaster,
writer and former MP for Bradford
West George Galloway has thrown his
hat in the ring as the Respect Party
candidate.
However, with the Richmond MP
Zac Goldsmith formally announcing
his candidacy for the Conservative
Party’s bid for Mayor of London,
the media have been buzzing and
Goldsmith – an Old Etonian who got
kicked out for smoking cannabis and
is the former editor of the Ecologist –
is considered the strongest option for
the Tories.
Other Conservative candidates
include the British businessman and
the first and current Deputy Mayor
for Policing and Crime in London
Stephen Greenhalgh, and the former
footballer Sol Campbell.
Labour’s candidates are almost all
current London MPs, but the former
Olympics Minister and MP for
Dulwich and West Norwood Dame
Tessa Jowell is presently deemed the
frontrunner. The former Shadow
Minister for Public Health and
current MP for Hackney North and
Stoke Newington Diane Abbott and
former Universities Minsiter and MP
for Tottenham David Lammy have
put their names on the ballot sheet,
with Tooting MP Sadiq Khan also
proving popular with Londoners.
People have already started
speculating as to whom will succeed
David Cameron as leader of the
Conservative Party after Prime
Minister David Cameron said he
would step down before the 2020
election.
Four MPs are in contention – three
of which are currently in cabinet.
George Osborne, current Chancellor
of the Exchequer and First Secretary
of State (making him the de facto
Deputy Prime Minster), has solid
support from the party and is seen as
Cameron’s natural successor.
The Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills Sajid Javid
is also in contention, with growing
support from party activists.
The Mayor of London Boris
Johnson is currently the frontrunner
to succeed Cameron, as he re-entered
parliament in May. His widespread
popularity with the public – and
lack of connection with the coalition
government – make him strong
choice for Conservatives.
The Home Secretary Theresa May
was at one point a strong contender
as the only female candidate, but
in recent months her chances have
been gradually slipping away to
her competitors. Her leadership
bid looks less and less credible in a
field swarmed with other ambitious
cabinet ministers.
No candidate will have to officially
declare their candidacy until we
are much closer to 2020, but with
Cameron announcing his resignation
plans so far in advance, we can rest
assured that the frontrunners are
already plotting to gain the support of
the party.
