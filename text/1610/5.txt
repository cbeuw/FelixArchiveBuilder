Gloria Rosetto won the award
for the Community Connections
volunteer of the year, while the
CAG Soup Run won Community
Connections project of the year.
Speaking about her award, Rosetto
said “It has been a great pleasure for
me to volunteer at Imperial, and I
plan to continue doing so next year.
Although volunteering itself is the
greatest reward, I am glad to have
received this award and I hope it will
encourage more first-year students
to participate in the wide variety of
opportunities offered at Imperial.
Beyond our studies, these experiences
are also very valuable as they allow
you to have a positive impact on the
community and society at large.”
Jessica Wade, who won the award
for Contribution to College Life, said
“Winning the Imperial Contribution
to College Life award meant more to
me than I can express in words – I’ve
been at Imperial College since 2008
and I’ve never felt as special as that.
The more I get to know Imperial the
more I love it and @WIP_IC is a way
for me to set up a support network
for all the women in the physics
department so they can all like feel
this.”
The Innovation and Enterprise
award was given to ICTV. Pete Brook,
ICTV’s Station Manager, said “So
many people have put in so many
hours to make ICTV what it is this
year. Live show producers, directors
for our shorts and all the tech people
who’ve made stuff work. We are really
grateful to all the people in the club
and the union for all their support
and hard work!”
Mechanical Engineering Academic
Representative Rory O’Keeffe won
the Academic Rep of the Year award.
Speaking to Felix afterwards, O’Keeffe
said “Having been part of the rep
system for the last three years, it is
great to know the work I have done
has been appreciated. I would like to
give a special mention to my team
of Year Reps from the Mechanical
Engineering Department, who have
been a massive help throughout the
year, I certainly wouldn’t have done it
without their support, and for that I
would like to thank them.”
The Postgraduate Academic
Rep Team of the Year Award was
presented to the Graduate Student
Union’s Academic and Welfare
team. A member of the GSU rep
team, Mike Asavarut, said “This
award represents the partnership
that the GSU Academic and Welfare
Officers have with the union, college
and especially the Graduate School.
Making representation effective is a
daunting task, given the unique needs
that each department and faculty
have. One size does not fit all, and
the GSU representation team have
certainly given their best to represent
the postgraduate student body at all
levels.”
The undergraduate equivalent was
given to the Physics department’s
rep team, who have now won
three times in the last five years.
They said about their award “The
Undergraduate Academic rep team
for Physics is immensely pleased
that the Union has again decided to
recognise their dedication to strong
student representation within the
department. This is the third year in
the past five that the Physics rep team
has been given this award, which
reflects the culture of strong student
engagement in the undergraduate
experience that is present in the
student body of the department. We
are all very pleased that the students
recognise the effort that we put into
ensuring that their voices are heard
by the department on the issues that
affect them.”
Other awards included the
campaign of the year award, which
was presented to Mentality, who ran
a survey last month that found that
three in four Imperial students suffer
from stress or a mental condition.
Speaking after receiving their award
for the club of the year, the Islamic
society said “Muslim students are one
of the most active students on campus
(sic). Over 10 of our integral members
were awarded colours and awards, and
the Imperial Islamic Society was also
Kunal Wagle reports after awards night celebrates achievements of Union
clubs, societies and projects
awarded a national award for ‘Best
Society’ by Federation of Student
Islamic Societies (FOSIS). With all the
things in the media, it’s important to
highlight the success of Muslims and
also realise that the future is brighter
than ever before!”
In her blog on the Imperial College
Union website, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) Abi de Bruin
said “Felix has made a significant
contribution to student life, not only
for those that read it but for those
that create it too. Since Imperial is
an all-science university, it can be
difficult for people to engage with
other projects, such as writing or
culture and Felix has provided that
outlet in an inviting atmosphere.
They have also successfully covered
a number of high profile issues that
directly impact the student body.
“Overall it’s been an incredible year
for the Union and I’m so thankful
and proud of all of the students that
have poured so much time and effort
into making the Union so amazing.
We really wouldn’t be what we are
without you guys!”
