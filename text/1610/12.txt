Grace Rahman reflects on the events of a year that hasn’t really ended
The year’s biggest moments in music
No one else thinks it’s the end
of the year, but we’re going
to summarise the best, worst
and most important moments in
music of this year. So while you spent
the year locked in labs, cramming
or pretending to do your FYP, you
might have missed the following.
The Feminist Moment
While the movie industry offered
Patricia Arquette’s speech at the
Oscars to put the subject of equal pay
in the spotlight, Björk’s interview
with Pitchfork did something
similar within music. The Icelandic
singer-songwriter drew attention
to the subject of rightful crediting
and the way she’s seen this handled
differently between male and female
artists. Whilst discussing her album,
Vulnicura, she remarked that multiple
sources had incorrectly reported that
her co-producer, Alejandro Ghersi,
had been completely behind the beats
on the record. “If whatever I’m saying
to you now helps women,” she told
Pitchfork, “then I’m up for doing it,”
before pointing out that no one would
ever accuse Kanye West of not being
the master of his own sound, despite
undoubtably bringing in outside
help. Perhaps applicable in a wide
range of industries were Bjork’s views
on the way society treats opinions
dependent on the gender of the
source. “Everything a guys says once,
you have to say five times”.
The Moment that broke a
million hearts
Despite not having mentioned One
Direction in this section all year, we
at Felix Music appreciate that they are
the biggest band on the planet, and
loss of quiet dreamboat Zayn has to
be included in a round up of the year’s
events. Regardless of your personal
opinions on the band’s output, or love
lives, this was the Geri leaving Spice
Girls, or Robbie leaving Take That,
of a generation. And in terms of fan
fallout, it was phenomenal. Since
there was no Twitter when Ginger
Spice hung up her Union Jack dress,
this was the first time a quick hashtag
search (Zaynwillalwaysbeapartof1D)
could reveal the reaction of a
whole army of young fans. Will the
institution survive? Will Harry go
next? Will the entertaining Twitter
spats continue? Only time will
tell.
Momentary Dickhead
What an end of year list be without a
Kanye West-ism? Especially coming
from Kanye himself. Almost in
homage to his 2009 stage invasion of
Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for
best female video at the Video Music
Awards in 2009, Kanye leapt onstage
when Beck accepted his Grammy for
album of the year.
Afterwards, Kanye told Ryan
Seacrest it was a joke and that “the
voices in my head told me to go”, but
confusingly, later said that Beck’s
win over Beyoncé was “disrespectful
to inspiration”. As a third and
final turnaround, Kanye tweeted
an apology to the singer, having
admitted he hadn’t listened to the
winning album when he made the
original comments. Apparently
taking the chance to get stuff off his
chest, Kanye subsequently tweeted
an apology to Bruno Mars who
he’d previously “hated on” but now
“respects what he does as an artist”.
Kanye, are you okay, hun?
The Trailblazer Moment
We’re cheekily including SIA,
because although she’s been around
for ages, and ‘Chandelier’ was
released in June of last year, her
profile, or lack therof, has really risen
in prominence within the last 12
months. In massive contrast to her
contemporaries, who don’t shy away
from incorperating their sexuality
into music, performances and videos,
SIA shuns this idea to the extreme,
choosing to hide her face. Red carpet
appearances have seen her don huge
wigs, during performances she will
have her back to the audience and her
videos consistently star the young
dance protégé, Maddie Ziegler. The
Australian singer isn’t new to the
business. She penned Rihanna’s
‘We Found Love’, Beyoncé’s ‘Pretty
Hurts’ and a load of others, as well
performing in her own right since
the 90s.
After decades in the industry,
pictures of her face do exist, and are
easily Googleable. The withdrawal of
such a key part of the artist’s identity
seems less about conserving privacy
and more about making a statement
on the source of the art. Go SIA!
Video of the Moment
Taylor Swift’s video for ‘Bad Blood’
broke the Vevo records, getting 20
million hits in its first 24 hours. This
was understandable given the massive
social media preamble Swift gave
her 34 million Instagram followers,
where promotional shots of each star
appeared at such a rate that Twtitter
wondered whether the whole thing
was an elaborate prank. The video
starred 15 of her famous friends
as well as collaborator Kendrick
Lamar and was directed by Joseph
Khan, who also did Britney Spear’s
‘Toxic’ vid. Given the combined
number of followers each of these
models, actresses and model/actresses
have, this huge number of views is
unsurprising. But the combination of
an iconic director, the most successful
models of the moment and a huge

you okay,

pop artist promoting the album of
her life make for a video, that beyond
the number of hits, is successful in its
very obvious intention of becoming
iconic.
Beef of the moment
Although by no means a new drama,
Azealia Banks and Iggy Azalea’s
swipes reached a new level in the
financial year ending 2015. After
several comments from Banks
about cultural appropriation,
similarities between their names
and the unsavoury Iggy lyric where
she calls herself a “runaway slave
master”, tensions were high. During
an interview with a New York
radio station, Banks became visibly
emotional when questioned about her
issues with Iggy, going straight into
her problems with appropriation,
which she calls “cultural smudging”.
Iggy then went beyond subtweeting,
putting out a “special mesg [sic] for
banks” where she blamed her rival’s
“piss poor attitude” for her issues with
the industry before deriding her for
“crying on the radio”. Ouch.
Moment of wonder
We didn’t want to end on a sad note
and Kate Bush’s theatrical return to
the stage last summer does deserve a
mention. Playing 22 nights is a feat in
itself, but the ‘Hounds of Love’ singer
seemed to please every attendee,
which for such a highly anticipated
return is a feat in itself.
