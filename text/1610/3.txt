Disaster struck on Saturday
afternoon when the
competition ran by Imperial
College Union to name a new student
bar was posted on the forum website
4chan, sparking thousands of entries
from the website users.
A link to the initially insecure
submission form for votes and other
potential name suggestions was
posted on the /b/ (“Random”) thread,
stating that:
“People of 4chan, I need your help.
“My university is trying to decide
its new bar name by online vote.
“Do your worst.”
One thread had the website users
supporting the motion to submit
repeatedly the name “The Patriarchy”
whilst another identical post
appeared and had posters suggesting
repeatedly that they were submitting
the name “No Juice Allowed.”
Between 1pm and 3pm over 2,000
submissions were made through the
page, with roughly 1,400 of those
being for the name “The Patriarchy.”
Various other names also suggested
ranged from trollish to offensive and
anti-sematic.
Users of the website turned
increasingly sinister as the threads
developed, posting screenshots of the
Facebook pages of Officer Trustees,
including Union President Tom
Wheeler, and emails and contact
numbers of the sabbatical staff,
encouraging others to “target them
too.”
One post encouraged others to book
out all the tables in the union bar
FiveSixEight, whilst another started
posting screenshots of the Officer
Trustees. Some people posted saying
they were also students at Imperial,
although many of the anonymous
posts on the threads seemed to be
made by people external to the
university. One user posted that they
had registered a campaign through
the Union website, called “Hitler did
nothing wrong.”
After the thread was brought to
the attention of Union staff, the
submission form was put behind
login entry, meaning afterwards
students could only vote once.
The Union website announced the
winning name, The Foundry, last
Wednesday, after discounting any
suggestions made during the period
of peak activity last weekend that
appeared to have originated from
4chan users.
Felix spoke to Chris Kaye Deputy
President (Welfare) and Deputy
President (Finance & Services) elect,
who will be working closely with the
bar next year. Chris told us: “When
someone posted the poll on 4chan on
Saturday, we took steps to limit the
poll to logged-in users only.
“Sadly we decided that their
name choices weren’t the best so we
discounted them, however we have
their IP addresses so we may see if we
can invite them down for the launch!”
The bar will be named “The
Foundry”, which received 100 votes,
followed closely by “Urban Oak,” that
received 96.
The Union stated on its website:
“The name is a great way to recognise
the history of the site where the new
hall of residence stands. From the
early 1920s right up until the mid
1980s the site was owned by Landi &
Gyrforming the site for their factory
and offices.
“The factory made “Elgee”
electricity meters and time switches.
Specifically the Elgee factory, just
like Woodward Hall, was cut into the
slope just west of Victoria Road.
“We are really excited to bring
you this new bar and restaurant in
conjunction with College Campus
Services and look forward to it
being an integral part of the student
experience for hall residents and
students who live nearby!”
Trolling surveys by 4chan users
is not new: a campaign run by
Mountain Dew back in 2012, called
“Dub the Dew” was hijacked. The
competition looked for people to
submit and vote for the name for a
new drink, with the name “Hitler did
nothing wrong” topping the charts
after the competition was posted.

Imperial launches two week, £3,500, summer school for GCSE and
A-Level students
Imperial is to host its first ever
“Global Summer School,” giving
under-eighteens a chance to live
and study at the university for two
weeks, at the cost of £3,500 a head,
considerably higher than those
offered at other universities.
The course, designed to attract “the
highest achieving students from all
corners of the globe”, offers attendees
a chance to participate in practical
sessions, lectures and seminars.
The scheme also offers careers
advice and guidance seminars on
UCAS applications, interview skills,
personal statement writing and
workshops on applying to medical
schools in the UK.
Attendees will also be put up in
halls near the South Kensington
campus, in twin rooms. They will also
be provided with meals three times a
week, and social activities will also be
included in the price.
Currently, there is no financial
aid available for anyone wishing to
attend this year, and all funds need to
be paid upfront all at once.
Felix has enquired if there will be a
subsidisation for students who may
struggle to raise the funds to attend
in the future, but at time of print has
not had a reply.
Places are awarded on a “first
come, first served” basis. Those
who wish to attend are required
to submit a personal statement, a
recommendation from a teacher or
tutor, and an up to date academic
transcript.
A booklet on the course available
from the Imperial website states: “Our
two week residential experience in the
heart of London will unite the highest
achieving students from all corners of
the globe for a rewarding insight into
all that Imperial has to offer.
“This is a unique opportunity for
anyone considering applying to
Imperial to experience life at the
College first hand.”
