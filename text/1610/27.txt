Kamil McClelland explores what inspires us to seek out adventure
"The

discovery:
masks,

trinkets
from all
around the
world."
“But there is no such thing as a Silk
Road!”
I
didn’t quite know how to react.
What did she mean? Had my
grand plans of an adventure
along the ancient Silk Road
this summer all been in vain, chasing
an imaginary past in the vast and
stifling wastelands of Turkestan?
I was giddy in anticipation of this
lunchtime celebration I had been
invited to. It all started three years
ago when, in preparation for medical
school, I decided to volunteer with
a charity that sought to bring the
elderly into the technological age
by introducing them to computers
and the basics of how to use them.
And completely by chance, I was
paired with the most remarkable
woman I had ever met; an 100-year
old archaeologist with a lightning
fast wit, we bonded over mint tea and
halwa, sharing our passion for travel,
history and culture with tales of her
work in Helmand and Baluchistan
in the late ‘40s. Photographs of rural
life - horse-drawn carts, minarets
and naan sellers - told a story of a
different world, one that I knew no
longer existed but one that I still
wanted to travel to. However, due to
ongoing instability in the region, I
knew this would not be possible in
the foreseeable future. But a desire
had been ignited within me to visit a
world completely distinct from my
own.
And so when with my close friends
I decided an adventure for our final
long summer was needed, straight
away this thought of a new experience
overcame my mind. “It’s got to be
Central Asia”, I argued. The ultimate
melting pot of the world, it sat at
the crossroads of history’s greatest
civilisations, absorbing influences
from all its borders - China, Russia,
the Middle East - like a cultural
sponge dripping with intrigue and
conflict. And although the reality of
the area nowadays is more defined
by its post-Soviet dictators, I knew it
would nevertheless be an expedition
to reinvigorate the soul.
Months of planning later and with
the support of Imperial’s Exploration
Board, I found myself at this party,
one to celebrate my archaeologist
friend’s 101st
at the home of an
academic colleague. An unassuming
facade on a quiet street in Clapham, I
could not have imagined the artistic
hoard that lay inside, the product
of a lifetime of excavations and
discoveries; masks, pottery, trinkets
from all around the world adorned
the walls, alive with all the dreams of
travel that glazed my eyes.
full of stories and helpful advice.
Notably, they spoke warmly of
one city in particular - Bukhara.
Though little known of in the West,
the descriptions painted for me of
this Silk Road city filled me with
wonderment. Emerging from the
unbroken desert, a single minaret
pierces upwards through the haze
as if a vision. In the eyes of a weary
traveller, this phenomenal tower
represents the end of a devastating
journey across sun-parched
nothingness.
Built in mediaeval times alongside
its more famous sister city of
Samarkand, Bukhara is a place of
fantasy. You could sit for days in the
shade of the central square, watching
as children jump from trees into
the tiled pond, trying to escape the
midday heat. From there, a short walk
to the city’s Old Town introduces you
to the narrow warrens of its ancient
Jewish Quarter, a community that
has been all but wiped out in this
staunchly muslim nation. Only one
synagogue remains.
I could not emerge from this
dream: bustling markets stacked high
with porcelain teapots, the desolate,
featureless Karakum (Black Sand)
Desert, specked with the bivalve
fossils of its aquatic past. However,
the reality of our undertaking was
never too far away - mid-summer,
over 2300 miles of cycling through
mostly desert. It was all too obvious as
I carefully studied a map of our route.
And so, although the reality of our
expedition may be far removed from
my dreams, perhaps as Mile 1000 of
unrelenting desert heat chips away at
my soul or when our water supplies
run low, hallucinations of plentiful
oasis towns, ethereal domed mosques,
will beckon me onwards, just as it
did the Bactrian caravans centuries
before me.

“What do you mean it doesn’t
exist?”, I questioned anxiously. The
original statement was in fact more
a clarification of the term ‘Silk
Road’ than an outright rejection
of its existence. For it was not
simply one road but a term coined
in the West for the mesh of trade
routes extending all the way from
the Middle East to central China.
As certain routes declined due to
warfare or even high taxes, others
boomed, a constant ebb and flow that
carried with it not only goods but
knowledge and religion. Moreover,
it is a misnomer that it was merely
a ‘Silk’ road or that commerce was
unidirectional. Teas and spices
and a panoply of other wares were
also traded, in both directions, for
centuries before improved maritime
trade routes brought about the route’s
demise.
My hosts, an archaeologist and an
art historian, had travelled to the
region many times and thus were
