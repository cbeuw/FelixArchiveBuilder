Cecile Borkhataria takes a look at the shoe exhibition at the V&A
Shoes: Pleasure and Pain
The V&A’s latest fashion
exhibition takes a look at the
extremes of footwear from
around the world, ranging from
Cinderella’s glass slippers featured
in the recent Disney live action
movie, to tiny lotus shoes used to
bind women’s feet in 19th
century
China. The exhibition focuses on
the transformative quality of shoes
and their cultural significance,
particularly as a symbol of status.
With over 200 shoes on display,
examples are shown from famous
shoe wearers as well as a vast range of
historical shoes dating as far back as
30 BCE.
Immediately after walking through
the entrance to the exhibition, the
dimly lit set-up accompanied with
provocative music instantly creates
a sensual atmosphere, alluding to
the seductive power of certain types
of shoes. On a projector, a woman is
shown tying on a pair of red heels
with ribbons, walking up a flight
of stairs and through a hallway in
a fitted dress. Here, the message
is clear: shoes equal sex. This isn’t
just my interpretation though; the
exhibition has an entire section
entitled Seduction. Footwear, together
with feet, have long been fetishised.
For women, the shoes most often
associated with seduction are, of
course, heels. The appeal of heels
are numerous. For one, they affect
the movement of a woman’s body
whilst walking, pushing out the chest
and behind whilst lengthening the
leg, all of which are titillating for
the opposite sex. ‘Stripper heels’ are
placed on display, and whilst these
may just look like normal heels to
many of us, with a long thin heel
and a platform, they were originally
created for a specific purpose.
Strippers originally wore these heels
to allow them to grip onto poles, with
the platforms providing a firmer
footing.
Another section of the exhibition
entitled Status gives an insight into
the social significance of shoes across
the world. For example, large rosettes
of gilded or silver lace, appropriately
named ‘shoe roses’ were used to
emphasise the nobleman’s legs in the
17th
century, who would have worn
tights to emphasise his calves. Shoes
that indicate a high social status are
often impractical in their shape and
design, making a clear statement that
the wearer does not have to walk in
their shoes from A to B, but rather
would be chauffeured or transported
on a horse drawn carriage, far away
from dirty, muddy streets. For
example, ‘Geta’ shoes were worn
by high-ranking Japanese geishas,
known as ‘Oiran’, during the feudal
era (1186-1600). These were sandals
with an elevated wooden base to keep
the feet dry in rain or snow. The taller
the shoe was, the higher the rank of
the geisha. The two supporting pieces
below the base board are also made
of wood and make a clacking sound
Shoes, glorious shoes. Photos: Victoria and Albert Museum
when the wearer walks, signalling the
presence of a high status geisha.
Some truly weird and wonderful
shoes are on display, all telling their
own story. A pair of 1938 black ankle
boots designed by Andre Perugia (the
Christian Louboutin of the time) is
draped with flowing Colobus monkey
fur, conveying the excesses of the
wealthy at the time. During World
War II though, the design of shoes
was dictated by a lack of material
and a sensibility about what was
appropriate. Such a pair of shoes is
exhibited, made by a shoemaker in
Kensington using the clients’ old
cheetah print coat.
A number of iconic shoes appear
throughout the exhibition, including
Sex and the City Carrie Bradshaw’s
Manolo Blahnik Mary Jane heels. For
those who are more inclined towards
sportswear, there’s even a display
of Brooklyn football boots worn
by David Beckham when he played
for Manchester United. For those
more interested in the construction
process, the upper floor showcases
methods of shoe creation and
innovative new ways of making shoes
using 3D printers.
The bottom line? There’s something
for everyone here.
