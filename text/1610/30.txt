This week you are Hangman.
Your horoscopes writer gives
you yet more unprintable
horoscopes. Despite knowing
full well that any attempt at
having standards will get you
fired, you accept your fate and
refuse to allow them in the
paper. The Editor is too drunk
to fire you, and you survive
another year.

This week you are a worker in
the Blue Cube. Concerned by
how close to home Blue News
is currently hitting, you begin
to suspect your colleagues
of leaking information to
Hangman. It could be anyone.
Trust no-one.
This week you too are
Hangman. Normally at this
point you’d make a pained
plea for people to contribute,
but you remember this is the
last issue of the year so you no
longer care.
You finish writing, and piss
off to the bar to get drunk for
three months straight.
This week in an attempt to
beat E.L James out of the gate,
you write an erotic novel, filled
with voluptuous sex scenes and
vivid penetration; however
your 50 shades of Chris Kaye
doesn’t do as well as you
planned and as a result you
lose the deposit you put down
on the book is lost and your
Brazilian girlfriend leaves you.
This week you resign from
your club due to the fact that
nobody wants you as President;
however as an attempt to
reintegrate yourself into the
cool squad by having sex in the
Felix office, it ends up going the
wrong way and you must go
into exile. You are not the chair
of RAG.
This week you are the
President of Imperial College.
You pick up a copy of Felix,
hoping to find out the latest
news about goings on in your
venerable institution.
Instead, you find Blue News.
You sue Felix for defamation.
This week you go to the RCSU
bar night, hoping to take
advantage of the free drinks
following the end of your
exams. Unfortunately, you
have one too many vodka-Red-
Bulls, and black out.
You wake up the next
morning in the Felix Editor’s
bed. No-one knows how you
got there or what happened.
This week you are the Felix
Editor. Enraged by the
constant defamation of your
good person in the horoscopes,
you go to the RCSU bar night
planning on drowning your
sorrows with the free drinks.
You get black-out drunk and
wake up the next morning
with a mystery man in your
bed. No regrets.
This week you accidentally
leave your Facebook logged in
in the Central Library. When
you return, you find that some
joker has added everyone on
Facebook with the same name
as you as a friend.
You spend the next three
months getting notifications
that [insert your name here]
has accepted your request.
This week you are the
horoscope writer; however you
just finished your exams so
you are horrendously drunk;
however the Felix Editor still
needs her horoscopes tho and
you wouldn’t let her down so
who even knows if these are
funny so good luck.
(Hangman accepts no
responsibility for grammar.)
This week you write a
complaint letter due to the
abhorrent language used in
the horoscopes- it appears
thats you have never read
horoscopes before: Fuck shit
cunt fanny piss twat bollocks
curmodgeon axe wound
wankathon.
Diary Of a Fresher, aged 19 1/4
Saturday 13th June
Well, diary, this is it. My exams are all over (the ones I went to, anyway), I don’t have any more coursework
or projects. Everything I was supposed to do academically is done.
I mean, I also fucked everything up, and I won’t know what happens with ‘mitigating circumstances’ for at
least another month. Guess I just have to wait for my results.
I don’t know if I really want to come back to Imperial, to be honest. It’s been a bit of a shit year.
There was all that crap with Dorothy (the human one), and with Dorothy (the goat one), as well as
whatever the hell happened with Kris Kraye in Turkmenistan.
I don’t really remember most of what happened. At times, I’m not sure I felt like the same person. It was as
if the story of my life kept changing on a whim.
If you ask me (I don’t know who “you” are, must be a rhetorical device I’ve started using), Imperial’s been a
pile of crap.
I didn’t know anyone when I came here, I won’t know anyone when I leave, and everything else inbetween
has just been absolutely insane.
I’m going home tomorrow, I probably won’t bother keeping up this diary after that.
So long, Imperial. I won’t miss you.

News in Brief: Hangman allegedly considering bid to be
FIFA President What is going on inside
the Blue Cube this week
With the last Blue News upon us, we had
some tough decisions to make over what
to include - we have a whole summer of
events to list, and just this one magnificent
column to fit them all into!
All-Staff Briefing Cancelled
This week’s All-Staff Briefing has sadly been
cancelled by the Vice Provost (Arbitrary
Excuses) as he was too busy writing his
Provost Post of the Week to send out the
agenda in time.
What Is: Blue News?
This week, we’re making use of our ‘What
Is’ session to clear up a regular source of
confusion: the provenance and purpose of
Blue News.
We’re also taking the chance to celebrate
the people behind Blue News - you know
us, never ones to miss an opportunity to
multi-task!
Pop along to the Boardroom from 1pm on
Tuesday for the run-down on Blue News,
before we’ll get things going from 2pm with
our celebratory bash!
Prosecco will be provided, as well as green
tea for all you ‘tea-totallers’ out there!
Staff Awards Ceremony
In a first for the Faculty Building, we’ll be
holding a very special awards ceremony,
where we give those special members of
staff who have greatly contributed to life at
Imperial.
If you feel a member of staff has done
something particularly wonderful, please
do consider nominating them for an award.
Simply send an email over to us at
FacultyAwards@imperial.ac.uk, with
your nomination and why you think they
deserve to be rewarded!
We’ll be holding the ceremony at 4pm on
Wednesday, and we look forward to seeing
you all there!
Don’t forget to bring your yoga mat as
usual, and green tea will (of course) be
provided.
What is going on outside the
Blue Cube this week
Something something something ban
on leaving the building without written
permission something something.
Alice Gast: Thought of the Week
“This week, I’ve been collaborating with the
senior management team to put the final
touches to our official renaming of the White City
Campus, and I’m extremely pleased to finally
be able to update everyone on this intelligent
and forward-thinking decision by the team. I’m
sure we can can all agree that this is the perfect
name for the campus. Anyone who disagrees
can, quite frankly, piss off.”
The weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building
Blue News
Provost Post
of the Week
Every week, a member of
our esteemed Provost board
shares their thoughts with
our collaborative, cohesive
community. This week, we
welcome back Al Pologies,
Vice Provost (Arbitrary
Excuses)!
Hi all,
I’m so glad to finally be
writing this column - after all
those unfortunate, unexpected
mishaps kept me away from the
keyboard, I thought I was in real
danger of never appearing in
Blue News!
What a travesty that would
have been!
Of course, as we all know, no
truly self-respecting member
of staff could allow themselves
to pass up the opportunity
to appear on these hallowed
pages.
Naturally, I consider myself
pretty self-respecting, so doing
everything in my power to get
this post written up and sent in
in time was an absolute given!
I have to say, it feels fantastic
to finally know that these words
I’m typing now will make their
way into print, appearing in
every copy of Blue News that
finds its way into the hands of
all you magnificent workers of
the Faculty Building.
I’m getting shivers of joy just
thinking about it.
Unfortunately, I’ve just
discovered that I may not be
able to finish this post - my
assistant has just stuck their
head ‘round the door to let me
know that an urgent matter
requiring my attention has just
flared up.
It’s a hard life being the Vice
Provost (Arbitrary Excuses) -
something always seems to
happen that means you’re
needed elsewhere.
It’s tough going, and requires
a lot of work to keep up - there’s
only so many arbitrary excuses
people can take before their
patience can understandably
wear thin, and it’s my job to
make sure all of you in the
Faculty Building can work and
collaborate as best you can,
without feeling obstructed by
the unfortunate necessity of
arbitrary excuses.
Hope to see you around!
Hello all,
This is it, wonderful gentlemen (and ladies) of the Faculty Building!
The last Blue News of the academic year, as we allow the lovely boys
in Comms to take a well-deserved holiday until October so that they
can recuperate and recover from the high stress job of putting this
magnificent newsletter together.
But before that, we have a very big announcement!
I’m sure all of you remember the excitement surrounding the big reveal
of our Imperial West campus (and, of course, its sister campus of
Imperial Very West). I’m now delighted to reveal the official name of both
sites: Imperial West will become the White City Campus, while Imperial
Very West is now confirmed as the Heathrow Campus.
Both of these sites are steeped in history - White City takes its name from
the white marble covering the exhibition pavillions that once sat there
during the 1909 Imperial International Exhibition (note how Imperial was
already a global, world-leading institution, even at the very beginning!).
Heathrow, meanwhile, takes its name from the famous airport in the
local area - another example of our enormous international links with
the global community!
But to counter that good news, we must also say ‘vale’ (that’s “goodbye”,
to all you well-educated-but-not-Latin-educated folks!) to some of our
wonderful staff.
Among them are the Vice Provosts for Student Voice (following the
results of the informal review into his position), Halls Demolition (as our
current plans for demolition have now all been carried out) and Kettling
(as this service as now been outsourced to the Metropolitan Police).
We are also looking for new Vice Provosts for Halls Construction and
Campus Naming Services - but more on that one another time!
Have a productive, cohesive, collaborative and happy day!
