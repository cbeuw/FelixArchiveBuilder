James Bezer looks back on a year of science in Felix
Comets, dinosaurs and drugs.
Lots of drugs
Flicking through all the editions
of Felix we’ve printed this year,
I’ve been struck by several
things about the science section.
The first is Lauren’s slightly
worrying obsession with articles
about LSD, at least one of which
seemed to appear every almost week.
The second was every slightest typo,
mistake and generally awkwardly
phrased sentence that seemed to
glare out from every article I wrote
or edited.
The third however, was the huge
variety of interesting articles
that have been sent to us, ranging
from new advances in solar power
and energy storage, all the way to
fundamental discoveries about
measuring distances between
galaxies. Thank you so much to all the
writers who’ve sent so many different
things in to us, and I hope that many
of you continue to do so next year.
I’m never quite sure how many
people usually reach this section
of the newspaper, so, as a recap for
those of you who haven’t been paying
attention for the last 28 issues, I’ve
come up with a selection of some of
the most memorable stories we’ve
covered this year.
Rosetta’s comet rendezvous
One of the biggest stories this
year was the rendezvous of the
Rosetta orbiter with comet 67P/
Churyumov–Gerasimenko that
took place in November. The Philae
lander touched down successfully,
giving detailed information about the
surface and chemical composition of
a comet for the very first time.
Imperial’s involvement was led by
Chris Carr, Principal Investigator
on the orbiter’s magnetometer. In
an interview with Felix, he explained
the difficulties involved in running
the project, and some unexpected
magnetic field behaviour his team
had observed.
This was just the start of the
mission for Rosetta, however, which
is designed to stay with the comet as
it approaches the Sun, and analyse the
gas and dust that comes off it. And
with the recent announcement that
Philae was now operational again,
there remains huge potential for new
discoveries in the near future.
Ebola vaccine researched
At the start of the year, we covered
research at Imperial into a vaccine
for ebola. At the time, the outbreak
growing rapidly with nearly 6000
cases already reported.
The team recruited 40 volunteers in
the Gambia to test the efficacy of the
vaccine produced by GSK. The trials
are still continuing with much larger
numbers of participants.
Although the number of new cases
has declined significantly in recent
months, the outbreak is still going on,
and has so far reached a total of over
27,000 cases.
Ecstasy and LSD could be used in
medicine
Research into the effect of LSD
and ecstasy (MDMA) on the brain
has shown that hallucinogenic drugs
could be used to treat psyciatric
illnesses like depression and PTSD.
In October, Imperial’s David Nutt
and Robin Carhart-Harris carried out
the first new trials of LSD on humans
for over 40 years, to test its effect on
suggestibility.
Nutt’s group has also started
research on a new drug Chaperon,
which is similar to ecstasy and could
be seen in future as a way to stop
binge drinking.
Warm oceans under Enceladus
10 years since Cassini arrived at
Saturn, the probe is still capable of
making major discoveries.
In March, while flying by Saturn’s
moon Enceladus, results from its
mass spectrometer provided us
with the first clear evidence that
hydrothermal activity is occuring
outside our planet.
Dust particles made of silica
were found ranging from 2 to 9
nanometres, indicating they were
made by a specific process that was
only previously known to occur in
certain regions of the Earth’s oceans.
The discovery suggests that warm
oceans exist under the surface
of Enceladus, which add to the
possibility of finding environments
capable of sustaining life.
‘Three-person babies’ allowed
A vote in parliament in February
permitted the creation of babies
treated with mitochondrial
replacement therapy for the first
time.

"Warm
oceans were
discovered
on
Enceladus,
which
could be
able to
harbour
life."
"David
Nutt
carried out
the first
new trials
of LSD on
humans
for over 40
years."
The technique involves replacing
faulty mitochondria in a fertilised
egg with those of a healthy donor.
When it is allowed to develop into
a baby, all its cells carry copies of
the donor’s mitochondria. It is for
this reason that the process has been
labelled as creating ‘three-person
babies’
Professor of science and society
Robert Winston was instrumental
in getting the bill through the House
of Lords, making an impassioned
speech that drew on his experience in
fertility treatments.
While the vote opens the gate for
the technique, further research is
needed, and it’s not expected that the
first babies will be born for several
years.
Having trouble sleeping?
In November, we reported on
new research into how the body
controls when you wake up and
fall asleep. The researchers, from
Imperial and Cambridge, deleted a
well-known ‘clock’ gene from mice,
and discovered that this led to higher
brain histamine levels during the day.
As a result, the mice had shallower
and more fragmented sleep patterns.
Sleep research in recent years has
shown it fulfils a variety of important
functions, including restoration and
recovery, metabolic replenishment of
the brain and helping to consolidate
memories.
