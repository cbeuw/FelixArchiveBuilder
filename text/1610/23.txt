The National wants you to watch
Following on from Beyond Caring
in the National’s Temporary
Theatre, We Want You to Watch
is the latest venture from producing
trio RashDash, written together with
Alice Birch.
Very little is available about the
show – the synopsis is a collection of
short, abrupt sentences that let you
know “this is about pornography.”
And that it’s against pornography.
That too.
The set doesn’t give many clues
either. This is starting to feel like a
theme for plays around this time –
not much information beforehand,
and a set which gives nothing away.
Designer Oliver Townsend has
created a scaffolding monstrosity that
sits on one wall of the theatre.
Two ladders are strapped to the
sides, with a platform sitting at the
height of the balcony. Covering it all:
what look like soup cans, with the
word ‘soup’ replaced by ‘sex’.
This is not a subtle visual metaphor.
The entrance is covered with a
picture of an open mouth, blown up
to ridiculous proportions.
This is initially the focal point of
most of the audience’s attentions,
with an odd hush descending every
time the flaps twitch a little.
Eventually, a harsh rumbling fills
the room, the sound of subwoofers
being pushed to their limits, and the
lights start to flicker.
It’s starting to sound like the
building is crashing down around our
ears, and the lights suddenly snap off.
A nicely dramatic opening.
Unfortunately, We Want You to
Watch very quickly squanders this
dramatic potential.
It opens on an interrogation, two
detectives quizzing a milkman with a
fondness for violent porn.
No explanation is given, the
audience are expected to piece the
scene together on the fly.
It soon becomes clear that the
detectives believe the man’s porn
addictions lead to his murdering a
young dental student, using methods
identical to those in the videos he
can’t stop watching.
It’s all a bit weird, but at least the
message is fairly clear. This can’t
be said for much of the following
theatre.
The first scene soon begins to
outstay its welcome, with the
attempts at comedy mostly falling
flat.
Most of the humour comes from
the absurd lines, with the rest being
supplied by the synchronicity of the
detectives’ movements. Helen Goalen
and Abbi Greenland (the artistic
directors of RashDash, and the stars
here) have clearly rehearsed this to
perfection, which is to their credit if
nothing else.
The earnestness of their
performance, their commitment to
this production, is incredible, but
it just can’t support a script which
quickly overplays its hand, and fails

But Jack Steadman suggests otherwise (this time, anyway)
A Rousing Tale of Football and Loyalty
To start with, just to avoid
confusion – The Red Lion is in
and of itself not a humorous
play. Certain scenes were found
particularly funny by the audience
– perhaps partly because laughing
prevents them from thinking too
deeply about the situation, and partly
because those scenes were meant to be
funny; but the play itself has a deadly
serious message.
The scenery of the changing room
of ‘The Red Lion’, the local football
club, is both familiar and arcane,
and was a brilliant choice to convey
the dramatic mood of the play itself.
From the dirty club flag, the worn-
down bench, and the hospital-like
massage bed in the middle, to the
sounds of the dripping tap in the
bathroom, everything found on the
stage added something of value to the
experience.
The Red Lion can be viewed in a
number of ways: you can just watch
it and enjoy it; you can watch it, then
think about it and still like it; or
you can watch it, apply its message
to everything surrounding you in
this world, and love it. No matter
which method you choose, I still
recommend this play. Not because
it is funny, not because it is about
football, but simply because it has so
much to say.
The Sunday league. Your local team.
Your friends there, or you enemies,
who took your position and because
of whom you started sitting on the
bench. These things mean something
to a lot of people. One doesn’t need
to be a Harvard researcher to claim
that a large number of men had a
part in their life when they dreamed
of being a football star (or perhaps
still dream of this); many of them
have played FIFA Manager Mode as
well, where – despite the title – they
probably did not realize what it really
takes to be a manager. But it is never
too late – come along and watch it
yourself what you need: you do not
start off a club that would be able
to win the Champion’s League next
year; the board does not pay you the
stratospheric salary reported about
in the media; you need to develop,
because you do not always want to
be at the League 3; and probably you
actually need to make a living. But
we also have the other side of the
coin: the side of the ‘old soul’ kitman
(Peter Wight), who claims his support
for The Red Lions, and for the game
itself; he claims it proudly, unlike the
manager; and he claims it constantly,
unlike the so-called ‘fans’ and the
board who only realize they have a
club when it tops the league.
In the middle of this contrast, a
potential star (Calvin Demba) rises
out of nowhere to become man of
the match. The manager (Daniel
Mays) talks about loyalty, but wants
to sell him to make some money for
the club, and himself; the ‘old soul’
does not talk about loyalty but want
him to be loyal, both to himself and
to the club. Meanwhile the kid just
wants to play the game, but does he
Company SJ: Samuel Beckett in the City
Jingjie Cheng finds that the writer’s work is still powerful to this day
Sometimes, a creative piece comes
along that leaves you thinking
about its issues for a long time,
surfacing now and then as a question,
emerging here and there as an idea.
These works leave an imprint of the
artist’s thoughts on you, and you are
left with a view of the world through
another’s eyes. Sometimes, the full
brilliance of these ideas does not take
you over until you have turned the
words over again and again, passed
them between your hands, rubbed
them between your fingers. They do
what effective art is meant to do –
make you ponder.
Samuel Beckett’s Rough for Theatre
I and Act Without Words II are two
such works that left me mulling over
the issues presented long after the
short sketches ended. The double bill,
part of the ongoing International
Beckett Season at the Barbican
Centre, juxtaposes two of the Irish
playwright’s miscellaneous sketches
and runs a common theme through
them. Who are the destitute? What
are their stories? And what can they
tell us about the nature of human
relationships?
Indeed, the interaction between two
homeless people in Rough for Theatre
I can almost be seen as a microcosm
of human relationships – A and B
have apparently been left behind in a
miserable place, devoid of any other
human being. A is blind while B is
crippled, and each can theoretically
rely on the other to supply what
they lack. However, as in many such
transactions, there is a mismatch
between what one expects and what
the other is willing to give, leading
to conflict and manipulation. Throw
into the mix two very different
personalities, and the audience
can see how many ways this ideal
collaboration can go wrong.
A, having once seen the light,
is eager for B to describe to him
everything about the surroundings,
often asking if there was light, or
whether it was day. B, who can
see how hopeless the situation is
around them, is more cynical, and
gets increasingly irritated by A’s
repeated requests for him to describe.
He does not believe that A will help
him “unconditionally”, but A does,
and the two men share an intimate
moment together, two forsaken souls
with only each other for company.
The production is part of Beckett
in the City, a project by the Dublin-
based group Company SJ, which
specializes in the works of W. B. Yeats
and Beckett. The project, which began
in 2009, transposes the absurdist
master’s works into the architectural
and social spaces of the city. It has
already presented this double bill as
site-specific pieces in Ireland, USA,
and Japan. In each production, the
characters’ relationship with their
surroundings is different, but the
issues are the same.
When the audience arrives for
this Barbican production, they are
led off to an undisclosed location
in the Barbican Estate, and it is this
act of navigation that begins the
journey. By travelling to find the
left-behind characters of Rough, we
are reminded of their isolation. The
actual city landscape that the play is
set in, then, becomes part of the play’s
identity, and conversely, the scene
also irrevocably changes the way we
view our city.
Indeed, the beauty of these sketches
is their versatility in raising different
issues, depending on where and
how it is portrayed. By staging it in
various street corners, Company
SJ’s director Sarah Jane Scaife draws
parallels between these men and the
homeless in big cities, in the process
drawing us closer to their plight.
At the same time, by performing
Act Without Words II after Rough,
she sets Act in the context of the
homeless. Act is by itself primarily
an absurdist work, a comment on the
essential meaninglessness of life as
two characters are goaded into action
in turn by, well, a goad. They crawl
out of their bags in turn, going about
their daily tasks which highlight their
different personalities – A is messy
and frail, while B is self-conscious,
obsessive, and disciplined. At some
point in their routine, they carry
the bag containing the other person
one step away from the goad, but the
goad still reaches them in the next
round and they repeat the routine –
an action somewhat reminiscent of
Sisyphus’ task in Hades.
In this case, Scaife is perhaps using
Act to point out the vicious cycle that
many homeless folk are trapped in.
By putting A and B in bags that look
like the sleeping bags of the homeless,
she is perhaps commenting on those

that have fallen through society’s
cracks, and how difficult it is to step
out of the routines that have defined
their lives. In this way, while Act was
initially rather incomprehensible, the
myriad of interpretations and issues
that it raises emerges the more one
mulls over it.
It does, however, take some
patience to sit through Act, especially
if one is unfamiliar with the idea.
Being a mime piece and beginning
rather slowly, it can be quite
exasperating if one does not know
what the point is. Despite that,
Raymond Keane does a very good job
in portraying a tremor-riddled A and
Bryan Burroughs manages to fully
embody B’s obsessiveness without
appearing affected. Keane is also B
in Rough, while Trevor Knight was a
convincingly sentimental A.
Rough for Theatre I/Act Without
Words II is definitely a unique
theatrical experience, and one that
has important messages for our
society today.
Rough for Theatre I and Act Without
Words II are on as a double bill until the

have something to hide? Why did
he choose the small-town Red Lions,
when he is too good for them?
The ‘old soul’, a former player
himself, talks about the good old
days, when he kicked a goal in the
last minute in front of his wife, who
was sitting on the sidelines. When
his career ceased, his life ceased too.
The manager, meanwhile, mentions
his family when asked, but that is
it. Nothing else exists in their heart
other than football; and nothing else
exists on the stage other than football.
But it’s not the glimmering, shiny,
and lustrous game we see on the TV.
The Red Lion is a phenomenon. It is
a powerful play based on a true story.
And not on one, but on many.
The Red Lion is on at the National
Theatre until 30th
September.
to accurately express the message it’s
aiming for.
This becomes more and more of the
problem as the show progresses.
There is no real through narrative
beyond Goalen and Greenland’s
characters wanting to stop the
existence of violent porn and its toxic
effects by any means necessary.
This is a vital message, an urgent
message, one that needs to be heard,
but it’s not one that comes through
here.
The show ends up being a blast of
frenetic, hyperkinetic energy that
(almost) thrills, while also managing
to be a confused, meandering mess
of a show that knows what it wants to
do but hasn’t quite worked out how
to do it.
The flashes of genuinely funny
comedy immediately shoot
themselves in the foot by going on
too long, and the serious points are
lost beneath the absurd scenarios that
take place.
We Want You to Watch is, above
all else, a crushing disappointment.
There are some clearly very talented
individuals working on this show.
There’s a painfully important
message at the heart of it.
It’s just all a bit underwhelming.
Beyond Caring knew what it wanted
to achieve and how to get there, and
took no prisoners in the process. We
Want You to Watch feels like it got lost
somewhere along the way.
We Want You to Watch is at the
National Theatre until 11th
July. Tickets
from £15, available online.
