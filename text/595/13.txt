W e were fortunate to he hosts to Technico
Lisbon, the champion club of Portugal last
season. W e were afforded this opportunity
thanks to our Portuguese scrum half Jose
Paixao.
T h e m a t c h was p l a y e d i n a h i g h l y
competitive spirit, this was shown by the
number of injuries sullered on both sides.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y o u r h o o k e r was t a k e n to
hospital live minutes into the match, and
along with our two U L players missing, the
team was slightly below strength.
Suffering from this disorganisation we
conceded all 25 points before hall-time, but
rallied splendidly to come back strongly.
In the bar we entertained our guests with a
few songs, but unfortunately they didn't
share our taste for English beer. W'e were
presented with a shield from their club,
engraved with the date and our club name.
W e look forward to seeing them again in
Portugal at Easter.

Seconds
Vet again the Seconds had to travel by B R to
reach their opponents ground. This time it
was Thames Poly at W'ell H a l l .
E v e n t h o u g h I C w e r e u n d e r h e a v y
pressure in the lirst ten minutes ol the game,
we w e r e the first to s c o r e , t h r o u g h a
dropped goal by J . Symes.
E v e n though, for the first time this season
we had a proper referee, it didn't seem to
make much difference apart from the amount
of times we were penalised in the line-outs.
As in all of the matches this season the
defence was very good. Credit must go to the
centres and the back row, who were always
there when they were needed.
T h e linal score was 26-0, thought it should
really have been more.
T h e points were scored by: J . Davies (IT),
A . R a l p h (2T), M . Winsor (l pen), J . Symes
( 1 T 1 D G ) .

Volleyball
I C Volleyball C l u b played their first match
last Wednesday against Tottenham College.
T h e Tottenham team, who arrived an hour
late, must have regretted turning up at all as
I C took the first set 15-3. Imperial looked far
superior to their opponents and the second
set followed almost as quickly, the score being
15-8. Tottenham managed to raise their
game at the start of the third set however,
and some sloppy play by Imperial allowed
them to take a 7-1 lead. After a time out,
called by Captain-on-Court P. Rouge, I C
b a c k e d themselves up a n d after a great
lightback narrowly lost the set 15-12. In the
fourth set I C reasserted themselves to w i n 15-
8 and so finished three sets to one winners.
Thanks to L e c h lor refereeing and Silvana
for scoring/supporting.

Tasso A s t e r a i d e s took the L ' L r u n n i n g
scene by storm last Wednesday, by winning
the first L o n d o n Colleges League race of the
season, at Parliament H i l l . H e completed the
muddy five and a half mile course in a
s t a g g e r i n g t w e n t y - s e v e n m i n u t e s i i l t e e n
seconds to win easily by forty to fifty yards.
Perhaps even more important is the fact
that we had a magnificent turn out of sixteen
runners including, for the first time, a ladies
team. These people make the team just as
much as the winner and just as in previous
years, with the wins of Steve K i r k and E v a n
Cameron, this result will surely improve the
overall standard of the club.
Other creditable performances came from
A n d y Britton in the mens race (34th) and
Sarah Pearson in the ladies (ripping the field
apart to come 17th). A special thanks also to
Nicola who, despite cycling all over London
first, came a creditable 31st.
T h e ladies have had a very encouraging
start to the season, w i n n i n g b o t h t h e i r
matches against Q E C (A) and L S E (H), 7-2
and 6-3 respectively. Thanks to all who
played: Barbara. Lesley, Andrec. K a r e n .
J a n . Alison and Fiona.
The E G M will be held in the (heat H a l l on
M o n d a y , November 9 at 7:30pm. O n the
agenda will be election for H o n Treasurer.
Papers are up on the club noticcboard for this
position. Please make a special effort to turn
up.
Consistent team performances have led lo
defeats of Barts I. K i n g s II and L S E II and
have placed Mens III at the top of the U L
Badminton League Division III.

Firsts
This match can be summed up in one word:
"disappointing ". H a v i n g struggled hard lo
keep scores level at 3-3 at half-time we kept
up pressure into the second half only to let a
stupid run-away try leave us trailing 9-3 and
eventually losing 12-3.
However with the great amount of effort
put in and some thoughtful rugby being
played I a m confident of a positive result in
our Gutteridge C u p clash against R o y a l
Holloway on Wednesday. November 4.
