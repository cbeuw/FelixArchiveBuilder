Very little to say this week except that I'm
beginning to find a lot of the contents of FELIX
quite tedious. Is it boredom or merely me
feeling absolutely knackered at the end of
another sixty hour week? Either way, a few
warnings.
Firstly, don't bring in any old crap, scribbled
half legibly on a piece of bog paper and expect
me to clasp my tiny hands together and thank
you. I won't. It will be thrown in the bin
whether it is before the copy deadline or not.
Secondly, how about some more interesting
letters? Forget about Tony Benn and Frank
James and concentrate on some topics closer
to home. Isn't there anything around College
that really gets your goat?
Thirdly, to include all sports reports and
"clubs and society" articles they must be no
longer than two hundred words—shorter if
possible. I will discard the largest articles
first—hence I'll disappoint fewer people.
A n d finally nobody has a right to expect to
h a v e a n y t h i n g t h e y b r i n g in i n c l u d e d
necessarily. If it is crap it will be dumped.
Anything I find more interesting and amusing
will take priority.
End of meglo bit. Gripe, wince, gripe.
25th L o n d o n F i l m Festival
I wouldn't like to wager how many of you
c u l t u r e l e s s slobs have d e c i d e d to take
advantage of the 25th London Film Festival.
This started on Tuesday and continues to
November 22. There are over one hundred
and twenty-five films from forty-nine countries,
with up to six screenings daily. Some tickets
are still available so hurry along to the box
office now.
Rag W e e k
Just as you've all settled in and are getting
down to work, what pops up? Rag Week is
traditional good sport, so why not go along to a
few events even if you're up to your ears in
work.
I must make an appeal on behalf of the Rag
Chairman (whose article I had to unfortunately
drop).
There is an Inter-Hall Rag Collection on
Saturday, "November 14, but our dear Rag
Chairman, William Durodie still needs to see a
representative from each Hall and House to
organise distribution and collection of cans.
Contact him via IC Union Office. (People not
in Hall can collect and return cans to IC Union
Office on the day.)

I went round to visit Weatherspoon the other
day. He's getting rather old now, and finds it
difficult to get out and visit his friends, and the
best way for him to keep in touch with them is
by telephone. At least it would be if only he
could remember his number.
'I know it has five digits,' he told me, 'but I
can never be quite certain what they are. Let
me see, is it
12451 ?
or 21853 ?
or 34133 ?
or 44901 ?
or 51865 ?
or 69635 ?
or 77984 ?
or 82601 ?
or 97120 ?
or 07980 ?
'Well would you believe it, I really have no
idea which is right.'
The obvious thing seemed to be a quick look
in the directory which revealed that each
number that Weatherspoon had given me had
just one digit correctly placed.
What is his number?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office, please. The usual prize of £5
(donated by Mend a Bike) to the correct
solution randomly selected next Wednesday
at 1:00pm.
Last Week's Solution
Fourteen missiles are sufficient, as shown in
the diagram. Of the four entries, that of Chris
Brannick, Maths 1, was chosen for this week's
prize. S h o w i n g that fourteen missiles are
sufficient is averagely difficult; proving that
fourteen are also necessary (i.e. that thirteen
are not enough) is much trickier. I leave this as
an exercise for the reader.
That Code...
...which seems to have caused more sleepless
nights than anything I've ever set. Most people
realised that, since the proportion of vowels to
consonants was about the same as in normal
English text, solving the code is (simply) a
matter of rearranging the letters into the
correct sequence. The obvious way to do this
is to write them out in the horizontal rows of a
rectangle, and then to read down the columns.
Whether you take a 19x9 rectangle, a 57x3,
3x57 or whatever, this method does not work.
Now mathematicians should have spotted
that 171 (the number of letters in the message)
is a triangle number i.e. the letters can (and, of
course must) be arranged in a triangle. Not all
of you are mathematicians, however, so I gave
you a subtle hint which caused as m u c h
confusion as the rest of the puzzle. Still, the
key is there, quite plainly: try rewriting it all
normally. G o o d luck everyone!
Two people solved it. Congratulations to
Gary Meyer, Math 3, who won, and com-
miserations to N . A . P r o b y n , who d'dn't.
Finally, as a bonus puzzle for masochists,
can you identify the source from which the de-
coded paragraph was taken? Answer next week.
