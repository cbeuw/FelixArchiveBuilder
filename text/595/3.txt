What
a riot!
M r Jonathan Rosenh'cad, from
the B r i t i s h Society l o r S o c i a l
Responsibility in Science, dis-
cussed the technology o f riot
control with the Socialist Society
on Tuesday.
Initially, M r Rosenhead talked
about riots in Ulster, especially
the use of rubber bullets by the
security forces. A specimen at the
meeting was "as hard as a cricket
b a l l " . '
However, as time progressed,
he claimed that its effectiveness
decreased as protesters knew when
it would be used. This fact. M r
R o s e n h e a d said, a l l o w e d the
A r m y to introduce plastic bullets,
allegedly causing seven deaths so
far this year. Condemning plastic
bullets he humorously quoted
one expert as saying " t h e ideal
weapon would be marshmallows
delivered by parachute".
M r Rosenhead saw the govern-
ment as gradually eroding civil
liberties. H e argued that it was
essential for the security forces to
be seen to be g o v e r n i n g b y
consent. T h e reality, he said, was
either that militants alone were
wounded or that random injuries
were inflicted on a crowd. T h e
two hundred policemen of the
Special Patrol Group, for exam-
ple, were seen by the speaker as a
riot squad in a l l but name.

tough skinned, but juicy.
Good start
for Cypriot
Soc
Following a passionate appeal in
last week's F ' E L I X for 'Cypriots
to unite' a meeting took place in
the S o u t h s i d e R e fee t o r y o n
Tuesday, November 2, toorganise
a society.
Although between twenty and
thirty signatures were received,
denoting these people's support
l o r t h e f o r m a t i o n o l s u c h a
society. About fifteen turned up
for their inaugural meeting.
The occasion was somewhat
i n f o r m a l , inlaet matters were
discussed over lunch. Although
they had not, as yet, formed a
committee, it became very clear
thai there was no lack of leader-
s h i p p o t e n t i a l amongst t h e m .
F o l l o w i n g i n the t r a d i t i o n o f
Mediterannean emotionalism a
v e r y a c t i v e a n d e n t h u s i a s t i c
discussion took place in which all
p a r t i c i p a t e d . O f the subjects
discussed was firstly the need for
a Cypriot society. They believed
t h a t a l t h o u g h t h e H e l l e n i c
Society was very good it d i d not
eater for the special needs ol
Cypriots with Armenian, Turkish,
or English origins, and it is for
these people that the society is
primarily directed. T h e forma-
tion of a constitution was also
given considerable debate a n d
this debate was to be continued
at their first general meeting.
Alter having observed them for
about one hour one can only
c o n c l u d e that they a r e v e r y
enthusiastic about forming their
society and indeed from the issues
discussed they have a great deal
to oiler to the cultural life of the
College, given a chance! A n d
considering the somewhat muted
activities of certain other societies
one can only oiler them whole-
hearted support a n d encourage-
ment in their sincere desires to
form a useful and active society.
STOIC ask
Aspel
M i c h a e l Aspel, the T V and radio
presenter, was interviewed by
S T O I C on Wednesday. D u r i n g
the twenty-minute interview he
talked of his career from leaving
school a n d b e c o m i n g a p u b -
lisher's tea-boy to the present
where he is a media 'commodity'.
The interview was the first to
be recorded bv S T O I C since the
1 9 7 9 / 8 0 session, a n d w i l l be
transmitted in about three weeks'
time. M i c h a e l R o d d {Tomorrow's
World), a n d A n d r e w Gardiner
( f o r m e r l y I T V ) w i l l also be
interviewed by S T O I C this vear.
Laithwaite in spin again
In the case of the Establishment vs Professor Eric Laithwaite the
professor seems to be w i n n i n g hands d o w n , on the evidence of
Tuesday's lecture to the Astrosoc. H e kept a large audience enthralled
as he, in his o w n words " P u t disturbing thoughts into their heads".
The lecture, more properly a demonstration, as lectures imply
theory, which he regards as a necessary evil, was titled 'Gravity, Mass
and Inertia', and centred around the so-far unexplained properties, an
impressive array of which he bad brought with h i m .
Being Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering, he naturally
compared these effects with his most famous brainchild, the linear
induction motor. T h e results rendered a n audience of scientists
speechlessâ€”not the least of his achievements.
Professor Laithwaite's approach was informed, clear and frequently
humorous. H e cheerfully destroyed fundamental concepts with sujch
statements as "'The Vector product is only a highly suspect aide-
memoire." and in proving this he showed that his distrust of theory
does not stem from any lack of ability in that direction on his part. H e
considers himself to be following in the footsteps of Faraday, whom he
sees as the greatest scientist of all time, dismissing Einstein as " A crazy,
mixed-up kid, who will be lucky if his name appears in a single physics
book a hundred years from n o w " .
Such statements do not seem so heretical when the laws of classical
mechanics have just been found wanting before your eyes. However,
his attitude that "the right answer never justifies incorrect means" has
d r a w n criticism form some quarters ever since his controversial
Christmas lectures, alter which the press claimed " L a i t h w a i t e says
Newton was wrong". H e denies this; it is merely that Newton's laws of
themselves do not explain such effects as apparent loss of weight and
energy in flywheels.
It is said that a scientist is a m a n who can predict experimental
results lrom established formulas, while a genius observes experimental
behaviour a n d then derives the theory. C e r t a i n l y , N e w t o n a n d
Faraday both worked on that principle, and Professor Laithwaite
seems to be firmly on the same track.
EXEC VIEWS
Does anybody read this waffle? If so please take note of a small
misconception some of you are under. I discovered this when compiling
the results of the refectory questionnaire (more of that when I have all the
data). Union income does no t subsidise refectories and never has.
Furthermore, any subsidy which did exist is being removed over the next
couple of years as U G C (ultimately Treasury) money is taken out of
refectories. This will not only happen here but in all universities and even
at the Royal College of Art which many of you seem to use (with good
reason). Just one more reason for a campaign against education cuts.
O n the subject of the R C A , the Deputy President of their student
union has written to me about the use of their refectory. IC students are
welcome, but not before 1:00pm at lunchtime as their own students must
use it between 12:00 and 1:00pm due to their timetables. They do offer a
bar and a coffee bar (with real coffee at 12p and a selection of teas) for
use between 12:30 and 1:00pm.
Please follow their request, we do not want to lose use of their
refectory altogether.
