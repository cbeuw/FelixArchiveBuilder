CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
H o l i d a y s in A m e r i c a have b e c o m e quite
popular over the last few years but did you
know you could work there as well to help pay
for it all?
Work permits aren't easy to get but the
British Universities North America Club can
get one for you.
B U N A C is a non-profit making organisation
run for students by students which operates
an exchange program enabling students at
B r i t i s h u n i v e r s i t i e s ( i n c l u d i n g o v e r s e a s
students) to work in the U S A and Canada for
the summer. W e arrange your work permit,
f l i g h t , i n s u r a n c e , a n d first n i g h t h o t e l
accommodation in America and also have an
office in New York to give you any help you
might need during your stay in the States.
Y o u have lots of choice in the type of work
you do. Y o u could work as a counsellor on a
k i d s ' s u m m e r c u p ( B U N A C A M P ) w o r k
"behind the scenes" in the camp kitchens
( K A M P ) , pick tobacco in Ontario or find your
own job anywhere you like. (We can help you
with our o w n job directories full of jobs
recommended by previous ' B U N A C E R S ' ) .
After you've finished work you can use your
savings to explore the vast North American
continent. So make the most of the long
summer holidays you'll never have again. It's
the chance of a lifetime.
C o m e and find out more at one of our
weekly meetings every Friday lunchtime in the
Green Committee Room on the top floor of
the Union Building.
There will be a slideshow about holidaying in
the U S A followed by wine and cheese on
Wednesday, November 11 at 7:30pm, Room
3 C , U L U , Malet St, W C 1 (Goodge St. tube).
Free to B U N A C m e m b e r s , 50p to n o n -
members (you can join at the door).
Industrial
I begin with a puzzle: what exactly motivates
people like " N . Wilson", Chris Wilshaw Fan
Club Chairman and author of last week's
Alternative View to get involved in slagging off
industry? a) is he plagued by bugs? b) can he
not get a job? c) has he tumbled our tractor
tyre operation? d) is a sinecure a tropical
disease?
Seriously folks, a few thoughts:
1. Considering the amount of time and
effort C h r i s W i l s h a w (the C h a i r m a n ) has
devoted to the Society's activities, questioning
his motives is superfluous as well as petty. (He
has no "job lined up").
2. Making money has a strong appeal to
most people.
3. Many others which I shan't list here (see
Chris Wilshaw's letter).
So, on to the secrets of our diary. The trip to
British Steel at Sheffield was very successful—
we hope that all concerned enjoyed the event.
Today we present a talk by British Gas:
' B r i t a i n s ' s E n e r g y P o l i c y u n t i l the Y e a r
2000'—a glamorous (?) subject which affects
us all. This begins at 1:00pm in Theatre 1,
C h e m Eng (entrances opposite Beit and by the
Bookshop). Everybody welcome, especially N .
Wilson—'Da boys will be dere Luigi'
Next week: Wednesday sees the Courtaulds
visit then on Thursday, November 12 we invite
you to hear a 'Brief profile of a financial career
with Unilever; also at 1pm in C h e m Eng L T 1 .
O h well, I must fill in another job application
form. Bye.
S F Soc
O n c e again the T u r v e y s a m e mind of the
bulletin compilers (your friendly neighbour-
hood gestalt) leaps into action to bring you
previously untold delights normally spoken of
only behind the door of the myslerius green
room, or "green room" as people who like
inverted commas call it, on Thursday (tell me
why). Coming on November the tenth, one of
the ten greatest films ever made, yes its 2001-A
Space Odyssey. Come along and thrill to the
cashmere sweater mystery, stare rapt at the
love scene in the car, laugh at B B C 12 and
puzzle at the extract from a Jewish wedding.
C o n f u s e d ? Y o u won't be after the next
showing of 2001. Also coming soon—but this
isn't r o c k b o t t o m definite y e t — w e are
negotiating for a showing of "* *********
******''; the film that hasn't been banned, you
can't show it, that's all. The film that everyone
(well, nearly everyone) wants to see is in the
pipeline, so keep your fingers crossed and
watch this space. N o , Stanley Kubrick doesn't
have a monopoly on good S F films. There are
at least four other good ones as well as his two.
What's he working on now? I've no idea. The
S F Soc President is Graham Woodhouse. I
just thought I'd throw that in because a couple
of members sat next to him at a party and
didn't realise who he was recently. A n d y
Warhol once said that in the future everyone
will be famous for fifteen minutes. Hard luck
Graham. Y o u may like to know that the B B C
are about to show lots of old Dr Who episodes.
What you may not know is that they will be
shown at a time when IC students will be very
hard pushed to see them. It looks as if it's going
to be the Prisoner all over again. So it goes.
Don't forget Tuesday, November 10, 6:30pm,
Mech Eng 220 2001. Be seeing you. I know that
things haven't been all right with me lately, but
they can be all right again.
C'roderick and the Innsmouth Angling Club.
(** etc A s this will definitely be members
only, and we don't want you to be jealous,
come to meetings for names, etc.).
Mistress of Chaos
Welfare
Did you know that I C U has its own Welfare
Officer? Probably not, since I don't go around
making a big song and dance of it. Well, it's five
weeks into term now and no-one has given me
anything to do, so I'm out to find something. I
wonder if you could help!
Firstly, do you rent a flat/bedsit under a
licence or tenancy agreement about which you
aren't entirely happy? (Have you read it?) I'm
compiling a list of ludicrous clauses for future
discussion, and I need lots of material, so
please drop by and see me. Let me take a copy
of your agreement (I'll keep it confidential).
S e c o n d l y , I intend to try to get some
speakers in from outside to discuss issues
relevant to our general welfare (drugs, V D ,
gays, etc.), but I'm not sure that my ideas will
c o - i n c i d e w i t h y o u r s — if y o u h a v e any
suggestions, I'd like to hear them.
So, if you want to help/comment about
either of these, or have anything else you want
to see me about, please drop me a note in the
U n i o n Office or c o m e and see me next
Monday or Friday (November 9 and 13) in the
U n i o n U p p e r L o u n g e between 12:30 and
2:00pm.
Cheers.

ICU Welfare Officer
Consoc
Don't forget the House of Commons trip today
(November 6) to all members who put their
names down at the Wine and Cheese Party.
Meet Beit A r c h at 1:00pm.
Our next social event will be a trip to see
Anyone for Denis? at the Whitehall Theatre on
Tuesday, November 24. Seats available at
£3.50 (Upper Circle) by cheque from myself
c/o C h e m Eng letter-racks. See the current
Morning Cloud newsletter for further details,
but be quick—there are only thirty places
available.

Vice Chairman
Amnesty
O n November 30, the people of Benin will be
celebrating their National Day. To coincide
with this event the IC Amnesty Group has
decided to organise a massive 'Swamp Benin's
Postal System' campaign.
We are hoping to send off a vast number of
letters asking the President of Benin, Colonel
Kerekou, to release our "adopted" prisoner,
Firmin Awadon, as an act of clemency. O n
Thursday, November 12, we will have a stall in
the J C R where you can come and sign one of
these letters. (There will also be a variety of
pamphlets, books and Christmas cards on
show.)
Living in a democratic society we must
speak out for the politically oppressed of other
nations, otherwise we do not deserve our
'right' to 'freedom of speech'. It is this 'right'
that we take so lightly, that so many people in
other countries are prepared to die for.
Please support our campaign. Meetings are
held every Tuesday at 5:30pm in the Green
Committee Room (top floor, Union Building).
Bookshop News

goblets and hip flasks. -Engraving to your
own design can be arranged. The range of
