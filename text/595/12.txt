Wing Tsun
T h e C h i n e s e m e t h o d of attack and self-
defence was kept a secret handed down in
China from father to son, because of its deadly
power to disable or kill.
The Chinese martial art of Kung F u does not
consist entirely of aggression; it is far more
than that. It is a philosophy and a culture.
The basis of Wing Tsun Kung F u is humility
arid self-respect. Should it be needed for self-
defence the approach is to seek out opponents
weaknesses and prevent him from attacking,
not to batter him to the ground. We attempt to
instil a b s o l u t e s e l f - c o n t r o l a n d a b a n d o n
such self-damaging attitudes as greed and
hate.
W h e n a practitioner reaches the very
pinnacle of Wing Tsun, he is said to be free
from any mundane rules, forms and regula-
tions. H e is a pragmatic fighter, elusive,
unfixable and completely unpredictable. Wing
Tsun becomes an art of self-expression. t
M r Simon Lau who studied Wing Tsun Kung
F u in H o n g K o n g thinks there are more
important aspects to the art than the high
kicking violence featured in many of Bruce
Lee's hit films. "The one thing many young
people don't realise when they see Bruce Lee's
films is that he was above average in strength
and style. They think that they can achieve his
strength after a few lessons.
Kung F u is a potentially dangerous art. If
taught by unqualified persons it can result in
serious injury. M r Lau is very concerned about
this and hopes that youngsters will take more
care in choosing their teachers.
A division of M r Lau's Wing Tsun Academy •
was formed at Imperial College Union in his
academic year. Training takes place in the
Union Gymnasium on Wednesday between
3:00 and 6:00pm and Saturday between 11:00
and 2:00pm. Anybody interested in the art is
welcome to join.

Canoe
Last weekend the club went to the River Dee
in N o r t h W a l e s . T h e main event of the
weekend was the World Cardboard Canoeing
Championships, which took place on a two
hundred yard course, including the Serpents
Tail, one of the best rapids we have in this
c o u n t r y . T h e IC entry was a three-man
Canadian canoe, and as you would expect the
cardboard engineering was of a high standard.
With the three cardboardists at the peak of
physical fitness our hopes were high.
Unfortunately this was not to be. Despite an
encouraging start, sogginess started occuring
at the later stages of the race, and cardboard
collapse happened just before the finish. This
was still an impressive entry though, as there
were only three finishes out of about twenty-
five starters in the cardboard multiclass event.
The weekend also saw some more normal
canoeing for both novices and experts on the
River Dee. The novices were introduced to
whitew?ter on the scenic upper section of the
D e e , while those w i t h m o r e e x p e r i e n c e
attempted the more difficult lower section to
Llangollen, with varying degrees of success.
Anyone interested in joining the club is
welcome to come and try the sport in the
s w i m m i n g pool between 6:30 and 8:00pm
every Tuesday.
ICYHA
Well, we finally made it to a hostel at last. (Our
first attempt was foiled by a blown engine in
the van.) A s the van was not quite ready for
action we had to travel by train; the location
being Arundel Youth Hostel set in the valley of
the river Arun and surrounded by the hills of
the South Downs. Arriving on Friday evening
there was just enough time for a quick drink
and a bit to eat before returning to the hostel.
O n Saturday we walked over the tops of the
S o u t h D o w n s a n d t h r o u g h the a u t u m n
woodlands in the area. Sunday saw us going in
a different d i r e c t i o n , w a l k i n g d o w n the
somewhat wet and muddy banks of the river to
the sea a few miles away, before returning to
College by train in the evening.
Having successfully completed this weekend,
we should now have a full program for the rest
of this term. Today a group of us are off to the
Chiltern hills for a weekend's cycling and next
weekend, with the return of the van, we will be
off to see the Cotswolds. Other destinations
later this term will be S n o w d o n and the
Yorkshire Dales. If you are interested in going
on any of these trips (cost around £10) come
along to our weekly meeting in Southside
Upper Lounge every Thursday from 12:30 till
2:00pm.
Community Action Group

help with the elderly patients. Either regular

The R C S Centenary fortnight is getting close
now, so keep a look out for details a n d
agendas. Most important of course is the Ball,
which is on Friday, November 27. The price is
£28 for a double ticket, for which you get three
bands, a whacking great meal, a disco and
gallons of booze. Please don't wait until the last
moment to buy your ticket.
Anyway, not much seems to be happening
this week, apart from the R C S Rag collection
tomorrow. This takes the unprecedented step
of using our house-to-house licences to collect
house-to-house. See Broadsheet, etc., for
more details, but meet at 10:00am in the R C S
Office. We're now £400 behind Guilds Rag
total, so it's time to put in some extra effort!
City & Guilds
On Saturdays, we collected £640 for rag. This
is a silly sports all-time record and puts the
Guilds total to over £1,500. It also puts us £400.
