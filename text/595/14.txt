dangerous on the break but some l i n e
defensive play by the I C backs and good
mauling from the forwards set up two more
tries lor T i m C a r r and J o h n Weir.
The best try of the match came at the
beginning of the second hall with nearly all
the forwards touching the ball before M a r k
Pearce crashed over the line.
Persistent pressure by the team produced
another try for A n d y R a l p h and the match
was rounded off by two more tries from fly-
half John Weir.

Thirds
Due to the injury problems in the first and
second teams the Thirds were left two players
short, but as it 'appened C h a r i n g Cross
arrived an hour late with twelve. Meanwhile
during the wait, the B2's had " b o r r o w e d "
two players. C o n s e q u e n t l y , a very fast
running game was played with IC dictating
the speed of play. C h a r i n g Cross could not
tackle fast enough to prevent six tries being
run in. Each try was the result of continued
looping, switching and support play between
both the backs and the forwards. The I C
pack, although picking up good loose ball
were handicapped in the tight by not having
a recognised hooker. O n l y one of the six tries
was converted because again I C had no
kicker.-
It must be emphasised that it was a team
performance in which every member of the
team played rugby as it should be played.
The C h a r i n g Cross skipper summed it up in
the bar later " W h y don't more people play
third fifteen rugby?"

Fourths
IC Seconds watch out! The Fourths quickly
o v e r c a m e t h e d i s a p p o i n t m e n t of last
Wednesday's defeat with an encouraging
first-round C u p w i n at R o y a l Holloway.
The game started badly when, against the
run of play. Holloway scored two goals, but
this only inspired the Fourths to a greater
effort. Dave M c P h a i l went close to scoring on
s e v e r a l o c c a s i o n s a n d t h e n , w i t h the
goalkeeper beaten, a H o l l o w a y defender
desperately stopped the ball with his hands.
R i c h D o l a n ' s s h a k i n g knees p r o v e d no
handicap as his crisply struck penalty kick
gave the keeper no chance.
Almost immediately Holloway restored
their two goal lead with a slick attack, but the
Fourths fought back bravely with goals from
J o h n Rigby and Dave H a r d y . Just before
half-time, R i c h Heath inadvertently knocked
a low cross into his own net. but made
amends in the second half with an aggressive
contribution.
Holloway rarely penetrated the IC back
four of Heath. C h o w n , Savage and K i n d r e d ,
who had indicated earlier his ball winning
technique by tackling a lamp post with his
head.
Dave G l a d m a n , Rick Dolan and Dave
H a r d y prompted from midfield until J o h n
Rigby scored a well deserved equaliser. The
goal that clinched the tie came from M i c k
McNicholas when he curled the ball oxer the
goalkeeper from twenty-live yards.
Holloway's final attempts to save the game
were foiled by solid defensive work and some
excellent goalkeeping by A n d y Slater.

Ladies
O n Saturday, October 31, in the first round
of the U L C u p , I C certainly earned their 5-4
victory over Guys 1. W i t h only nine players
against ten we were soon very tired and were
under a lot of pressure from their forwards,
who were very organised in the first half.
H o w e v e r , a couple of shots from A l i s o n
C r u m b i e meant we went 2-1 up until our
captain levelled the score by a nicely placed
home goal.
O u r defence was much improved at the
start of the second half and our third goal
came Irom the centre hall, Sara H a l b a r d , as a
result of a c o o r d i n a t e d m o v e w i t h the
forwards. Guys pulled it back to three all, but
two more attacks made it 5-3 to I C , the two
goals coming from K a r e n Barnett. By this
time there was still twenty minutes of play
left and both teams were very tired. Guys
were determined to win and made it 5-4. The
final minutes saw our goal under a lot of
pressure but some b r i l l i a n t k e e p i n g by
Alison Coates and defence work by the backs
meant we held our lead to make the final
score 5-4.
M a n y thanks to the whole team for putting
in so much effort.
Team: A. Coates, A. Crumbie, S. Halbard, C.
Brown, C. Walker, J. Birbeck, M. Buchanan, R.
Mason, K. Barnetl.
Firsts
IC soon went down to a well taken goal by
the opposition. U n d e r considerable pressure,
we conceded another goal due to an error by
the goalkeeper. Fortunately, an excellent
goal by Bansal reduced the deficit to one goal
at half-time (despite J o h n Clarke's efforts to
put the ball into his own net).
In the second half, the Firsts looked good
enough to equalise, but N P L managed to
snatch another goal from a short corner. O u r
spirits were lifted briefly as Bansal again
buried fhe ball deep into the opposition's net.
N P L gained their final goal after a lucky
deflection wrong-footed the defence.
Team: Butler, Coatesworth, Riley, Franklin,
Parker, Clarke, Rao, Cray, Ayers, Bell, Bansal,
Baleson.
Seconds
The day got off to a bad start, with the
seconds sniggering at their captain's inability
to remember where he had left the shirts.
However, once this problem had been sorted
out, after scouring hall of West London, the
team made it to Teddington without further
trouble. At this point, the team's confidence
in their leader dropped still further as a 'short
cut' to the sports ground ended up at a ten
foot high wire fence.
In the match itself, goalkeeper R o l l Slatter,
playing like a cross between Evel K n e i v e l
and the K i r o v Ballet, kept us in the game
with a series of brilliant saves. Despite brave
defensive work, the team conceded its usual
goal just after hall time. The match then
followed the familiar pattern lor this season
with IC totally dominating ihe opposition
without creating any clear-cut chances, and
finally conceding a second goal to an N P L
b r e a k a w a y . D e s p i t e the fact that t h e i r
c a p t a i n d i d s o m e t h i n g to s a l v a g e his
reputation by actually getting a shot on
target late in the game, the team never really
looked like pulling back the two-goal deficit.
Thanks are due to A n d y Whitehead lor some
excellent umpiring and to Pete Hughes for
keeping quiet!

Thirds
I C T h i r d s put up k v a l i a n t d i s p l a y of
exhaustion x t the end of a tiring 9-1 defeat,
every memberTriairaged to down at least one
pint just to-shoW'now tired they were. Despite
the scoreline it was a good performance by I C ,
who played with three players missing in the
first half, managing to keep the score down to
3-0. In the second h a l l T C gained a player but
having run so much in the first hall, creating
a couple ol scoring chances, they were unable
to match the opposition who went on to score
another six goals. IC scored a consolation
goal through E d , this was most amusing as
only E d knew what was happening with the
opposition standing still.
