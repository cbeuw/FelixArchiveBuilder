Jez and Bo romp home
I.asl Sunday, Bo and Jez took part in die annual London-Brighton
veteran ear run, both completing the hundred mile round trip with no
major mechanical mishaps.
Boanerges, so-called alter the sons of thunder, is registered with the
Veteran C a r C l u b of (heat Britian as a 1904 James and Browne
tonneau. She was sent on her way from Hyde Park at 8:00am by some
hundred C & G supporters (several still clad in their pyjamas) who then
followed their motorised mascot in two coaches.
The R G S , unable to compete with such a degree of organisation,
had a rather lower turn-out of ten, mostly because, in a flurry of
efficiency they had told everyone to meet at the R G S Office shortly
after Jez had left. As Jez is not officially eligible for the run, being a
post-1965 fire-engine rather than a pre? 1904 car, she joined the convoy
outside Hyde Park and attracted a great many cheers from the
enthusiastic crowds that lined the fifty-three mile route.
O n arriving in Brighton, the participants divided their lime
between various pubs and amusements [larks—notably the dodgems.
C l e m , the R S M lorry, continued a long tradition by not taking part,
primarily because she is still in A i l 'fix-kit form in three large cardboard
boxes somewhere near Aldershot. T h e official reason for this is that the
R S M do not have a garage in I C ; however, they also admitted that
they have most carelessly lost the engine.

displacing his remarkable lack of singing voice. T h e meeting w a - ilici
adjourned to the Queens.
The N U S representative who
eventually arrived in Huxley 213
lasl Wednesday to speak on the
N T ' S turned out to be Andy
Pcrmain, Vice-President Educa-
tion for N U S . Apologising for
D a v e A a r o n o v i t c h ' s absence".
S t e v e G o u l d e r , C h a i r m a n ,
explained that this was due to
Dave having bronchitis.
Andy (having apologised lor
his late arrival) proceeded to give
a rough outline ol what N U S was
all about. H e e x p l a i n e d that
N U S was u n i q u e , both on a
national and international level,
in being independent of political
parties: the iwo main functions of
N T ' S being advice lo students
and national representation of
students to establishments such as
the government, trade unions,
education authorities and the
media. Expanding on ihis he
spoke on the three present major
concerns ol N U S . these being
c uis. grants and unemployment.
M r Peimain's argument lor IG
I nion's rcaffiliation to N U S was
lo b r e a k d o w n the 'sense o f
isolation from other unions,
oilier sec tors ol lurlhcr education
and national representation and
lo enable the sharing ol ideas and
problems with other unions and
levels ol education.
Otl asking the lloor for ques-
tions, queries were raised as (o
the cost of affiliation, which was
estimated lo he around £20000:
and also as to what benelil I C
societies could receive Irom N U S .
This was answered as advice on
the running ol social activities
drawn Irom the experience of
other unions.
Ihe point ol had representation
ol student opinions al national
conferences due to the majority
ol d e l e g a t e s sent I r o m o t h e r
colleges not being elected was
raised a n d A n d y agreed that
moves should be made for greater
participation in conferences a n d
recommendations made lor the
election ol delegates.
Nick M o r t o n , President of I C
U n i o n , asked if M r P c r m a i n
would accept that mosl of the
N U S executive had started out
communist and moved left, a n d
received in reply thai it was
misleading lo transpose national
politics onto studeni organisa-
tions.
In all a lively debate was held;
A n d y finished on the question ol
how the N U S had changed in the
lasl l o u r years. H e s a i d he
though) it more constructive and
positive, not just destructive and
negative.
Il is hoped that Dave Aarono-
vitch will be able to attend the I C
U G M on Tuesday, November
10. in the Great Hall.
