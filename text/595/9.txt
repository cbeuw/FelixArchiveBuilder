Down to Earth
IC Christian Union-a week of events
Many people think that we live in a world without hope. Some wrap
themselves up with their careers, their family, sport, entertainment, etc.,
trying not to look too far ahead. Others devote their energies to politics,
sometimes for personal power, often in an attempt to find solutions to
society's problems. Often they find the problems of society are deep and
extensive and the answers none too effective. It's in this context that we
ask whether or not Christianity is relevant.
Society is made up of individuals and Christians believe that it is in the
individual (you and me) that the problem lies. The Bible says that the root
cause is that we live without regard to G o d . Both our action and our
inaction separate us from G o d (technically our sin).
Throughout history we have shown ourselves to be powerless to sort
ourselves out in this respect. Nowadays we are not technologically
disable, morally so, failing to apply the wonders we discover as G o d
would have us do.
God's answer is "down to earth" in two ways. O n the one hand it's
relevant and on the other it involved the sacrifice of himself. As you may
gather, this title refers to Jesus Christ, God's Son and the good news
about him.
That he was born as a man (sent down to earth), lived a life without sin,
was executed for no good reason and has been raised, from death to life
with G o d . The Bible puts it this way:
You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless,
Christ died for the ungodly. But God demonstrates his own love
for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
By raising Chist from death, G o d showed that he accepts Christ's
sacrifice of himself for our sin and has removed the banner which
separates us from him, so that:
Whoever believes in him (Christ) shall not perish but have
everlasting life.
It we believe in Christ, and turn to G o d (away from sin) he offers a
personal friendship to us, putting everything else we value in its proper
place, and he makes life well worth living. At first sight it seems too good
to be true, but then G o d is practical and knows what we need.
The purpose of this next week is that people should know that
Christianity is about the good news of Jesus Christ leading to a dynamic
relationship with the living G o d .

Who's Who
David Marrow: David will be the speaker at three of the evening
meetings. He is a vicar from the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight. Before
studying theology at St. John's College, Nottingham, and at Tyndale Hall,
Bristol, he was a door-to-door salesman for a vacuum cleaning company.
He has worked in the church in Ethopia for four years leaving when the
recent war began. He is married with four young children.
Richard Meyrick: Richard is a professional concert pianist of some
standing. He began to study the piano at the age of ten, more recently at
the Royal College of Music. He has toured Poland, Canada, the U S A and
next year the Soviet Union. Richard is a Christian and finds that G o d
relates to him—even in his music.
Cornerstone Theatre Company: C o r n e r s t o n e are a g r o u p of
professional actors based at Jesmond Parish C h u r c h in Newcastle-upon-
Tyne. They are made up of three men and two girls and will be
