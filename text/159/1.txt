I. C. UNLUCKY IN RELAY
Saturday 25th Feb. saw what must be the
highlight of the season for I.C. — the Hyde
Park Road Relay. This year we had a
record entry of 75 teams to run over the
new three mile course round the Serpent-
ine in Hyde Park. In spite of a bad
start the weather brightened up and the
race was started in a blaze of sunlight by
Jack Crump. St. Edmunds Hall, Oxford
led for the first two laps but were over-
hauled soon in the third lap as Man-
chester, Leeds and Loughborough moved
through. Ted Wilkins set the I.C. Team
off to their best start for years, leading
at the half way mark, and handing over
in 4th place. Dave Hammonds running
well against the stiff opposition did well
to hang on to the leading group and
handed over 8th. Pete Warren on the third
lap brought us steadily up through the
field again to 5th place and handed over
to John Collins in an excellent position
for catching the leaders. This he proceeded
to do wth masterful determination, tak-
ing the lead at the half way point' with
Manchester dropping back to 5th. John
Cleator, on the fifth stage set out a ben
second lead and proceeded to increase
this to 30 seconds, doing the third fastest
time of the day and running a very well
judged race. Loughborough w

e hang-
ing on to second place and Birmingham
third, while Manchester had moved up
to fourth and Queen's College Camb. to
fifth place. The tension mounted as George
Wenk, our last man set out with a thirty
second lead and we watched first Hill
of Manchester, and Turner of Queen's,
following in hot pursuit; Turner being

and Hill the runner-up. At the half way
stage our lead had dropped to 13 seconds
and with a mile to go we were ten seconds
ahead, but with a great burst of speed, Hill
broke past Turner and Wenk and finished
a great race to give Manchester a very
creditable victory. Turner finished with
the fastest time of the day in second
place winning the Minor Colleges Trophy
for" Queen's. George Wenk hung on gal-
lantly to give I.C. third place just beat-
ing Birmingham by one second. The I.C.
team's position was much better than we
had dared to hope for and they must all
be congratulated on a very fine achiev-
ment.

MASCOT KIDNAPPED
by "Herbert"
Here is firsthand report of the incident.
"I was invited by a friend of mine to
meet some members, mostly female, of
the London University Dramatic Society.
We "
m
e
t in his room and had coffee. I
was in a lousy mood and if it hadn't been
for an extremely interesting blonde drama
student I would soon have departed. As
it was, the party went to the Six Bells,
and thence, for coffee, to the drama
student's flat. While the coffee waB being
made, one of the other students came to
me with a belt in her hand.
"I would like to inform you that you've
been kidnapped", she said to me. This
was the last straw.
"Oh, really?" I said. "Well I feel no
different to what I did a few minutes ago.
I'm still sitting here."
Her reply to this was to make a lunge
at my spectacles with a cry: "You HAVE
been kidnapped; we've leaving here now."
I grabbed my spectacles, and said:
"Stop being staipid and sit down! I came
here for coffee AMD COFFEE I'M GOING
TO HAVE!"
They all went into long Secret Service-
type whispers. I interrupted them by say-
ing I wished to go to the lavatory. This
caused consternation! Finally they extr-
acted from me a promise that I would
come back, and they backed this up by
posting people at the doors, on the stairs,
and at the windows. How stupid can one
get?
Eventually they agreed that since I
seemed to be in a bad mood they would
only take me as far as U.L.U, where
they would photograph me.
It appeared that the whole idea was
a publicity stunt for a play they are do-
ing, called '"The Prisoner". However, the
whole idea seemed absolutely stupid, the
adolescent action of a conglomeration of
existentialist idiots, the neolithic ravings
of obfuscated partisans.
Well, at any rate, the Imperial College
Mascot is once again back in residence.
r YOUTH WORK

the week-end to this worthy cause. If you
are interested in this, or any other types
of youth work, please contact R.J. BalcLey

GUILDS WIN
DEBATING
G U P
The second round of the competition
took place on February 16th. The motion
was "That modern advertising is imor-
al."Both Guilds and R.C.S. put up a high
standard but the Guilds team won by a
quite large majority; their victory was
undoubtedly due to. their teamwork and
the excellent take-off of modern advert-
ising by Jim Carter.
The last round took place on 23rd Fe-
bruary. The motion was "That television
is the idiot's lantern." Guilds, proposing
this, took a humorous view typified by
Norman Greaves who said that if a man
carried a television set about his house
as a lantern then that would indeed be
an idiot. Mines opposing were more ser-
ious and John Loome in a first-rate sum-
ming-up ripped to pieces the frail hypo-
thesis of illogical argument set by the
Guilds team. Thus Mines won the debate.
Nevertheless the total gave Guilds the
overall win and they will be awarded the
Imperial College Union Debating Chal-
lenge Cup. The jugdes, led by Jack Mc-
Couby, said that 0uilds had shown a
consistantly high level of debating though
Mines had put up a good fight in the last
debate.
The Competition seems to have aroused
a new interest in debating and all the col-
leges seem anxious to have another go
next year.
IMPERIAL CLOSE SECOND IN
UNIVERSITY PLAY FESTIVAL
On Thursday, February 23rd Imperial
College Dramatic Society performed "The
Black Stirk's Light" at Battersea Col-
lege. The play presents a powerful study
of a husband's jealousy of the sometime
school-friend of his younger wife in the
confinement and isolation of an ocean
lighthouse. The situation is developed as
suspicion of Billy's relationship with his
wife grows upon Angus, an embittered
former sea-captain, despite all the efforts
of the third 'keeper, Nat, to prevent
trouble on the eve of his retirement.
In his adjudication, Mr. William Ken-
dall commended the coherence of Peter
Bowden's production and was impressed
ay the most impressive set, created by
John Darling and lighted by Collin Win-
row.- Apart from too much noise from
John Horrocks, too little from John Gor-
don and insufficient bounce from Brian
Connelly, the actors were also commended
for their performance.
The Festival showed an interesting sel-
ection of plays to very poor audiences,
due, one hopes, rather to its being held
so far from U.L.U. than to complete lack
of interest. Mr. Kendall, pointing this out
in his final summing up on Friday, noted
also that the standard of production was
fairly uniform, there being nothing really
bad and nothing really outstanding, except
possibly the excellent, but non-competitive
production of Pinter's "The Dumb
Waiter" by Q.M.C. He went on to com-
mend particular points arising from some
of the plays, mentioning "The Black
Stirk's Light" on the basis of the set,
Peter Bowden's production and the acting
of John Hjorrocks and Brian Connelly,
and said that he found it very difficult to
decide between the best three productions
of the"*Festival. With only few marks be-
tween them, he played King's "The Room"
by Harold Pinter 3rd, Imperial College
2nd, and awarded the Clee Cup to Gold-
smith's (for at least the second year run-
ning) , for an original play by one of their
cast, "The Noisy Whimper".
It is hoped to present ''The Black
Stirk's Light" to the College during Car-
nival Week and nearer at hand, the Dra-
matic Society's Easter production "The
Ascent of F6." by W.H. Auden and
Christopher Isherwood, may be seen from
20-23 March.
