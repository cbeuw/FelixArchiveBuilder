Color Out of Space (2020)
N
athan Gardener
( N i c o l a s
Cage), his
wife and three
children live a secluded
and peaceful life. The
Gardeners have managed
to rip themselves away
from city life and current-
ly manage to thrive with
minimal disruption from
the outside world. All
is well until a colourful
meteorite falls outside the
Gardener residence and
changes the fabric of real-
ity around the family and
their home. Based on the
book of the same name
by H. P. Lovecraft, writer
of well renowned short
stories such as The call
of Chuthulu, I can’t help
but believe this movie ad-
aptation diverges slightly
from what it means to be
Lovecraftian.
One of the pleasures
of seeing this film on the
big screen is the chance to
enjoy the natural beauty
of the secluded forest the
Gardners live in. This is
mirrored perfectly in the
idyllic family dynamic
that is witnessed as a
definite calm before the
storm. Once the meteorite
lands, we are able to sense
a slowly building change
that affects everything
from the water to the
behaviors of people and
animals alike. The already
gorgeous beauty of the
location is enhanced as
if touched up by some
ethereal paintbrush and
despite the increasingly
strange behaviour of the
family in reaction to the
crash, it is the changes to
nature that I found myself
wanting more of. This
ends up being my mistake.
We soon learn that there is
no bigger picture to look
forward to and before
long the film becomes
an overwhelming and
horrific assault on all the
senses. Think self-mutila-
tion, cancerous mutations
and radiation burn. Later
learning that some of the
most awful parts of this
film were not necessarily
a part of the original story
was incredibly frustrating.
This is especially due to
the interests of the film
studio Spectrevision
having spent nine years
searching for a true to the
story take on the novella.
Writer and director
a larger audience with a
greater cultural impact.
Much of what I feel is
lacking from Color out
of Space I believe can
be found successfully
executed in 2018’s Anni-
hilation, which is itself
loosely based on the same
Lovecraft short story.
Some of the challenges
faced by the writers of
this adaptation is bringing
the story to the 21st
century and padding out
what is essentially a fifty
six page story to make a
feature length film. One
of the choices made by the
writing team was to make
Mrs. Gardner a survivor
of breast cancer, a fasci-
nating decision bearing in
mind that one of the core
themes of Annihilation
is also cancer and how it
creates an unfavourable
alternative reality for
those affected by it.
Acting as a remedy to
so much horror were some
remarkable performances
by the cast. In particular
Gardner’s daughter,
Lavinia (Madeleine
Arthur), who manages to
play the role of an angsty
teen mentally battling the
ever-changing unravelling
of her reality powerfully,
taking nightmarish scenes
and, at times, baffling
dialogue in her stride.
Nicholas Cage also does
not disappoint as the
patriarch, a somewhat
obsessive novice farmer
and avid drinker of alpaca
milk. One of the more dis-
appointing performances
comes from the unnamed
visiting hydrologist
(Elliot Knight), our sto-
ryteller, whose sole role
of reacting to the Gardner
family ordeal is dwarfed
by the intensity of the rest
of the cast.
For me, the audience
reaction helped to high-
light the more lighthearted
moments of this movie.
The ridiculousness of
Mr. Gardner’s perpetual
concern for his alpacas,
for example. The sad
irony of this audience
reaction is the deep
belly laughter to scenes
that were intended to be
sincere moments of grief
or fear. Especially seeing
as producer Daniel Noah
released in a statement
that to his dismay many
adaptations of Lovecraft
seem to lack sincerity by
taking the comedic route,
claiming that “there was
nothing funny about
Lovecraft’’.
As a reward for
sitting through what I
can promise feels like
an eternity of horror,
we are gifted with thirty
minutes of unnecessary,
unintelligible chaos which
manages to end satisfy-
ingly. Color out of Space
manages to bring to life a
short story from the early
20th century with notable
qualities, including the
thoughtful use of colour
and design throughout.
On reflection after the film
and after asking myself if
all the choices made in
the film were necessary, I
felt torn. How else would
a film be able to convince
me of the unimaginable
alternative reality that

“One of the
pleasures of
seeing this
film on the
big screen is
the chance
to enjoy the
natural beauty
of the forest
scenery used”
“A remedy
to so much
horror was an
ensemble of
remarkable
performances
from some of
the cast”
Richard Stanley treads a
fine line between making
this one hundred year old
story relevant and losing
the essence of what it
means to be Lovecraftian,
which is less graphic
gore but the more subtle
yet overwhelming fear
of the unknown and the
fragility and meekness
of humans in relation to
the vast cosmos. If there
had been a way to convey
the absolute horror of the
alien invaders in a way
that did not overwhelm
the audience with gro-
tesque imagery, I believe
this film could appeal to
“The impact
of the horror
and gore
ends up being
unremarkable”
could exist in the universe
than by showing me how
uncomfortable I feel
when exposed to things so
unnatural? However, the
impact of the horror and
the gore ends up being un-
remarkable despite such a
brilliant start.
Color out of Space
comes out in cinemas
on the 28th of February.
Catch it if you dare!
