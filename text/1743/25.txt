U
nconsciously,
by coming to
study at such a
culturally rich
university, and proudly
harbouring that red lan-
yard as a fresher, we tend
to associate ourselves to
separate and diverse stu-
dent entities: an imperial
undergraduate, an RCSU
member, a life scientist,
and a biochemist, for
example. As recent polit-
ical events have shown,
a national identity may
overtake a continental
European one. One of
the biggest challenges
that the RCSU faces is
to bridge 3000 students
from Maths, Physics,
Chemistry, Biochemistry
and Biology together as a
single entity beyond their
departmental level. One
way of promoting this is
through the social, sport,
and RAG organisation of
large interdepartmental
events. It is, however,
important to bear in mind
that we wish to achieve
this by working along-
side the departmental
societies and without
event cross-interference.
Thus, event logistics
(dates, times, location
and types of event) and
publicity methods need to
be carefully planned out,
overcoming a number of
hurdles. Our successes
and failures provide the
opportunity to develop as
the Activities Committee
as well as reﬂecting on
why it is we volunteer.
In the RCSU one of our
fundamental aims, espe-
cially within the activities
team, is to create events
bringing you wonderful
people and your wonder-
ful cultures together. At
Imperial we celebrate our
differences, and we wish
to reﬂect that in the events
we provide. As evidently
as within people, the
more distinctive and more
plentiful the activities the
more joyous the fruits of
interaction and participa-
tion.
Foodie lover RAG
ofﬁcer Karl Lee shares
his RCSU success guide
through a beautiful and
stomach-teasing analogy
where events are the key
driving force (on top of
dedication, motivation
and teamwork of course!):
“I recently visited the
Union Bar to test out
the refreshed edition of
Imperial College Cheesy
Curly Fries. I breathed
heavily as I clutched the
warm box of fries, eager to
taste the greasy goodness
within. Opening the box,
I separated a chunk of
cheesy potato and lifted
it into my mouth. The air
was tense. My taste buds
erupted in a violent hurri-
cane of sensations: salty,
fatty, crispy, soft – all
combined so ingeniously
together in a torrent of
tastiness.
I think of the RCSU just
as I think of those cheesy
curly fries.Asticky but de-
licious mess, reminiscent
of that complex matrix of
potatoes, oil, and melted
cheese. Individually, each
bit of the RCSU is not par-
ticularly strong, just as an
individual potato fry is not
particularly noticeable or
ﬂavourful. Yet as a whole,
it is a powerfully delicious
force; a union between a
diverse range of students.
The slew of RCSU events
and activities; pub-
crawls, quizzes, charity
events, nights-out – this
is the thick, cheesy glue
that brings departments
together. Broadsheet,
the Science Challenge,
BAHfest, and many other
initiatives that make the
RCSU different - these are
the jagged, crusty edges, a
mix of melted cheese and
burnt potato. Finally, the
immense body of students
that form the RCSU; these
are the fries, the key basis
of the whole structure; the
element that is essential to
the dish”.
Next up, table tennis
fan and Sports Ofﬁcer,
Mihir Varsani reﬂecting
upon sports as a major
driving force for a stronger
union: “Within sports, the
divisions between depart-
ments of the faculty can be
exploited to create unity.
The competitive nature of
sport allows social events
to be created that pitch
departments against each
other. Throughout my
degree, I have found that
representing your ﬁeld
and trying to prove your
superiority over the others
is a strong incentive for
participation. However,
events must be organised
so that the competitive
nature is utilised in
a friendly manner as
faculty cohesion must be
promoted over further
enhancing the divisions.
Creating events to ﬁt
these criteria has proven
to be difﬁcult, particularly
when implementing them
on the large faculty-wide
scale”.
All in all, the success-
fulness of any student led
organisation should rely
on efﬁcient teamwork
and communication to
lead and promote diverse
events. It is as a team
that we celebrate our
successes, as a team that
we confront the bumps
along the road and as a
team that we give back
to the Imperial Commu-
nity. Hence it is a priority
that the voice of every
member is heard to not
only generate ever more
original events but also
ensure that they have fun
in the process!
