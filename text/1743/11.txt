On McQuillan’s Hill:AGay IRAVolunteer Walks into
a Bar...
I
n the rural town of
Gentry, old IRA
volunteer Fra Maline
has been released
from prison – earlier than
expected, thanks to the
Good Friday Agreement.
At the community hall
on McQuillan’s hill, his
daughter has thrown him a
homecoming party. By co-
incidence, Fra’s sister has
reappeared in Northern
Ireland for the first time
in twenty years and,
unbeknownst to everyone,
bought that very same
community hall. What
follows is the tightening
calculus of family con-
flicts, reckonings with a
war most would like to
forget, and a digging at
secrets best left buried.
Indeed, there are
treasures worth unburying
in On McQuillan’s Hill
(Joseph Crilly): a rich
Hiberno-English patter
colours the play – this
is dialogue as it should
be, balanced on a knife
edge between laughter
and violence and ready to
plunge into either as the
strings of relationships
entwine and slacken. I
spent a childhood catching
the dulcet tones of Doric
and retained enough to
enjoy the banter; a crash-
course in Ulster Scots
might get you more out
of the production, but
neither dialect nor accent
is thick enough to mask
the action.
And what action it is.
Crilly’s ear for dialogue
is matched by an eye for
character, all complex, all
broken, all believable. The
men range from pitiful
to malicious. Crilly isn’t
making a misanthropic
argument: rather, he’s
invested in dismantling
mythologies and abstrac-
tions, the blushing portrait
of the freedom fighter, of
the cause. War’s always
been a man’s game, and
if it reflects an innate
sensibility for violence,
it also reflects a need for
ego-swelling, for a sense
of importance. Fra Maline
can’t talk to his family
and drinks enough units
to put away a horse before
breakfast. However, in
his eyes he’s an unresting
freedom fighter, ready
to liberate the North at a
moment’s notice - never
mind that he got shot
in the leg on his first
mission, or that he’s too
busy hiding a gay affair
to topple an autocratic
British client state. Fra is
merely pathetic: another
volunteer makes the
point of war’s cruelty, its
callousness, much more
starkly. Of course, this
isn’t anti-republicanism
so much as anti-sectari-
anism – anti-murdering
people on their way to do
the shopping, anti-wiping
your hands of your own
crimes. It’s the women of
the play who must bear
the brunt of the pain the
self-absorption of mythol-
ogizing entails, but Crilly
also gives them the grace
to be flawed on their own
merits. They are people,
and against the pettiness
of the men it is their
traumas and desperate
hopes that linger behind
the last bow.
Now, the play’s not a
total success: in a final act
that veers close to melo-
drama, the play takes the
possibility of rural incest
too seriously for its own
good (for those who’ve
missed the wasteful
violence, county Antrim
scenery and shoelace-knot
family trees of Game of
Thrones, this might be
one to catch). But Crilly’s
writing always outpaces
his machinations; for
anyone wanting a look at a
period too often buried in
memory, you’ll find some
rewarding views across
the Irish sea on McQuil-
lan’s hill indeed.
