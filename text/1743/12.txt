Rough for Theatre II/
Endgame
LoveSexIdentityAmbition
N
ever in my life
as a theatrego-
er have I felt
so taken aback
by a fellow audience
member as I did when
watching this double-bill
production of two texts by
the acclaimed playwright
Samuel Beckett. All
throughout the two and a
half hour run, the gentle-
man who sat behind me
kept bursting in enormous
fits of laughter, erupting
with joy, occasionally
without much accompani-
ment from the rest of the
audience. Not only did
I keep getting startled
by his louder-than-the-
actors presence, I was
also confused as I did not
find either of the plays
funny, or even remotely
interesting.
The performance
started with Rough for
Theatre II, a short play
originally written in
French and translated
into English by Beckett
himself. It follows two
men, who might be of
this world or not, as
they discuss the life of a
third man who is about
to jump out of a window
on the sixth floor of a
building somewhere. I
know this sounds vague,
but honestly, there really
wasn’t much more to it.
No real plot develop-
ment, and no conclusion.
However, my biggest
gripe with Rough for
Theatre II is the fact that
it was simply tagged
along to the beginning of
Endgame, without much
purpose or any connection
between the two plays.
Following an interval
almost as long as Rough
for Theatre II itself came
Endgame, which is widely
considered to be one of
Beckett’s finest works.
It’s a play where once
again, not much happens,
and there’s too much
talking. Perhaps this was
intentional, an attempt to
portray the monotony of
life, especially for those
under less fortunate cir-
cumstances. However, as
a viewer, this was neither
satisfying nor entertain-
ing.
Both plays star Alan
Cumming and Daniel
Radcliffe, who do a com-
mendable job carrying
the verbose, emotionless
scripts through the finish
line. The direction by
Richard Jones is slick,
however, the reliance
on physical comedy (for
example, Radcliffe re-
peatedly slapping himself)
looked cheap, and did not
add much to an already
bleak script.
Needless to say, I
left the Old Vic grossly
unimpressed. Given the
calibre of talent both on
and off-stage, I expected
to be entertained, if
nothing else. Instead, all
I could think of was how
I’d much rather be doing
almost anything else.
L
oveSexIdentit-
yAmbition is a
5 day long show
consisting of 4
actresses performing 16
monologuesfromthebook
Hear Me Now by Titilola
Dawudu and Tamasha.
Each monologue belongs
to one of the four catego-
ries: Love, Sex, Identity,
and Ambition, telling
stories concerning women
of colour.
The act began with
Koko Brown, a humorous
host who touched on the
topics mentioned in the
a colorful scarf which
became their main prop.
‘Going to Paris’ per-
formed by Safiyya Ingar
was definitely a stand out
piece. The monologue
brought up the topic of
social inequality in a very
cheerful and optimistic
style. It compared the
opposite attitudes between
the monologist and her
saddening to understand
how actions such as being
treated with respect were
out of the ordinary for her.
After her lengthy speech,
there was a heartbreaking
and anticlimactic ending
where she realised he had
been asleep the whole
time.
‘The N Word’ was also
a well-acted performance
by Chinwen Nwokolo.
Taking place in a bar
where a girl was supposed
to go on stage to perform
a song, the monologue is
given by her sister in the
audience. Despite the per-
formers being forbidden
to use the N word, the
girl insists it is a way of
self-expression. In order
to avoid the girl getting
into trouble, her sister
talks to the organiser and
decides to perform instead

A show that puts a spotlight on taboo subjects
“The
monologue
brought up the
topic of social
inequality in a
very cheerful
and optimistic
style”
title of the show making
us reflect on what they
meant to us. After a
playful introduction the
performance started. The
actresses walked simulta-
neously on stage, consist-
ing of only four blocks,
and remained there during
all the monologues. This
minimalistic setting was
matched by the outfits of
the girls: all black with
“With
tender and
affectionate
words she
described her
excessively
intense
emotions
to her
“sweetheart””
friend who both dreamed
of living in Paris. In the
monologue, the girl who
turned to stripping on
camera tried to convince
her friend to also believe
they deserved to be where
they wanted to be and
had to fight for it. The
acting was particularly
impressive since besides
missing the words of the
friend, Safiyya managed
to make it seem as if we
were listening to the full
conversation between
them.
Another outstanding
monologue was ‘REKHA’
performed by Adele Oni.
It portrayed an after-sex
scene of a woman who
had fallen in love during
the previous night. With
tender and affectionate
words she described
her excessively intense
emotions to her “sweet-
heart”. Although treated
in a comical way, it was
“In essence,
LoveSexIden-
tityAmbition
focuses on
women of
colour”
of her. We could picture
the setting, alongside all
the side characters, as
Chinwen switched her
attention to different parts
of the stage to imitate
interactions and conver-
sations with different
people.
In essence, LoveSex-
IdentiyAmbition focuses
on women of colour but
the performance can be
enjoyable and interesting
to a wider audience for
its important message,
original structure, and
good acting. A great
varied show to open your
mind by bringing atten-
tion to crucial topics in a
unique style.
