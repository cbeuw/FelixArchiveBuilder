A
brand-new year
means a brand-
new set of
iconic albums
turning 50, and this week
is no different as Felix
looks back at the seminal,
eponymously entitled
album, Black Sabbath.
When first released, this
album received critical
reviews yet commercial
success, and has gone on
to be hailed as the birth
of heavy metal. But why
did critics rebuke Black
Sabbath’s first attempt,
and if they’re right, how
did it propel the band to
the fame they encounter
today?
To answer these, we
need some background.
Black Sabbath were
formed from an amal-
gamation of two failing
Brummie bands in 1968,
after guitarist Tony Iommi
and drummer Bill Ward
got in contact with singer
Ozzy Osbourne through
his ad, stating “OZZY
ZIG Needs Gig – has own
PA”. The magical words
marking the beginning
of metal itself. Osbourne
brought along his old
bandmate, bassist Geezer
Butler, and together the
four were rebirthed as
Black Sabbath, with a
few stints as The Polka
Tulk Blues Band and
Earth in between. In these
early days, the group
mainly played old-school
blues and jazz, with a
brief stint in Jethro Tull
shaping Iommi’s style in
early 1969. This can still
be heard in their later
albums as well as in Black
Sabbath. Soon after the
group were picking up
gigs and being peddled in
front of record labels in
an attempt to be signed.
This wasn’t successful.
Instead they were told
to play pop, with Butler
saying “They just didn’t
get it. So they tried to
make us a pop band”.
Osbourne made it overtly
clear as well: “Sabbath
don’t write fucking hit
singles”. Despite this,
when Sabbath hit the
studio in November
1969, they recorded their
regular setlist including
the pop-ier cover of
‘Evil Woman’ by Crow.
Allegedly this took about
12 hours to record, and
they were done in time
for last orders. In January
1970, the record label
Philips took an interest
“Commercial
and critical
success
seemed to
differ due
to Sabbath’s
mysticism”
“Bended and
discordant
chords paired
up with
Osbourne’s
voice.”
and released Sabbath’s
take on a pop song ‘Evil
Woman’; despite the
single not charting, the
next month, Friday 13th
February, they release the
entire album on Philips’
more progressive label,
Fontana.
Black Sabbath hit the
charts, reaching number 8
in the UK and eventually
reaching 23 in the States
when it was released
later that year. However,
Rolling Stone described
the album as having
“nothing to do with...
anything much except
stiff recitations of Cream
clichés that sound like the
musicians learned them
out of a book”. Big oof.
Yet critically the album
doesn’t line up with its
commercial worth. This
isn’t massively saying
much: critics can defi-
nitely be wrong (Rolling
Stone have admitted
they panned a few now
legendary albums, such as
Led Zeppelin I and Never-
mind), and the charts can
really, really be wrong as
well at the best of times.
Ultimately though the
commercial and critical
response given to the
album seemed to differ
due to the mysticism sur-
rounding Black Sabbath
at the time. Firstly, their
name, taken from Boris
Karloff’s 1963 film of the
same name was intended
to get people intrigued,
with Butler’s logic at the
time being “it was strange
so many people spend so
much money to see scary
movies”. The title track
‘Black Sabbath’ kicks off
the album with Black Sab-
bath’s now signature mix
of suspenseful, doomy
noise which was at the
time a new kind of sound
from a band in the charts.
The dread-filled songs,
now a Sabbath signature,
first came from this song,
based upon a dream that
Butler had where he saw
an apparition standing
at the foot of his bed.
Upon telling the rest of
his bandmates, Osbourne
wrote the ominous lyrics
“What is this that stands
before me?//Figure in
black which points at me”.
This was accompanied
by Iommi’s distinctive
discordant riff, apparent-
ly dubbed the “devil’s
tritone” by classical
music. Nowadays Butler
finds amusement in this
origin story, explaining
“I always had...psychic
experiences. That was
one of the very last ones
I had...that was before I
did drugs, by the way.”.
Sabbath, not doing drugs?
Sounds spooky to me too.
Thanks to this song
style, word got around
that Black Sabbath were
Satanists, probably not
helped by other lyrics such
as “my name is Lucifer,
please take my hand” in
the song N.I.B. and the
enchanting tale found in
the song ‘The Wizard’.
Sabbath’s label played
up to this, packaging the
album up with an eerie
cloaked figure on a pink-
hued front cover, standing
in the foreground of a
church. The inner sleeve
featured an inverted
cross and a dark poem
within it. These rumours
were further fuelled by
the album release in the
States which is rumoured
to have been launched by
Anton Lavey, the head
of the Church of Satan.
Potentially, the juxtaposi-
tion between critical and
commercial success of
this album may have been
down to this hype around
the “Satanist” band: con-
sumers wanted to know
what it was about, whereas
critics may have expected
more from what is realisti-
cally Sabbath’s blues-iest
album. However, saying
this does not mean Black
Sabbath should not get
the credit it deserves as
one of the first heavy
metal albums. Nearly all
of the other songs on the
album featured Iommi’s
guitar style heavily, char-
acteristic to him because
of his adapted playing to
incorporate his plastic-fin-
gertips, and it was these
slowed down, bended
and discordant chords
combined with Osbourne
distinctive voice which
pushed the band in the
heavy direction. In the end
it was these two quirks of
the band, along with their
blues background, which
evolved their sound into
the beginnings of a new
genre.
