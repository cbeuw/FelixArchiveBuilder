Imperial Staff to Strike in February and March
NEWS
Henry Alman
Editor-in-Chief
A
cademic staff
at the College
have voted to
go on strike
in response to the on-
going national pension
negotiations, as well as
a local pay dispute with
the College itself.
There are fourteen
planned strike days across
the span of four weeks,
from Thursday 20th
February to Friday 13th
March. The final week,
from 9th to 13th March,
is a full strike week.
Participating staff will not
attend work – meaning
their research, teaching,
and administrative work
will not be fulfilled.
The action follows on
from the University and
College Union (UCU)
strikes conducted towards
the end of last year –
which the Imperial UCU
could not participate in
due to an under-50%
turnout in earlier strike
ballots – and the strikes
two years ago, which re-
sulted in cancelled contact
time for Imperial students,
as well as causing certain
exams to be rewritten to
accommodate for content
that had not been taught.
The national pensions
dispute centres around the
University Superannua-
tion Scheme (USS) – the
pension scheme on which
most university staff are
enrolled – increasing its
required contributions
for both employees and
employers. This is in re-
action to an internal USS
assessment of the value of
its fund, which it decided
was in deficit. However,
other parties have disput-
ed this valuation and its
methodology – such as the
Joint Expert Panel.
The strikes in 2018
resulted in the establish-
ment of a Joint Expert
Panel (JEP) comprised of
UCU and university em-
ployers’ representatives
– which was the primary
reason for ending the last
round of action. The UCU
feels that the JEP findings
have been overruled by
the USS executive, with
two pension contribution
increases already imposed
and another planned in the
next 18 months, resulting
in staff having to pay an
additional 38% in contri-
butions. This has resulted
in a sense of “betrayal”
amongst university staff
according to the Imperial
UCU.
The Imperial UCU
thus voted to join national
out at the same time as
the pension ballot, had a
turnout of 56.4%, with
67.9% voting for strike
action and 84.2% for
‘action short of a strike’.
The Imperial UCU is
therefore rolling this
issue together with their
from the College man-
agement rejected by the
Joint Trade Unions at the
College (which represent
all staff at Imperial).
The news of the strikes
over both pay and pen-
sions broke shortly after
the Independent revealed
that Alice Gast, Imperial
College’s President, has
the highest salary of any
university head in the
UK, at £554,000 – a full
£63,000 above the sec-
ond-highest at LSE.
Part of this is because
she has opted out of the
same pension which is
currently under national
fire, and receives both her
own employee contribu-
tion and the College’s em-
ployer contribution as part
of her salary, according
to the College’s 2018-19
Annual Report. Her with-
drawal from the pension
scheme essentially under-
mines it and exacerbates
the USS’ claimed fund
deficit – if high earners
do not contribute their
equivalently large pension
input, then it essentially
increases the perceived
deficit.
Michael McGarvey, the
head of the Imperial staff
union (Imperial UCU),
said:
“We have a grim
determination to resolve
these disputes properly.
We don’t take this action
lightly – the impact on
students is the greatest
concern we had when
voting. Students and
their education are often
used as hostages in these
situations, with blame
apportioned to striking
staff. However, not taking
action about pay and
pensions affects students
in the long-run; if people
are disillusioned with
working at universities,
we can’t recruit and keep
world-class staff.
“We’ve still had no
direct contact over the pay
dispute from the College
management, despite our
offer to meet with them
over a week ago.”
The College, mean-
while, has sent out all-staff
and all-student emails and
published FAQs. In the
former, they expressed
“disappointment” that the
national UCU had decided
to strike, and regarding
the local pay dispute as-
serted that they had local
pay rates “amongst the
best in the UK sector.” In
the FAQs, they clarified
that – just as two years
ago – no reimbursement
for tuition fees would be
offered, regardless of any
potential rescheduling
or missed content. Any
staff salaries lost due to
striking will, however, be
held in a central fund to be
redistributed and fed back
into student education.
