My Heart is an Open (Text)Book…
…and now scientists are thumbing through it for new insights into health than we’ve ever known.

A
re our hearts
o v e r r a t e d ?
They seemed
to be, at least,
until recently; our ability
to interpret our heart rate
as an indicator of health
issues was restricted to a
comparison against the
population average of 60
to 100 beats per minute
(bpm).
Now, scientists at
the Scripps Research
Translational Institute
have taken advantage of
the growing trend towards
individual monitoring of
healthcare data – the rise
of the ‘quantified self’ –
and have analysed heart
rate data recorded by
Fitbits from across the
United States of America.
Spanning two years,
involving nearly 100,000
people, and totalling over
32 million days’ worth
of data, the scope of this
study, recently published
in PLOS ONE, is huge.
Resting heart rates
are usually taken as an
isolated data point and
compared against the pop-
ulation average. But the
data collected in this study
over a longer timeframe
(known as longitudinal
data) allows for a more
nuanced understanding of
intra- and inter-individual
differences.
Dr Giorgio Quer, part
of the research team, con-
siders this a rich source
of information; obtaining
longitudinal data not only
allows individuals to
have an insight into their
own health parameters,
but when collated across
populations, it can help
scientists to refine their
understanding of diseases,
support earlier diagnoses,
spot infections quicker,
or eventually, determine
the effects of longer-term
factors such as environ-
mental changes.
He describes one of
their major findings on in-
ter-individual differences.
“It was exciting to observe
that the resting heart rate
of different individuals
varies widely – what is
normal for you, may be
unusual for someone else,
and suggest an illness.”
The team found that our
heart rate can actually
vary by up to 70 bpm from
person to person, from as
low as 40 to as high as 109
bpm.
But, surprisingly, age
and sex, two common
culprits for population
differences, were only
minimally associated with
this difference. Resting
heart rate was found to
vary according to age
(increasing to the age of
50, then declining with
advancing age) and sex
(women’s heart rates
were, on average, 2-3 bpm
higher than men’s), but
together, they accounted
for only 6% of this var-
iation. Even when the
team included Body Mass
Index (BMI) and sleep du-
ration, no more than 10%
of the difference could be
explained.
Intra-individual var-
iations also uncovered
intriguing findings. The
greatest variability in any
individual data was found
in women of child-bearing
age,whichDrQuerandthe
team believe could help
support our understanding
of reproductive health.
In fact, current fertility
applications incorporate
resting heart rate
data to help iden-
tify stages of the
menstrual cycle.
“Wealsofound
a surprising sea-
sonal variation
in heart rate that
was lowest in
July, and peaked
after the holidays
at the end of the
year.”
The team spec-
ulate this may be
due to changing
exercise habits

A
lzheimer’s
disease (AD) is
the most prev-
alent form of
dementia, characterised
by a progressive decline
of cognitive skills, asso-
ciated with a build-up of
toxic amyloid molecules
forming plaques, and an
increase in the activat-
ed form of tau protein.
Changes in specific brain
patterns, called gamma
brainwaves, have now
been linked to AD.
Researchers from
MIT found that artificial
induction of these gam-
ma brainwaves, which
Gamma Brainwaves: Hoax or New Therapeutic
Avenue?
have a frequency of
~40Hz, by sound, as well
as combined light and
sound stimuli, decreased
negative pathological
features of AD, such as
amyloid build-up, while
simultaneously increasing
the presence of microglia,
the brain’s immune cells,
in mice models. An im-
provement in the region
responsible for memory
consolidation and spatial
memory was also ob-
served.
Previously, the team
demonstrated that light
flickering at 40Hz was
able to artificially induce
gamma brainwaves in
mice, which reduced the
amount of amyloid while
increasing the amount
of microglia within the
brain. Now, the authors
tested whether these
brainwaves can also be
induced by sound stim-
ulation. In addition to
improvement of memory
consolidation and spatial
memory, a drop in amy-
loid levels and amyloid
plaques was seen within
various brain regions.
Microglia, which are
responsible for amyloid
clearance, increased in
both number and size,
and co-localised with
amyloid within the brain,
suggesting increased
amyloid uptake. A larger
blood vessel diameter
in the brain was also
observed; since amyloid
clearance can also occur
via blood vessels, this
suggests more potential
for waste clearance.
Next, the researchers
tested the combination of
light and sound stimula-
tion together, which again
successfully resulted
in induction of gamma
brainwaves in multiple
brain regions. Amyloid
levels were reduced,
while microglia increased
– the same as with
sound stimulation alone.
However, the combined
stimuli also increased the
number of microglia per
plaque, and the microglia
surrounded the amyloid
deposits, rather than sim-
ply being present nearby.
These effects occurred
not just in the brain
regions specific to visual
and auditory responses,
but also in brain areas re-
sponsible for higher-order
brain functions, in par-
ticular short-term memo-
ry and executive function
– importantly, effects here
were not seen with either
stimulus alone.
The question that re-
mains is how these effects
occur: are the combined
effects a result of one
stimulus influencing
the other, or simply an
addition of both bene-
fits? Lead author Chin-
nakkaruppan Adaikkan
stated, “While we know it
affects pathology in mice,
we want to understand
how because that will
help us understand and
refine potential treat-
ment.”
Simple light or sound
stimulation can induce
effects in multiple cell
types and different brain
areas, decreasing the
harmful features of AD
and improving brain
function in genetical-
ly engineered mouse
models. This is even
more widespread when
both stimulation types are
combined, highlighting
the potential of something
so simple to treat a very
complex disease. Howev-
er, further research is re-
quired to understand how
this artificial stimulation
can be related to naturally
occurring brainwaves,
and whether this could be
extended to humans.
But, while it might
not be transferrable for
human AD treatment
anytime soon, listening
to those gamma wave-in-
ducing Spotify playlists
surely can’t hurt.
