Yummy isn’t painfully mediocre, it’s fantastically
stupid
After a brief hiatus Bieber returned with a critical flop, but maybe there’s something special hidden amongst the
wreckage.

ustin Bieber is no
stranger to a bit
of controversy.
Growing up is hard
enough, let alone doing it
with millions of eyes fixed
on you. Be honest, we’ve
all hit a paparazzi with our
car or been blacklisted by
the Chinese government,
but imagine how much
harder that is to deal with
when people are also
starting petitions to have
you removed from your
county. Considering our
boy Justin stepped into the
limelight over a decade
ago he’s certainly proven
his stamina for a public
bashing. All that’s in the
past now though. Bieber
took a hiatus at the be-
ginning of last year, now
he’s getting married…
Justin Bieber who? Barely
recognisable.
If his marketing team
are pushing an image of
a more mature Bieber
that’s fine, no qualms with
that it’s about time. We’d
believe them if this wasn’t
the seventeenth time
they’ve tried this strategy.
Though, heads will turn
if you start using scuzzy
tactics to get your new
single to number one.
‘Surreal’ is an un-
derstatement when you
go through the list of
things the Bieber team
has been doing to try and
get “Yummy” to number
one. Seven videos for
“Yummy” were released
“This
concoction of
complete fuck-
upery that has
won me over”
on youtube: official, lyric,
fan lip sync, beliebers
react, animated, food
fight, and yet another
animated video. Why?
Because Billboard counts
all those views as streams.
On an Instagram post
Bieber asked fans to put
the song on repeat while
they sleep, buy the song
regardless of streaming
services already used and
even purchase a VPN so
that they could stream the
song onAmerican servers.
The peak of this fever
dream was when Bieber
randomly started posting
photos of unknown babies
on his Instagram with the
caption “#yummy”. The
amount of other dumb
shit they did could fill
this page, but you can just
look it up if you’re still
interested. Needless to
say, the music community
was quick to lampoon this
con.
“Yummy” only made it
to number two in the end,
oof.
The song is bad that’s
why. All around poor
choices were made and
yet I can’t help but love
all of it so very much. The
satisfaction is similar to
watching the video of Post
Malone’s crowd surfing
fail or Travis Scott falling
off stage in autotune.
Team Bieber gave them-
selves a big ol’ wedgie.
There’s a fantastic
song by the comedian Bo
Burnham called “Repeat
Stuff” that takes the piss
out of the music industry’s
approach to writing songs.
He points out that music
from One Direction, Justin
Bieber, Usher and many
others is written to be as
vague as possible so that
anyone can think the song
is about themselves. The
same thing has happened
with “Yummy” and it’s so
ridiculous that it’s almost
become self-parody. The
first song released about
Bieber’s wife, Hailey
Baldwin, is one of his
vaguest and stupidest
songs to date.
It isn’t just music
critics with their heads up
their own asses that think
this either. The general re-
ception from most is that
Biebers return has been
painfully mediocre.
The obvious blunder is
the use of “yummy” as a
sexy word, which it isn’t.
Also, using “yummy” like
that makes the posting
of baby pictures with the
caption “#Yummy” a lot
creepier. Lyrically the
song lacks any substance
and there are a couple
weird choices like when
Bieber calls Hailey a
“Bona fide stallion” …
which is the male horse.
The song has six writing
credits, yes, it took six
people to write this song.
Did no one proofread this
thing? Did all six of these
“professionals” think this
was an appropriate song
for a man to sing about his
wife? I just hope Bieber
didn’t hire them to help
write his vows.
YouTube commen-
tary comedian Danny
Gonzalez covered this
beautiful car crash of a
single release and made
a parody song. Honestly,
on a technical level the
parody song has better
lyrics.
The production
elements on “Yummy”
are all tight. Beliebers
definitely aren’t tuning
in for new experimental
stuff but the instrumental
is surprisingly basic - a
palatable summer chill
beat that anyone could
groove to. Everything in
this song has been done
before. There’s not much
else to say, it’s a very
simple song.
The sum of all the
musical missteps and pro-
motion scandals makes
“Yummy” one of Biebers
worst songs to date, and
it’s this concoction of
complete fuck-upery
that has won me over. A
bit of dumb fun that no
one is taking seriously.
Something special about
that. So, I stand with the
die-hard Beliebers on this
one. It may not have made
it to #1 on the charts but
“Yummy” is #1 in my
heart.
