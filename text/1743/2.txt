Do the Best Candidates Actually
Run?
T
he Leadership
Elections 2020
(LE20) at the
Union have
kicked off now, with nom-
inations opening between
now and the end of the
month. A week of feverish
campaigning will follow,
before voting opens be-
tween the 9th and 12th of
March. Events like Meet
the Candidates – a live-
streamed debate between
contenders for major
roles – will help students
make those tough choices
where manifestos fail to
convince.
The Imperial elections
have, by and large, been
successful events every
year. While criticism can
be levied – see this week’s
Comment section – there
is no denying that the
Union does excel at this
task at this time every
single year.
Many roles are hotly
contested, and the elec-
tions drama gives the
entire university commu-
nity a welcome distraction
from the looming dread
of exams just around the
corner.
So, there’s plenty of
support and plenty of
coverage for the candi-
dates that do run. You can
make your own choice
for who the best of those
is. What you can’t do,
of course, is vote for
someone that didn’t run.
The question that natu-
rally arises for me is: well,
how do I know the best
candidate actually ran?
When do I vote for good
ol’ Ronald? Or, as he’s
more commonly known,
RON – or to Reopen
Nominations.
I’m not convinced that
a lot of the best candidates
actually end up running.
You can, of course, argue
that the best candidates
are the ones who want
to be there, and anybody
else would inherently be a
waste of time. But I think,
taking my premise as true,
that we should be asking
ourselves why the best
candidates don’t want to
be there.
The optimal people
to bring into each role
would be experienced
Union volunteers. They
are the people who have
the most insight, the
most experience, the
most inside knowledge,
the most connections and
relationships within the
Union and College com-
munity. They’re the ones
who actually know how
things work, and can hit
the ground sprinting when
they start their roles.
A lot of those senior
volunteers do run. I expect
this year’s nominations to
include a range of people
with a boatload of expe-
rience. It’s the wayward
children, so to speak, that
we need to focus on – the
boatloads of experience
that leave, vanish, flushed
down the drain and lost to
the community forever.
Those that do not run
for Sab roles at the end
of their degrees, or who
don’t run for Faculty Rep
after succeeding as Dep
Rep, and so on, despite
being extremely highly
qualified.
I do think a lot of these
people don’t run for good
reasons. Some have no
interest in postponing
their careers, for example.
We are a highly career-fo-
cused university, so this
is understandable. More
power to them.
So what worries me,
really, is the selection
of people who don’t run
because they’re sick to
the back teeth of… well,
everything. There are a
boatload of them, too. I’ve
spoken to a bunch of them
this year, investigating
various stories, and it’s
a growing litany. They
are the people who’ve
been in the Union system
since their very first term,
who’ve fought through
issues like staff vacancies,
delayed contracts, im-
possible room bookings,
bureaucracy, whatever it
might be.
What any of them end
up feeling is not invigor-
ated and motivated. They
end up tired, and turning
their back on the institu-
tion that should be doing
everything it can to retain
them. They’ve often been
used up before they got to
a place where they could
instigate real, drastic
changes.
This isn’t universal –
my intention is really not
to cast shade on those
running this year, or in
previous years. Plenty of
them were the best can-
didates. It’s just that there
are undoubtedly good
people we lose every year
to fatigue and frustration,
rather than for any accept-
able reason.
I think this should
be the Union’s greatest
focus – it grows stronger
by building a strong,
long-lasting community
of volunteers who want
to stick around, become
Sabs, join as staff
members, and so on. To do
so should not be an ordeal,
but rather a genuinely
coveted and competitive
opportunity.
This is more important
than the election facts and
figures. Having someone
in a role is superseded by
having the right person in
the role. While they are
impressive, the Union
needs to square this great
strength with one of its
greatest weaknesses –
retention, of staff and es-
pecially of dedicated and
knowledgeable students.
Once they’ve achieved
that, their upwards
momentum will rocket.
