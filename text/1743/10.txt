Lost Laowais
A
midst the
tide of rising
anti-East Asian
sentiment and
Brexit-related racism,
David East’s ‘Lost
Laowais’ offers a timely
perspective into the nu-
anced aspects of cultural
assimilation through the
experience of British
emigrants in China.
‘Laowai’, translating
literally to ‘old outside’,
is the common Mandarin
term for a foreigner. The
play was performed by
members of Eschaton
Theatre, founded late last
year with the vision of
making theatre for ‘the
end of the world’. Whilst
not quite armageddon, the
play certainly addresses
issues that are rarely
touched upon: Anglo-Chi-
nese relations, cultural
assimilation, and heritage.
Despite the play being
set entirely in China, we
only see Chinese culture
through the eyes of out-
siders: the 20-something
looking to find himself,
the third-generation im-
migrant looking for her
heritage, the weary expat
suffering from yellow
fever, and the rich diplo-
mat’s son. Our only clue
into what life is really
like for a Beijing local
are quips from Siu-See
Hung’s character, includ-
ing a poignant moment
where she reminds Julian,
the male lead, that he
is paid more than his
Chinese co-workers for
no other reason than his
British passport.
Julian, played by East
himself, is introduced as
an arrogant westerner who
quickly grows uncomfort-
able and defensive when
reminded of his identity,
or lack thereof.
The imperialism of
Western culture makes
Julian’s whiteness a visa,
giving him the stamp of
‘normal’ wherever he
goes, including Beijing.
When questioned ‘Why
China?’, he does not have
a better reason than cheap
dumplings, reducing a
complex culture down
to palatable, bite-sized
pieces. This feels particu-
larly sour in comparison
to Lisa, a character of
Chinese descent, whose
parents prioritised
assimilation into UK
culture over teaching her
Mandarin. She doesn’t
have the luxury of picking
and choosing parts of her
culture; her ‘otherness’ in
both the UK and China
isolates her in a way Julian
will never understand.
Hung’s role as Lisa is
an ode to the diaspora of
immigrant children. Her
character experiences
difficulties that are sure
to resonate with those
of mixed heritage in the
audience: estrangement,
identity policing, and an
inability to communicate
in one’s mother tongue.
The difficulty in being
caught between two
cultures was captured per-
fectly in a scene where a
waitress’ friendly camara-
derie was cut short when
she realised Lisa couldn’t
speak Mandarin.
Acclaimed poet Xu Zhi
Mo’s ‘Saying Goodbye
to Cambridge Again’ was
a recurring motif in the
play:
‘Quietly I left,
As quietly as I
came.’
The poem reflects on
the freedom and mobility
of wealthier Western
expats and captures
Roberts story arc aptly.
Robert, an expat, marries
a Chinese woman who
barely speaks English
before beginning a stilted
romance with Lisa.
Robert is 1 of 3
main characters who
is associated with the
university of Cambridge,
undoubtedly a reference
to the insurmountable
pressure on Chinese youth
to excel academically.
This is seen most clearly
in Ollie’s story arc, who
is humorously dubbed
as a ‘diplo-brat’ epito-
mising China’s elite. His
deep-rooted issues with
loneliness and inadequa-
cy is an homage to the
age-old saying ‘money
can’t buy happiness’.
Despite these artistic
undertones, it was clearly
an amateur production,
with dropped lines, inco-
herent transitions and at
times unnatural scenes.
East had the herculean
task of exploring the
complexities of cultural
identity in a 60 minute
runtime, which made
certain aspects feel
rushed. Whilst there were
clear attempts to flesh out
the characters, at times
it felt like a whistle-stop
tour; briefly mentioning
but not expanding on
how characters dealt with
abandonment, infidelity,
and sexuality. Much of
the humour was related
to the life of expats in
China, and is unlikely to
be accessible to people
who haven’t experienced
life in China, or who don’t
speak Mandarin.
Overall, East’s produc-
tion captured the inexpli-
cable feelings of cultural
insecurity well, and we left
the theatre contemplating
whether second-gen-
eration immigrants are
indeed lucky to have the
‘best of both worlds’. One
of the greatest advantages
of studying at Imperial
is its location: London,
the cultural capital of the
UK. Yet, one wonders at
the end of this play, for
immigrants to accommo-
date British identity, how
much of their heritage is
lost?
