A
fter causing
an upset on
Oxford’s home
turf at their
Town vs. Gown event
last month, Imperial
College Boxing Club
were looking to continue
their run of form at the
annual BUCS boxing
national championships.
For only the second time
in the club’s history, IC
Boxing Club put forward
its best boxers to do
battle with the toughest
university competitors-
from across the UK. Two
fearless Imperial boxers
took on the challenge
and made the journey
to the Wolverhampton
University venue on the
31st January.
The championships are
“Amy charged
out of her
corner to
make sure she
landed the first
punch of the
quarter final”
“Coach Shakey
urged his
boxer to‘stop
playing with
her food’and
go for the
knockout”
were three of the best
coaches in the business,
drawing on over a century
of boxing experience:
former GB Olympic team
coach George Burton,
former London amateur
boxing captain Franky
‘Fingers’ Finn and star
coach ‘Shakey’ Shaheed
Fontaine. Over the past 4
months each has passed
on their boxing wisdom to
give Amy the edge in the
ring, perfecting the art of
‘hit and don’t get hit’.
Seconds out…Round
1! Amy charged out of her
corner to make sure she
landedthefirstpunchofthe
quarter final. Being much
taller than her opponent,
as well as adopting a
southpaw fighting style
(meaning she boxes right
hand forward with a left
hand power shot), made
Amy an awkward target.
The Hammer used her
superior reach and slick
body movement to evade
the Brunel boxer for the
whole bout, all the time
managing to land fast
jabs before following
up with devastating
backhand power punches.
Always hypercritical
and seeking perfection
from their boxers, the
coaches gave Amy some
pre-semifinal advice to
tighten-up any weakness-
es she showed from her
first bout. Coach Shakey
urged his boxer to ‘stop
playing with her food’
and go for the knockout.
This was good advice.
The semi-final started in
similar fashion with Amy
dominating from the start.
Her shorter adversary
charged out the corner,
hoping to get on the inside
of Amy’s long reach, but
the Imperial boxer was too
clever and hit back. Hard.
The barrage of punches
that followed were to
connect flush with the face
of the opponent, forcing a
quick intervention from
the referee who called a
‘standing 8’ count. Upon
recommencing the bout,
Amy pounced again.
