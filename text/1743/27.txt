F
or decades, it has
been observed
that there is a
spike in male
homosexual intercourse
in the days leading up
to Valentine’s. While
multiple theories have
been posited, none have
gained as much traction
as that of men sleeping
with other men to prove
that they can still have
fun and be mad lads
even after getting into a
relationship.
Men entering into
heterosexual relation-
ships are often given the
toxic stereotype of being
BoRiNg and never being
WiLLiNg tO cOmE oUt
fOr a PiNt. But this is
often untrue, and men
have taken to the sheets
to prove the unwavering
strength of their inner
hard man.
Hearing that these men
are giving each other
brojobs and sleeping with
other men, you might
be thinking, ‘wait, this
sounds kinda gay’, but
you are dearly mistaken.
The men participating in
this ritual insist that they
are straight; they have
girlfriends, after all.
When asked if whether
he was a closet homosex-
ual or bisexual, a source
tells us, “Well it obviously
wasn’t gay because we
never made eye contact.
Granted he was nailing
me whilst I was pinned
against the wall, his hot
breath against my ear
and our hearts beating
in perfect synchronicity,
and… Well anyways we
never made eye contact.
So it wasn’t gay. I’m
fucking straight bro.”
Sen Febton, who lec-
tures a course at Impenis
College London on what
constitutes homosexual
sex, conﬁrms this: “It’s
true, it’s not gay if you
don’t make eye contact.
And doesn’t count if you
wear socks. And, studies
show that if it doesn’t
count either if it’s a three
way, even if it’s three
men.”
Another brave fellow
testiﬁed to the reliability
of these cardinal rules:
“One year, I almost forgot
to say “no homo” but
thank god I remembered
at the very last minute,
right before he left my
ﬂat the morning after. My
girlfriend would be so
mad if she found out I was
having gay sex, but yea
that was a real close one.”
