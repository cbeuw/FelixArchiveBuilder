Gwyneth Paltrow, Class of Imperial College 2020
Can the actress-turned-lifestyle-guru conquer streaming while plugging her brand?

A
brand that
positions itself
as aspirational
is monetising
the fact that it makes
you feel somewhat in-
adequate. How else can
you see yourself, when
faced with a woman such
as Gwyneth Paltrow,
actress-turned-entre-
preneur, who has had
herself stung by bees
to maintain a youthful
complexion. Goop, the
company she started as an
online newsletter offering
lifestyle tips to fans,
has since expanded to a
multimedia conglomerate.
Today, there is an e-shop,
an annual conference,
a magazine and, as of
January 2020, a Netflix
documentary series. In
the opening of Goop
Lab, which explores the
frontiers of wellness
culture, Paltrow describes
her motivation as a desire
for more from life than
making out with Matt
Damon, a top contender
for my favourite humble
brag of 2020. She finds
this higher purpose in the
“optimisation of the self”
and an unending drive
towards experimentation.
Each episode typically
focuses on Paltrow and a
group of company staffers
exploring a strand of
wellness and health, from
well-trotted topics like
dieting and sex to zanier
ones like mediumship and
energy channelling. To
stretch the term beyond
what is healthy at a
STEM university, there is
something of a scientific
method to Goop Lab’s
approach and this forms
the structure for each
episode. We typically
begin with a discussion
with one of several
experts who are featured
throughout the show,
where they outline their
credentials, goals, and
introduce acclamatory
testimonials from people
they worked with. These
treatments are then tested
by company employees,
who are all beautiful, but
not to an extent that is
unreachable if only you
worked on yourself more
or finally purchased some
Goop products.
Gwyneth Paltrow at one
point jokingly calls herself
the ultimate Guinea Pig,
although it is usually her
staff and the experts who
try the more unconven-
tional treatments, whether
it is drinking psilocybin
tea or being taught how
to masturbate while taped.
As in ‘regular’ science,
most of the trials are done
in large groups, beyond
just the few individuals
whose testimonials will
end up on camera. This is
“It was jarring
to watch a
woman work
through life-
long anxiety
issues with
something as
comparatively
banal as
working out in
the snow”
“When first
describing
the show
to friends,
they had
already begun
proposing
drinking
games to play”
likely in part an attempt to
highlight more clothing
from the company, but it
gives the series a sense
of community that it
wouldn’t have if it only
focused on Paltrow. The
most moving portions of
Goop Lab come when
people share their past
traumas and receive love
from others in return. Par-
ticipants genuinely open
up and find connection,
facilitated by whatever
random thing the show
has them go through that
week. It was jarring to
watch a woman work
through life-long anxiety
issues with something
as comparatively banal
as working out in the
snow. However, it was
ultimately the therapy that
came through bonding
with others which comes
off as more important
than the episodes’ health
fads du jour. This sense
of sisterhood through
shared experiences, along
with Goop’s aspirational
status, package well into
self-contained half hour
episodes and make Goop
Lab tremendously watch-
able.
The two best episodes
are the ones about sex
and psychedelics, perhaps
because they are the
furthest from the esoter-
ism that pervades the rest
of the show. What was
striking about Goop when
it talks about sex is how
kindly and affectionately
it is able to do so. In
Goop’s welcoming pastel
colour palate, the male
gaze and shame that are
so common in portrayals
of female pleasure are
washed away. Guided by
legendary sex-educator
Betty Dodson, Goop Lab
goes over the techniques
of masturbation and
connects it to the feminist
struggle for social equality
(even here I fully expect
that we will eventually
see the props involved
as overpriced sex toys
on Goop’s store, where
they have infamously
sold $1500 vibrators).
What appears to motivate
Paltrow’s curiosity is a
desire for radical freedom,
unconstrained here by
expectations of women,
but also frequently else-
where, by ability to spend
and scientific efficacy. In
another episode, she will
have legitimate doctors’
recommendations about
a healthy lifestyle inter-
twined with bunk about
injecting plasma from the
blood back into her skin.
While the doctor’s face
contorts a little as she
describes this, in my mind
from shame or maybe as
she supresses a laugh, in
the text of the show what
is scientifically supported
and what is not can meld
into the something indis-
tinguishable.
insert into your vagina for
alleged hygiene benefits,
their products can come
off as much ridiculous
and potentially hazardous
as they do alluring. When
first describing the show to
friends, they had already
begun proposing drinking
games to play while
watching. A highpoint
comes during the episode
on energy fields, where a
group of Goop employees
receive therapy from a
‘masseur’ who does not
so much touch them but
waves his hands in the air
30cm above their backs.
He first tries it on one of
his long-time customers,
who writhes and squirms
as he walks around and
lightly wiggles his wrist
like a minimalist Nintendo
Wii player, before moving
onto the rest of the people
in the room. After such
a display, I’m not sure
if there is anyone who
wouldn’t want to let out
at least a little moan, as
the Goopers all do, once
their turn comes around,
just to make sure they’re
not missing out. It is not
difficult to see the mar-
keting appeal of Goop as
something similar.

Goop has made a
name for itself in main-
stream consciousness for
courting controversy and
giving a platform to pseu-
doscience, to the extent
they have been accused
of trolling for publicity.
