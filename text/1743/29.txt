En garde: Strong performances for Fencing
F
or the first time
since 2014,
Imperial Men’s
1st has con-
quered the BUCS South
Premiership! This follows
a weekend hosted by
University of Kent, where
matches were played in
a round-robin format.
Arriving with 6/6 victories
from previous matches,
University of Oxford was
the main rival, with losses
only against Imperial and
UCL. At least 3 victories
on Imperial’s side were
required to secure the title.
The first day featured
matches against UCL and
Bristol. The match against
UCL was won comforta-
bly, with a lead of 45-25
after fencing épée, and
with sabre won with the
scores 45-16 (with Ian
Ren scoring an impressive
indicator of +14, of +15
possible). The final result
was 129-85. In the follow-
ing match against Bristol,
the épée team once again
fenced for a comfortable
lead of 45-21, with three
bouts passing without
Bristol scoring a single hit
(despite the possibility of
double hits in épée). The
final score was 135-98.
With this, a victory
against King’s College
the day after would secure
the title. After an even
start in foil, Hugo Briais
fenced a perfect bout of
5-0, leading to a 35-27
lead. This was too much
for King’s to catch up on,
and Harry Peck scored the
conclusive hit half-way
through the last match
in épée. The victory of
135-105 against King’s
turned out to be crucial, as
Oxford ended up winning
the last bout 114-123,
despite an Imperial
victory of 125-114 earlier
in December.
The Premiership title
is the result of a great
season performed by
a hard-working and
committed team. Whilst
Imperial has long had a
strong épée team, led by
Harry Peck and James
Odgers, a combination of
weapon and BUCS rules
makes foil and sabre more
heavily weighted when
final scores are added up.
Therefore, Hong Kong
top foilist Aaron Lee was
a very welcome addition
last year, and was elected
Team Captain to lead the
team through this season.
This year also saw the
addition of UK top sabreur
Ian Ren, who has fenced
formidably throughout
this year and clearly been
a contributing factor to the
league title.
In the same weekend,
Imperial Women’s 1st also
had a strong performance,
winning 3/5 matches. The
épée team was particularly
successful against UCL,
with the score 45-11.
Another very impressive
performance was done
by Francesca Cavallo,
who - despite primarily
being an épéeist - stepped
up in foil against Kent and
reduced a total disadvan-
tage of 87-101 to 97-105.
This was enough for the
team to eventually win
with the scores 121-116,
with Francesca once
again dominating in the
decisive bout. The team
was less lucky against
Bristol, where an initial
disadvantage of 17-45
after foil was caught up to
102-106 before the final
épée bout, which had to
be won by at least 5-1.
Unfortunately, the match
was narrowly lost with the
scores 107-109. Overall,
the Imperial Women’s 1st
placed themselves #4/6 in
the league, securing their
position in the Premier-
ship for the forthcoming
season.

ICSWP: LUSL 2s triumph against Barts 2s
O
n a cold win-
ter’s night
in February
the London
Universities Sport
Leagues (LUSL) 2nd
team, a team of elite and
high-performance athletes
arrive in the dwelling of
Shadwell. Petros, who
from now on shall be
called God, leaves the
Porsche and Company he
owns at home and arrives
in his typical European
style, by moped. They
arrive at Queen Mary’s
pool.
One can only describe
this establishment as “A
Chernobyl Style Call of
Duty Map”. Paint and rust
6, who was later donned
with the name Prick, takes
the ball confidently. After
grappling and physically
abusing half our team, the
2s knew the only response
to violence is even greater
violence.
Prez grabbing the suit
of her opponent pulls
her underwater, and after
hearing a gurgling plea of
“let go of my suit b***h”
utters “how kind of you to
ask … no”. By this stage
God had taken several
blatant hits to torso
from Prick and comes
to El Capitan pleaing to
pummel this excuse of
a water polo player into
oblivion. He holds the
high ground and reluc-
tantly forbids the act.
The score reads 10-7
coming into the final
quarter, but as if by co-
incidence the score board
and clock become “inop-
erable”. Though nay, fear
not because the “ref” pro-
claims himself in charge.
Finlay receives a sublime
through pass, he grapples
the ball coils himself up
and performs the art of the
backshot perfectly placing
the ball in the top corner,
giving the two-finger
salute to girl who kicked
him moments ago. 10-8.
Sir Lancemop scores
seconds later followed
quickly by Thanos. 10-10.
After a quick restart Prick
fouls and takes a shot
11-10, but God replies
with a fantastic dummy
shot 11-11. With one-min-
ute left to go the ball falls
into the hands of acting
goalie El Capitan. He
brings it forward, pauses,
thinks about his pink hot
water bottle awaiting
him at home, and hurls it
towards the bottom right.
The ball sails past the face
of an astoAnished goalie.
11-12!! Though elate not.
For apparently “A goal
was missing on our side...
so it should of ended
12-12.” Bewildered and
amused El Capitan was,
for Bart’s must think him
a fool. But fray not he is
in charge of the input to
BUCS play. #Upthe2s

flaked from every surface,
and despite being a place
of abundant liquid, water
was certainly not the
bountiful fluid. After a
brisk warm up the match
starts immediately. No.
