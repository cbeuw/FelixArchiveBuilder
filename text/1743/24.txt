“If you dance, I’ll
dance
& if you don’t, I’ll
dance anyway”
This unreleased song
by Lana Del Rey is unlike
any of her others. Instead
of her usual complex nar-
rative, the track does not
carry the sound of a heart
breaking. And although
Lana never quite shows
vulnerability in her music,
the lyrics take you back to
the time you had a crush
on someone.
“Mind my wicked
words and tipsy topsy
smirk”
This colourful collage
is a love song written
under heavy influence of
marijuana.
Eclectic yet easy going,
this song resembles slick
rap and R&B, after being
deconstructed and glued
back together with pritt
stick and bodily fluids.
The beats ooze and groove
awkwardly and even the
breezy notion of getting
high turns into a gross,
gooey situation.
your middle-school crush,
Johnny Utah has blessed
us with an insanely cute
track that is all about an
innocent crush. It sounds
like the lovechild of Tame
Impala & Dayglow and
its perfect for baking and
day-dreaming scenarios
with your crush.
“I think you’re the one
Girl, you shouldn’t be
so scared to fall in love”
Phora’s candor leaves
an inedible mark in this
song which is all about
glitter & dirty laundry
that is a part of every re-
lationship. The lyrics are
in earnest & talk about the
kind of love & respect that
all relationships deserve.

“Look at your eyes like,
I’m lacking a punch-
line”
It’s never easy, having
a crush on your friend
and the worst part is the
dreadful period between
the realization & the con-
frontation, the pretending.
This song is suspended in
that moment. What distin-
guishes this record from
any number of othernos-
talgic indie ruminations
on suburban teenhood is
the sparkling optimism
Hovvdy carry with
them.

Slow Dancing in the Dark
There’s a sense that
Joji is searching for peace
in his life beyond failed
romances and conflicted
guilt. On this track, he
cries in the anthemic
chorus, unable to keep
his intentions straight for
two consecutive lines.
He’s cathartic at best, but
there’s a strange comfort
in his neurotic rumination.

“Get a little more close
to me
You’re the only one
who knows me, babe”
Even though Caroline
gets punchy and
self-mocking, this song
is nothing less than
a swooning track, a
waltz-tempo love ballad.
It’s a love song about the
moment of surrender, the
pain preceding it, and the
euphoria after and it’s
a perfect track to play
when you want to nudge
a certain someone in the
right direction.
“Thought it was gonna
last
I’m not uncomfortable
but I feel so uncomforta-
ble”
Colloquial, casual and
feel-good indie-pop with
a hearty bass and beat is
the fundamental of this
song. The opening riff
is incredible, and the
elements added by the
boy band make this song
a worthy listen. Perfect

This song celebrates
falling in love after being
hurt, hoping this time it

“Waking up is so much
fun to do
‘80 movie make out
party, yeah”
This drum-less ballad is
one of the simplest tunes
on The Strokes’ album. It
hurts when you find out
the other person doesn`t
have the same feelings as
you do, and you wasted so
much time thinking about
all the possible things you
could have done together.
“I said meet me halfway
See you on the other
side”
The soul filled artist
would remind you of a
trifecta between Daft
Punk x Breakbot & Jai
Paul. Garren is reminis-
“I was all on my own,
almost glad to be alone”
In “Loving Is Easy,”
O’Connor lays down
instrumentation so bright
and delightful, it
almost comes off as
juvenile—the keyboards
and drums sound like they
could’ve been lifted from
a toy set. He also pos-
sesses a conversational,
bouncy voice that’s easy
to hum along to.
