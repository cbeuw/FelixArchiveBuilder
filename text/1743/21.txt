“
Lasagne’s, like,
very hard to make…
Well actually I don’t
think it is but people
think it is but it’s actually
really fun and really easy.
But I guess it is a lot of
steps compared to, like,
making toast or some-
thing.” Well thank god we
have Paris Hilton to show
us how it’s done! Perhaps
in a bid to reinvigorate
her stagnant career, she
has recently debuted
“Cooking with Paris”, a
sixteen-minute long tu-
torial video teaching you
how to make her “infa-
mous lasagne”. While the
YouTube cooking video
genre is already saturated
with huge personalities
such as the cast of the
Bon Appétit Test Kitchen,
Maangchi , and Binging
with Babish, Paris Hilton
has managed to find her
niche (intentionally or
not) in the world of ab-
surdist comedy cooking.
Starting off by intro-
ducing us to her confused
looking chihuahua,
Diamond Poodle, nestled
in the crook of her arm, she
proceeds to let him roam
free in the kitchen while
she boasts about how
good she is at cooking.
“As you all know,” she
begins, “Well, maybe not
all of you know. People
who do know, know that
I’m an amazing cook”.
It’s a masterclass in verbal
swings and roundabouts,
a style that is possibly
inspired by our mod-
ern-day politicians filibus-
tering to oppose women’s
rights or declare climate
change a non-issue.
According to her
accounts, she spent her
childhood in the kitchen,
helping her mother do
the cooking and baking.
However, cracks very
quickly begin to appear
in her story when she
reveals that she has never
used dried pasta before,
dumping them all into
a pot of cold water and
promising that they will
shrink as they cook so
they will eventually be
submerged. What follows
is a comedy of errors
– anything that could
possibly go wrong does
go wrong.
Swanning around in an
admittedly adorable top,
her curtain of long blonde
hair violating every health
code, she declares an
assortment of cooking
utensils as “so brutal”,
tips a salt-mine’s worth
of salt all over the hobs
and into her beef which
she was “tanning” (before
adding Himalayan pink
salt as a “spice”), forgets
to add the onions and
garlic (“I feel my lasagne
should not have onion or
garlic in it”), and has no
idea what ricotta is even
though she brings way too
much.As can be expected,
there’s generous amounts
of product placement in
the form of health drinks,
“unicorn mist” and maybe
her sunglasses but there
also additions like a
whole shop-front display
of tea-towels emblazoned
with catchy phrases like
“allergic to bullshit”.
What’s most puzzling
about the whole thing
isn’t the motion-sickness
inducing camerawork, nor
is it the complete lack of
recipe details (how much
ricotta are you supposed
to use?) but her fingerless
leather gloves she wears
throughout the cooking
process even after having
picked up Diamond
Baby with them on. She
describes them as her
chef gloves but they’re
unlike any chef gloves
I’ve ever seen. Apparently
not used for powerlifting,
she explains that these
gloves are used for
“sliving” – “but now it’s
2020, you’re still going
to see sliving but sliving
it in a different way – like
cooking lasagne”. If you
have any idea what that
means, please write in and
explain it to us.
I can’t be too hard
on her though. In the
end, she does produce a
lasagne. She may reveal
it to almost no fanfare and
she doesn’t even attempt
to have a taste but it’s a
lasagne nonetheless. No
one died (maybe apart
from the poor intern who
bought ungrated mozza-
rella) and I doubt anyone
got food poisoning
because I have a feeling
the product went straight
to the bin after shooting. It
may be a low bar to set but
in a world full of polished
professionals who spend
their time debating the
utility of bay leaves or
turning their noses up at
green peppers, a cooking
show with zero education-
al value may be what we
need. Even traditionally
gentle entertainment like
the Great British Bake
Off has fallen prey to
increasing technical diffi-
culty and rising stakes, a
fate that, should the series
continue, Cooking with
Paris would be immune
to. One can only hope
that this becomes a whole
series but given the fact
she didn’t seem to know
where she was half the
time, I doubt she will
make it back any time
soon.
In the first issue of this
year’s Fashion section
revival, we brushed
Paris Hilton off as passé,
irrelevant, a remnant of
the noughties but she
has proved us wrong.
She’s not only come back
from celebrity death but
she’s come back with an
instantly viral, infinitely
memeable offering. I
think we can all agree –
that’s hot.
Paris Lasagne Recipe
(or what I can gath-
er)
1.Preheat oven to 350°F
2.Drop the pasta sheets into tepid water and cover
3.Grate the mozzarella
4.Tweet your progress with several novel hashtags
and then decide that they’re bad
5.Mix ricotta with egg until “the correct consist-
ency”
6.Heat a glug of oil in a large pan, wiping out
excess with a paper towel
7.Fry beef mince until “tan”, flattening with a
spatula as you go
8.Season with too much salt and wipe off excess
with a wet paper towel
9.When beef is well-cooked and the colour of
broken dreams, drain in a colander
10.Return beef to pan and add tomato sauce,
bringing to a simmer and further breaking up the
beef with 2 spatulas and a potato masher
11.Build your lasagne, spreading a thin layer of
meat sauce onto the bottom of the lasagne dish
or aluminium tray and adding the pasta sheets
before topping with ricotta mixture
12.Repeat until roasting tray is full
13.Top with grated mozzerella and bake cov-
ered with foil for 35-40mins
14.Take out of oven and serve?
