What is Albion? The play
may just answer that!
Papa Papel (eng: Father
Paper)
B
efore going to
the play, I had
to google what
Albion was. My
search revealed that, in
Latin and Celtic, it could
mean white, rock or crag.
Albion also used to be a
poetic name for Britain.
Nevertheless, not un-
derstanding the name did
not ruin the experience
for me. Albion, written by
Mike Bartlett and directed
by Rupert Gold, is a rich
play with substance.
Some examples of ideas
explored include nostal-
gia, heritage, social class
and the process mourning
following a loss.
As I came in 5 minutes
late, we were placed in
an obstructed view seat
for the first two thirds of
the play. Following the
interval, I was relocated
close to the front row,
which gave me a vastly
different perspective.
Being in the obstructed
seat, the play had to be
big and clear enough for
us at the back seats to feel
the emotion and it did just
that. However, at the front
few seats the experience
was phenomenal and
made you feel like you
were peering into the lives
of the characters.
What was quite impres-
sive about Albion is that
the whole play Miriam
Buether’s set was based
in the same garden. The
scene changes were subtle
and helped aid the idea of
the passage of time and
the changes that come
with it. The music was
chosen well, and I found
myself wanting to request
the names of some of the
songs played.
The acting from the
overall cast was very
strong, however there
were a few points that felt
screechy and overacted.
Despite this, I found
myself enjoying the
different styles that each
actor brought to stage.
Some parts of the plot
were quite extravagant
and appeared slightly
random to me however,
for the most part, a lot of
the creative choices felt
purposeful.
This play was quite
unique, which made it
quite difficult to compare
it to my previous expe-
riences. The lighting by
Neil Austin couldn’t also
go unappreciated since I
found it helped focus the
audience on the pivotal
characters at chaotic parts.
The audience, I felt, were
grounded the whole time.
My favourite scene which
I felt was presented the
most effectively is the
appearance of the dead
son, which is still vivid in
my mind.
Overall, Albion was
an incredibly enjoyable
experience, with each
member of the cast and
creative team bringing
something unique to the
table in this impressive
production.
I
f there’s something
even non-arts-lovers
know about art, it’s
Picasso: he is the
definition of true artistic
genius. With countless ex-
hibitions since his young
age of 13 in 1895, a whole
museum about him in
Paris, and with some stat-
ing that there’s virtually
nothing in modern art that
he hasn’t started, curating
a Picasso exhibition with
a novel feel to it in today’s
day and age is a sincere
challenge.
Royal Academy of Arts
has taken on this with
a storm (storm Ciara?)
with their new exhibition
“Picasso and Paper”. The
exhibition attempts to
explore Picasso’s different
phases through his love
for paper. Throughout the
10 decades he blessed the
earth with his art, it turns
out he showed his love for
paper in many different
ways.
He folded it, burned it,
ripped it, cut it in clever
ways and glued it all
together again. He drew
cheeky sketches in Vogue
magazines and folded gui-
tar-like pieces out of card
and strings. His naivete
and curious exploring
of different techniques
shows a new side of this
epic man. It is easy to
forget that people like
Picasso weren’t always
good at art. But when
you’re standing in front of
a framed 2 inch skull he’s
ripped out of yellowing
paper during WWII when
materials were scarce, his
artistic process suddenly
feels more tangible.
Picasso and Paper has
got a lot more than ripped
pieces of paper to offer. It
features a lot of his more
conventional works too.
There’s a huge wall-sized
canvas made of cut out
pieces of different types
of wallpaper. At first this
piece has a lot of chaotic
energy, but the more you
look, the more details
come out, and the three
womendepictedentangled
in their mundane activities
come alive. If there is one
thing that is clear through
this extensive exhibition
(the website tells you to
allow at least 1-2 hours
for it) it is that Picasso
has gone through as many
phases as there are stars in
the sky. The blue period,
the rose period. The phase
where he made really big,
round facial features. The
phase when he drew no
faces at all. Phases based
on the different women
in his life, of which there
were many. Phases where
he just printed newspaper
letters on things, or etched
copper.
One thing is clear from
all these years of different
art created by Picasso; he
was always a genius. No
wonder his father, a pro-
fessor of art and an artist
himself, gave up painting
when Picasso surpassed
him at age 13. If you visit
Picasso and Paper you
might feel like giving up
painting too.
