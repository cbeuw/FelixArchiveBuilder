The cost of Fast fashion
H
ave you
ever thought
about how
clothes from
Primark, ASOS, H&M
and Uniqlo are so cheap?
The answer lies in their
unethical business model
that exploits workers for
cheap labour in countries
abroad and their abuse of
the environment with no
repercussions.
Fast fashion refers
to clothes that are not
made to last. They are
clothes that are trendy
today, and out of mode by
tomorrow. The clothes are
sold cheaply and in large
quantities to maximise
revenue. Those garments
move from the runway to
stores at incredible speed,
but they end up in the
trash even faster.
Millions of customers
participate in this mindless
consumption of fashion,
and it has led to huge en-
vironmental detriments. It
is estimated that 12 billion
tonnes of reusable textiles
go to landfills every year,
and this makes up 30% of
all total waste.
The fast fashion
industry emits 1.2 billion
tons of CO2 equivalent
per year, which is about
5% of total global emis-
sions. To put this into
perspective, this sky-high
carbon footprint is more
than the emissions created
by air travel and interna-
tional shipping.
Furthermore, fast
fashion is a huge threat
to water resources. This
is largely due to how
water intensive cotton
plants are. It takes about
2,000 gallons of water to
produce a pair of jeans
(more than enough for
one person to drink for 10
years) and it takes about
700 gallons of water to
produce one cotton shirt
(enough for one person
to drink for over three
years).
Overall, the fashion
industry is responsible for
20% of all industrial water
pollution worldwide.
Production of textiles
is said to use over three
thousand types of chemi-
cals, and textile dyeing is
the world’s second-largest
polluter of water, as water
from the dyeing process is
dumped into rivers.
Most fast fashion
clothing is made from pol-
yester, which releases two
to three times more carbon
emissions than cotton
during production and
does not biodegrade. It is

“The fast

about 5% of

estimated that washing
fast fashion pieces made
from polyester releases
500,000 tons of microfib-
ers into the ocean each
year, which is the equiv-
alent of 50 billion plastic
bottles.
There is also another
horrificpracticeofburning
unsold clothes (not limited
to fast fashion, as brands
like Louis Vuitton and
Burberry also participate
in this). This happens
because of the fast
fashion cycles, with many
clothes unfashionable
very quickly, and with no
demand. The brands also
don’t donate the clothes,
as they are worried of do-
nations devaluating their
brand.
Moreover, fast fashion
brands often attempt
greenwashing and pretend
that their products are
more environmentally
friendly than they really
are. They are vague about
their environmental and
social commitments and
launch sustainability
campaigns that are totally
devoid of transparency.
That doesn’t however
stop them from claiming
that their products are
“ethical” and “sustaina-
ble”.
The horrific conse-
quences of fast fashion
extend beyond the envi-
ronmental damages, there
is also a huge amount of
exploitation of workers in
order to produce clothing
so cheap. Garment factory
workers’ wage starts
incredibly low at just £25
a month, and they work 14
hours a day. The workers
are mostly women, and
many have reported
physical and verbal abuse
at work. There is also no
standard for health and
safety; fast fashion facto-
ries lack ventilation, and
workers will breath in
toxic substances and fibre
dust in unsafe buildings.
In the infamous 2013
Dhaka garment factory
collapse, over a thousand
workers were killed in
a factory that supplied
for the likes of Primark,
Monsoon, Prada, Gucci
and more. Worker’s
unions are also prohibited
which stops meaningful
changes from happening.
Investigations have also
found that H&M has used
child labour in factories in
Myanmar.
As consumers, we
can combat fast fashion,
mostly by boycotting
their products and not
spending our money on
their products. There is a
saying that one votes with
their money, and by not
spending money on fast
fashion, we can help stop
the consequences. A great
thing to do would be to
start thrift shopping; you
can find many amazing
clothes for good prices
in vintage shops, and
many true fashionistas
shop this way. When
you have a clothing you
no longer need, you can
always donate it, or even
repurpose it, as fabrics
can have multiple uses.
Another important thing
is to have conversations
and raise awareness on
the consequences of fast
fashion. The only reason
those brands thrive is
because of the lack of
transparency and lack of
knowledge of consumers
on the true horrific nature
of the industry, which is
hidden with bright and
cheerful advertisements.
The more people become
conscious of their con-
sumerism, the less power
those brands will have.
