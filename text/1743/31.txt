31
with record double gold medal haul at BUCS
This time the ref had seen
enough and stopped the
bout. Amy secured her
ticket to the final by first
round stoppage.
The day of the final
arrived. Amy needed to
overcome a boxer from
the top sporting university
of Nottingham to become
national champion. The
first round begun with
her challenger yet again
charging forward and des-
perate to get inside of the
taller boxer’s long reach.
Nottingham clearly had a
game plan. It was Mike
Tyson who once said:
“everybody has a plan
until they get punched in
the mouth”. The Notting-
ham plan went out the
window, with Imperial’s
boxer using some clever
foot movement to dance
away from her opponent
and quickly tire them out.
Then, when the moment
was right, The Hammer
unleashed a single
powerful backhand that
rocked the Nottingham
boxer and resulted in a
standing count just before
the end of the first round.
The second round started
with Amy still full of
energy, but her opponent
already looking defeated.
It was inevitable: with the
Nottingham boxer’s hands
dropping, Amy took full
advantage by ending the
fight with some more
powerful backhands.
The result: Amy national
champion by stoppage in
the second round of the
final!
When asked what
preparation gave her the
edge, Amy told us she
was confident because
of how hard she worked:
“I trained every day just
for this moment! 5 days
of boxing plus a 4-mile
competitions. Imperial’s Boxing continue to stack up the titles.
morning run and hill
sprints every week. I
even kept this up over the
Christmas break!”.
However, Imperial’s
day was not finished yet.
Biomedical PhD student
Callum McCarthy from
Bletchley was looking to
earn Imperial’s second
gold medal of the day.
Being in the elite 8-15
bouts category for
52-56kg male boxers
meant there was only one
other boxer in the whole
of the UK at Callum’s
level and so he had a
straight final. For the first
shots to his opponent’s
head kept him at bay
before unleashing the oc-
casional right hook to the
body to break him down.
Callum went into the third
and final round arguably
with a slight edge, but
it was still all to play for
as both competitors were
full of energy and hungry
to be crowned champion.
The third round started in
similar fashion before…
BANG. Callum landed
a straight backhand
that gave the Newcastle
boxer the standing count.
60 seconds to go. Both
gladiators are throwing
everything at each other.
Then, with 20 seconds
left, the Newcastle boxer
has backed Callum onto
the ropes but the Imperial
boxer cleverly twists
away and turns it to his
advantage, landing a few
punches in quick succes-
sion to give his opponent
a standing count again and
seal a dominant victory.
Callum McCarthy: second
Imperial champion of
the day by unanimous
decision in the final!

down to his game plan:
