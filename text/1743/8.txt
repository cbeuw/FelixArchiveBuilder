I
t’s no secret that
the Union has had
a rough couple of
years. In the last
twelve months, Felix
has, to mention just a
few, reported on: The
Union’s worsening
financial position,
dwindling sales at the
bars, the closure of the
kitchens due to health
and safety concerns,
the resignation of the
managing director,
the resignation of a
staggering percentage
of staff, and repeated
failures to support CSPs
and CUs properly. My
personal opinion is that
the organisation is rud-
derless, without a clear
direction, and failing in
its key function – acting
as a Union for its mem-
bers. Now, before I go
any further, I would like
to point out that I think
we hit rock bottom a
while ago and that the
future of the Union, with
proper leadership, looks
brighter.
When people
comment on the failings
of the Union they will
generally be met with
the same retort. This
will normally go some-
thing along the lines
of gushing about how
good the Union is when
it comes to elections.
Specifically, the spring
Leadership Elections.
If you’ve somehow
managed to miss this
s e l f - c o n g r a t u l a t o r y
parade, it happens in
March. Every March.
In my four years at the
university, the record
hasn’t been changed
and talking to former
students, it’s been going
on for a long time.
The praise goes
somewhere along the
lines of: “unprecedented
turn out”, “more roles
filled”, “more roles”.
It’s true, the Union does
regularly achieve one
of the highest turnouts
for university elections,
and people standing for
the majority of its nearly
800 roles. Now, there
are arguments to be
made about how these
statistics have very little
to do with the actions of
the Union and more to
do with things like the
size of the university,
the constituent union
structures, the fact
that ICU includes CSP
elections in its turnout
figure (not a practice
that I could find at any
other Universities) etc.
Whether any of these
things are true, is not
something that I care
about or something that
matters. My view on the
matter is quite simple.
The Union is good at
elections. Good. Move
on.
You see, in my ex-
perience as a ‘senior
volunteer’ for the Union
and in the experience of
many others that I have
spoken to, this time
of year is increasingly
frustrating. Around
about now, more and
more aspects of the
Union cease to function
as entire teams of staff’s
attention is turned
towards elections.
Meetings upon meetings
are held about increas-
ing turnout and improv-
ing elections. Access to
Union communication
channels is all but pro-
hibited because they are
reserved for elections.
Significant sums of
money are spent on ad-
vertising and running the
elections. For a decent
ingly disengaged with
a Union whose goals
they aren’t aware of and
whose actions go unno-
ticed. As the University
grows, the voter turnout
will likely increase and
as the Union continues
to flounder, we are likely
to see more “record
breaking engagement”
as people use their vote
in protest. All of this
will justify the Union’s
decision to partially stop
functioning for three
months a year and hide
the fact that, due to poor
communication, the
Union is becoming more
and more irrelevant with
each passing year.
I’m not suggesting
that the Union ceases
to do any work towards
elections, only that, as
when revising for an
exam, they review their
resources and impor-
tance that they attach
to the event. Put it this
way, if you consistently
got 80% in an exam
module year on year and
50% in another, it would
be illogical to commit
more of your resources
to improving the 80% as
the law of diminishing
returns holds true.
As a petty final point,
it would be nice if the
Union held itself to
the same standards it
holds candidates to. The
number of too-close-to-
gether posters and the
new sticker campaign
would definitely have
me lodging a complaint.
Don’t forget to
nominate yourself
and lead the change at
Imperial. STAND.
Elections really make the Union drop the ball // Wikimedia
few months of the year,
the Union stops really
functioning properly.
In 2016 the National
Union of Students
(NUS) carried out some
analysis on student
union elections and
election turnout. One
of the key findings of
the analysis was that
the voter turnout was
directly correlated to the
number of positions and
the number of candi-
dates standing for those
positions. So really, if
the Union’s sole aim
is going to be patting
themselves on the back
for voter turnout, they
should just concentrate
on getting more people
to stand for election. Ah
hah they might say, in-
creasing the number of
candidates requires the
resources that the Union
throws at elections.
However, in my expe-
rience and in talking
to others, not knowing
about roles is not the
reason for not standing.
It’s that, increasingly,
being a volunteer for the
Union is a thankless task
where you are likely to
spend a considerable
proportion of your year
banging your head
against a wall trying to
solve issues that would
be easy to solve if you
had… adequate staff
support.
The situation we
find ourselves in seems
to be a box ticking
exercise, an easy way
for the Union to claim
that they are successful
in reaching out and
communicating with
students. The reality we
find ourselves in could
not be further from this.
Students are increas-
