Compatability and Controversy.
With no huge story this week, and no recent game to review I thought it would be a great chance to round up a
load of different stories that happened over the last week.

PS5 and Xbox Series
In a recent earnings call,
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guille-
mot is quoted saying that
both Microsoft and Sony’s
upcoming consoles “Will
be running almost all the
back catalogue of the
previous consoles”.This is
amazing news for anyone
that owns an Xbox One
or PS4, but also anyone
that loves collecting older
games from consoles like
the PS1 and the Original
Xbox – here I come Halo
and Spyro!
The best part of this
is the ability to declutter
my gaming set up. It
means I can have one
console dedicated to each
company set up on my
desk and actually get to
play older games at uni
again! For some it also
means that they could sell
their older consoles and
use that money to fund
a new one – and for col-
lectors it means they can
much more easily switch
between games on the ﬂy
without having to switch
around cables every two
minutes.
Another positive that
comes from this is the pos-
sibility of certain games
being enhanced for the
next generation consoles.
We have already seen
this a bit with the Xbox
One, enhancing Xbox
360 games via software
updates – it’s a great thing
to see from businesses
that are usually driven by
proﬁt and not much else…
Wonderful 101 port
Platinum Games, the
developer that brought
you Bayonetta, Viewtiful
Joe and Astral Chain
have ﬁnally begun their
foray into self-publishing.
Early in January, the ﬁrm
secured funding from
Tencent to accelerate its
self-publishing ambition.
Despite this, Platinum is
seeking funding from us,
the gamers. They set up a
Kickstarter campaign for
the creation of a remaster
of the somewhat forgotten
Wii U game ‘Wonderful
101’. With their funding
goal set at a little under
£40,000 it seemed like
that would be easily
passed. Well, it was, by
an insane margin. So
much so that at the time
of writing the campaign
sits at £1,220,000 of
“Platinum
set up a
Kickstarter
campaign for
the creation
of a remaster
of Wonderful
101.”
“Animal
crossing is not
going to allow
cloud saving.
Yup, you read
that right!”
funding with 24 days still
to go! That means that
not only is Wonderful
101 being ported to the
Switch, but also a Steam
version, a PS4 version,
a time attack mode (yay
speedruns), and a new 2D
side scrolling adventure
in the Wonderful 101
universe named “Luka’s
First Mission”.
I have never played
Wonderful 101, so the
opportunity to do so
would be awesome. There
is a passionate and vocal
fanbase for this action-ad-
venture games that has
clearly shown up in spades
to support Platinum.
With released slated for
November 2020, I sit in
great anticipation for the
chance to ﬁnally give this
niche title a go.
Another intriguing
event that has occurred
with this Kickstarter, is
a mysterious website
dubbed “The Platinum
Four”. So far the website
just shows 4 items on a
page, with a giant ‘4’ at
the top. The ﬁrst of these
items is the Wonderful
101 port, with the other
three simply labelled
‘coming soon’. This has
caused a lot of active
discussion in the gaming
community with many
different theories as to
what else could be coming
from Platinum in future
months. My opinion?
I’m glad you asked kind
stranger! One of these
HAS to be Bayonetta 3.
It was announced with a
teaser trailer over 2 years
ago and we haven’t heard
anything else since about
it. I also think that one
announcement may come
that won’t shock too many
people: a port of Astral
Chain to other consoles.
Astral Chain was a big
success for Platinum on
the Switch last year, and
now with funding from
Tencent, I imagine that
they will be looking to
expand the install size for
Astral Chain. My ﬁnal
prediction is more of a
hope. I would love to
see Viewtiful Joe either
ported to the Switch, or, if
we want to go really crazy,
maybe even a sequel!
Animal Crossing
Animal Crossing New
Horizons is the next
upcoming installation
in the Animal Crossing
franchise, and the ﬁrst
to release on the Switch.
It is greatly anticipated
by many, with its wide
appeal and addictive daily
gameplay loot of collect-
ing bugs and fruit, all the
while trying to clear your
debt with Tom Nook. So,
how could a game that
seems so friendly on the
surface end up garnering
so much controversy.
Well – Nintendo is acting
like a grandma again and
not keeping up with the
technology of today!
Firstly, Animal
Crossing is not going to
allow cloud saving. Yup,
you read that right! If
you lose your Switch or it
breaks, there is no hope of
getting your island back!
Nintendo’s reasoning
behind this is that the
game uses time mechan-
ics and having a cloud
save might allow players
to effectively rewind time.
Now I would understand
this reason if Animal
Crossing was a compet-
itive game, but come
on… it’s freaking Animal
Crossing! Not only this,
but also you are only
allowed one island per
Switch. That means if you
have multiple accounts
you can still only have
one island. Even if you
buy a second game you
are limited to one island,
despite the fact you have
paid for 2 games. I think
this is quite frankly ri-
diculous. People who use
their Switch as a family
device with multiple
accounts for whoever
uses this are bound to
get very annoyed. On the
bright side, Nintendo have
acknowledged the fan
backlash and are looking
for ways of ﬁxing it in
time – Nintendo have a
good history of listening
to fans (in recent years
at least) so at least we
can hope they go back on
these statements by the
time the game is out on
March 20th.
The Kickstarter for Wonderful101 Remastered is unbelievably successful! // Kickstarter
