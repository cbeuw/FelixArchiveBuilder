Policy Working
Group, or the SRI group
for short, is due to an-
nounce their decision
on months of proposals
and meetings to discuss
the college’s contentious
investments. At the time
of writing, this result is
unknown, but what is
sure is that the SRI group
has had its work cut out.
During years of inaction
while other universities
have surged ahead. It has
also received plenty of
input with proposals from
groups including Divest
Imperial, the Union, and
the Imperial College
branch of Extinction
Rebellion (XRIC).
The XRIC proposal,
published as an open letter
on Twitter and Facebook,
lists five key demands
from the college (see box
to the left “Five Demands
for Imperial”).
The rise in engagement
on environmental issues
amongst the staff and
student community over
the past couple of years
contrasts the inaction of
Imperial College adminis-
tration on environmental
action. It lags at 130th
place, just 14 places
from the bottom of the
People and Planet league
table, which ranks UK
universities according
to their investments and
policies on ethics and
the environment. This is
after considering recent
improvements such as
reduction in single-use
plastic.
Non-violent direct
action has served as
the only platform to
raise serious concerns
over Imperial College’s
investments when
negotiation has been
met for years with
inaction. And sadly
being vocal seems to be
the only way of making
headway. The college
announced the creation
of the SRI last year on
November 28th
, after
XRIC, Divest Imperial,
and the UCU November
announced a Climate
Strike, which was held
on 29th
November. The
five demands point to
the areas that have been
in the blind spot of the
college. These demands
unscrupulous companies
such as Equinor, the
oil company, and arms
manufacturer Lockhead
Martin. It also has sig-
nificant investments in
other companies with
highly environmentally
and socially damaging
activities through other
financial products it
uses.
Offset greenhouse
emissions from travel
Setting up a fund for
carbon offsetting, or in-
vesting to counter green-
house gas emissions due
from travel, would be
effective in tackling one
of the college’s largest
environmental impacts.

open up room for plenty
of discussion, so for
want of space this article
will focus on three of
them.
Cease investing
funds into non-renew-
able energy
First and foremost,
divestment. At the
November Climate
Strike, college members
publicly voiced their
exasperation at the col-
lege’s former policy of
“stonewalling” staff and
students on concerns
over its investment port-
folio. A freedom of in-
formation request in the
past month shows that
despite pressure from
student-run campaign

2014, the college contin-
ues to invest directly into
1. Cease investing
funds into non-renew-
able energy projects
and into investment
schemes reliant on
these sectors. New in-
vestments should be
diverted to environ-
mentally and socially
positive projects as
soon as possible.
2. Strengthen and
deepen democratic
ways for all members
of the college to be
engaged with deci-
sions on the use of
college funds through
regular reviews of the
college funds.
3. Use environmen-
tal impact criteria,
such as the proportion
of graduates going
into green jobs in
annual reporting.
4. Create an
internal fund to offset
greenhouse emissions
from travel for the
activities of members
of the college
5. Act on the social
dimensions of the
climate crisis - es-
tablish partnerships
and scholarships for
students from coun-
tries most vulnerable
to the climate and
ecological crises.
