I
nclusivity and
diversity are the
buzzwords of the
moment. Everywhere
you look, executives are
aching to talk about how
they’re trying their very
utmost to increase the di-
versity of their workforce
and maximise inclusivity.
Glibness aside, if you
value equality of opportu-
nity, both of these things
are highly important.
Different groups have
different disadvantages,
often as a result of histori-
cal or institutional factors
that negatively impact the
individuals that make up
these groups. The con-
cept of intersectionality,
that individuals can be a
part of different groups
that are advantaged and
disadvantaged in different
ways neatly encompasses
that concept. If Imperial is
to be meritocratic, it really
needs to handle the differ-
ent challenges that each
individual experiences
as part of the different
communities studying
here. As a gay white man
with white heteronorma-
tive middle-class parents
studying physics, I am
definitely not equipped to
discuss the experiences
of all minority groups.
Nevertheless, I still feel
the need to discuss the
diversity and inclusivity
within an institution that,
perhaps fittingly, names
itself “Imperial” College
London.
Last week I was at an
Imperial LGBT+ careers
fair. Stephen Curry the
Assistant Provost for
Equality, Diversity and
Inclusion (a white man)
praised the University
for climbing around
100 places in the 2020
took part in the Index.
Although climbing 100
places is an impressive
achievement, there is
clearly still much that
needs to be done, particu-
larly in the Physics depart-
ment. In the Department,
very few undergraduates
are female. There are only
a handful of black un-
dergraduates, in a cohort
of almost a thousand.
Of those, even fewer are
black and female, and this
is not to mention other
intersections.
One could argue that
it is not necessarily the
fault of a University like
Imperial College London
that a cohort of students
and staff is not diverse,
maybe more the fault
of society as a whole.
Although not diverse,
perhaps Imperial is inclu-
sive? Unfortunately, for a
whole range of minority
groups the Physics depart-
ment is failing.
The Physics LGBT+
Network ran a survey last
month to gauge the inclu-
sivity of the toilet/shower
facilities in Blackett Lab-
oratory. There were 216
responses from Physics
staff and students. From
those, 43% would benefit
from gender neutral toilet
facilities. Moreover, of the
respondents 24% believe
that the current facilities
are not inclusive. I am
of the opinion that 24%
is a somewhat worrying
figure. Currently there
are only male, female,
and two accessible toilets,
with both accessible
toilets on the 9th floor.
Do the other 76% of
respondents believe there
to be only two genders?
Or do they believe it is
acceptable for someone to
have to travel many floors
each time they want to use
a toilet during the day?
Maybe we shouldn’t ask
Simone’s opinion on that
one.
In the same survey, 28%
of respondents believed
that they would benefit
from baby changing fa-
cilities in the Department.
Currently there are no
baby changing facilities
available. Balancing
childcare with academia
is already a seemingly
impossible task, so why
make it harder?
Imperial also struggles
to manage the needs of
the trans community.
Although Imperial has a
trans staff policy they lack
a trans student policy,
making it incredibly
challenging for staff and
the college to deal with a
student that is transition-
ing. Naturally, this will
have a detrimental effect
on the student, making a
difficult time even more
difficult.
In a survey run by
Felix in March 2018, 40%
of 300 respondents had
experienced misogyny
at Imperial, and over
70% had experienced
peers making derogatory
comments about women.
A workshop hosted by
the Director of Devel-
opment for UN Women
UK last term triggered
the conversation around
misogyny amongst
students in the Physics
Department. There was
talk of an undergraduate
woman being told by
an academic that as a
woman she would not be
recognised unless she had
a PhD. There was talk of
a laboratory technician
talking over a female
student to another male
student, despite her asking
for help first. Things don’t
seem to have changed
drastically since March
2018.
If you have recently
walked through the
Physics Department you
may have noticed the
rainbow “ally” stickers
on some office doors. The
idea behind the scheme
is that volunteering
staff members received
bespoke LGBT+ ally
training and are then given
the stickers. A great idea,
it would seem. Until you
find out that only 3 of the
9 allies actually attended
the training session.
Other staff, have managed
to simply acquire the
stickers. A great idea for
pinkwashing. One might
begin to think maybe the
Physics Department aren’t
doing all they could to be
completely inclusive.
I’ll leave you with this.
Just before entering the
main lecture theatre in
the Physics Department,
you will be greeted by a
display featuring pictures
of past Heads of Depart-
ment, the vast majority
of which are white men.
When attending lectures,
you will be greeted by
amazing lecturers, the
vast majority of which are
white men. When attend-
ing tutorials, you will be
helped by great tutors, the
vast majority of which are
white men. You probably
get the idea. Although we
can’t change the past, we
can definitely shape the
future. That is up to us.
Diversity flags. The Physics Department wouldn’t get it // Wikimedia
