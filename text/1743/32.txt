IC Waterpolo – (egg)beating to victory: Part 1
I
mperial College

Polo – chances
are, you’ve seen an
ICSWP hoodie or beanie
around campus. But who
are these people, what
is their legacy? Why
are they participating in
shameless self promotion
by having an article in
Felix for Varsity 2020? I
have caught up with two
of the captains playing on
Friday 28th
for a chat.
Sasha is the captain
for LUSL 1s. He’s young
but experienced, playing
for BUCS alongside his
captainship. LUSL 1s
are composed primarily
of BUCS players and
Orlando – a legend who
for some reason, has
recently disappeared.
Whether he was there in
the first place remains to
be seen. Tom is the captain
for LUSL2s – quirky, with
powerful dance moves, he
#ups the twos with a sense
of identity and purpose.
The 2s are a mixed bunch
– most of them start
out as beginners when
they join the club and
stay there for the banter
that is passed through
generations of 2s players.
From very old (Petros) to
ones that look like a mop
(Lancemop) they rise past
all limitations and surpass
everyone’s expectations.
Here are the secrets to
their success.
Nastya: What teams
are in your league
and who have you
played so far?
Sasha: We have only
played a couple of games
so far. We play UCL in
their square pool, who we
have destroyed, Imperial
2s, Imperial Medics and
Barts 2s, who we have to
beat because somehow
they’re at the top of the
league so far.
Tom: We play most
other unis – Bart-
holomew’s, KCL, UCL,
Imperial Medics. So far,
we have only lost against
KCL and 1sts. Unless you
count that time when we
won against the medics,
but conceded the game
because we brought too
many players.
Nastya: How did you
form and train the
teams?
Sasha: Usually
everyone has training
Monday, Wednesday
and Friday. LUSL has a
session on Saturday and
BUCS has a session on
Sunday. We encouraged
everyone to come as
much as possible, and
erages… No, I’m joking,
but we have a Saturday
session only for LUSL,
so we’re not intimidated
by the BUCS players any
more – that’s been really
helpful. The most impor-
tant thing to training is
to have good team spirit,
shit chat and banter on the
side.
Nastya: What is your
team like and how do
you involve every-
one?
Sasha: Our team is made
up of mainly BUCS
players, as this year we
have had a large joining
of experienced 4th
years
and complete begin-
ners, and Orlando. He’s
disappeared recently, but
we miss him and hope
he comes back. Since
the LUSL rules state that
there must be two girls in
the water at all time, our
team is split about evenly
for girls and boys – I
usually have 5 girls on
the team per game. That
way Alex is in goal, two
girls are outfield, two on
the bench.
Tom: There’s 21
players in the team. For
the first time ever we’ve
had enough girls to have
a BUCS team and girls to
play on the LUSL team
only. I have appointed
Clem as my “go to” girl
in the LUSL 2s team. I
think in the group chat,
I can come off as a little
intimidating, and not quite
as approachable as I’d like
to be, especially for the
girls. Clem always talks
to them and gets them to
play. She also does the
subs – she knows more
about how much they
want to play, ect. I just
have to be conscious when
writing Facebook posts
to not only talk about the
guys, and not have the
banter be too laddish – I
can be susceptible to
that sometimes, but it’s
about making sure the
girls included and there’s
enough girls playing to
make them want to keep
coming and playing.
Nastya: What’s the
goalie situation?
Sasha: We usually have
Alex, who used to be a
goalie for St Andrews
women’s team or Joe,
who is the men’s BUCS
goalie.
Tom: Ahaha, the goalie
situation. It’s as if I can
find a goalie. There are
no LUSL 2s goalies, so I
usually steal some from
theotherteams,depending
on who’s around. There’s
loads of good goalies in
the club, but not LUSL 2s
goalies. Have I considered
training one up? I mean,
it’s always hard to “sac-
rifice” a fresher, as they
want the glory of having
scored the goals, playing
outfield, and it’s hard
to convince a fresher to
stay in goal. Maybe next
year, but unfortunately,
my time as captain will
be coming to an end, so,
that next year’s problem.
Also, Giovanni, if you’re
reading this, you twat, you
were supposed to be the
one that’s coming to play
our goalie.
Nastya: What’s the
relationship between
LUSL 1s, 2s and the
BUCS teams?
Sasha: We’re all good
friends I think. Being
captain this year has made
me more vocal in BUCS
games and has given me
more authority. I don’t
personally have a prefer-
ence between LUSL 1s
and BUCS teams.
Tom: You know like if
you had a little brother,
and you love them dearly,
but if they do anything
better than you, you start
feeling sick and you have
to be better than them at
all cost. That’s kind of
the relationship between
the 1s and 2s, with the 2s
being the little brother,
who gets all the love and
attention and has all the
best shit chat and who is
actually quite good and
makes the 1s scared. It’s
what happens when we
played the 1sts last week,
they started out letting
us score some goals and
being all nice and lovey-
dovey, then the LUSL 2s
scared them and they got
quite aggressive. LUSL
1s have to make sure they
win, otherwise they’re
going to have a massive
fit – don’t tell Sasha I said
that. As for the BUCS
teams, the BUCS girls
always get my girls to play
for them, so they’re really
close, but the BUCS boys
are generally a bit more
laddish compared to us.
BUCS guys and LUSL 2s
don’t mix too much, but
in goal, I was trying to
pass him the ball, but since
they insisted on playing
using a size 4 ball, it just
skimmed under his arm
into the net. We still have
four games to play and
Barts away is usually the
best game of the season.
Sasha scored ucl’s only
goal into joe by backhand
– ball skimmed under arm
into the net
Tom: Hussein getting
a match twat award for
every match of the season
so far. Match twat goes
to the person who did
the dumbest thing during
a match. There was one
time when Hussein asked
me if he can get in next, I
said yes. Halfway through
the game he jumped in the
water without telling the
guy to come out. Another
time when he was
standing in the shallow
end in Ethos, the ref
called him for jumping,
and he was holding the
ball, looking at the ref like
“what do you mean I’m
standing?” Petros scored
a few amazing goals, still
waiting for someone to
score a bicy (bicycle-kick
the ball in the goal).
Finlay’s had a few great
ones – he’s famous for his
back shots, but he’s not
done many this year. I’ve
got a spreadsheet with the
different types of shots
people do, and he’s on two
backshots and I’m on one,
so he needs to watch out
for the backshot trophy to
be taken by someone else.
Will their hopes and
declarations prove to be
true?
Stay tuned to find out,
or come watch the epic
Varsity game on 28th
February, at 20.30 in the
Ethos pool!

“at some point
it got really
violent and
there were six
people all over
each other”
they support each other in
and out of the pool.
Nastya: What are
the highlights of the
season?
Sasha: Finlay’s back-
shots have not worked
that well this year – he
hit the keeper in nose in
UCL. Oh wait, that was
last year. The UCL game
was quite messy - Simon
threw the ball after the
whistle, at some point
it got really violent and
there were six people all
over each other. None of
the refs knew what was
going on, it was a mess.
I scored UCL’s goal into
Joe by backhand. Joe was
“Match twat
goes to
the person
who did the
dumbest
thing during a
match”
whoever trains gets the
spot in a game. We’ve
managed to always have
13 players per game. We
thought that the 4th
years,
who came with previous
experience, should play as
much as possible, so that
they can learn the British
rules. We wanted to
have more inexperienced
players to play for the
firsts as well, as LUSL 2s
have 21 players in their
team, but we couldn’t as
that’s strictly disallowed.
Tom: Out of the team,
only Petros played before.
Henry says he was a polo
captain, but we all know
that’s a sympathy card.
