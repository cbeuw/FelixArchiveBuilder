Days You Should Be Celebrating But You’re Not
HANGMAN
While St Valentine’s
Day gets a load of
attention, the guy was
a loser. So rather than
celebrating his day,
here is a list of better
occasionsforFeb14th.

Number 1. National
Ferris Wheel Day
38 children last year
were born on a Ferris
wheel meaning that the
probability that one of
them is reading this article
is 0%. Because they’re
babies.
Number 2. Pet Theft
Awareness Day
Did you know that
Valentine’s day was
actually created in the 40’s
by a gang of opportunistic
Dachshund thieves that
offered free meals to
couples while their fellow
crims stole hundreds of
pounds? Think about
that next time you kiss
someone.
Number 3. Parents’
Worship Day
In some parts of India
children use the 14th of
February to show their
love and appreciation for
their parents. Just goes to
show how desperate some
people get during a dry
spell.
Number 4. National
Condom Awareness
Day
There is a serious crisis of
young condoms getting
knocked over crossing
the road or accepting
gifts from strangers going
on right now. Condom
parents! Teach your kids
awareness!
Number 5.
Quirky Alone Day
This one is for all you
people out there that
are so quirky that you
sometimes randomly
scream at parties. You’re
so cool and everyone
wants to be you.
Number 6. Great
Yard Bird Count Day
This one is for the older
members of the NegaFelix
readership. If you sit
in your front room and
record the time and day of
when women come past
over the course of a week
you will save time and
energy. No point perving
if there ain’t nobody to
perv on!
Number 7.
International Book
giving Day

Number 8. Federick
Douglass Day
I have no idea who
Frederick Douglass is but
the charades game that my
co-editor is playing with
me allows me to tell you
that he was a huge Lady
Gaga fan. He must be so
grateful to Pete Buttigieg
for helping get his name
out. What a man!

Number 9.
Manchan Day
This guy asked God to
send a plague to Ireland
in order to deal with the
overpopulation problem
but ended up dying in the
plague that started that
year. So metal.
Number 10. World
Sound Healing Day
This is the day of the year
that some people have
been training for. The
Primal Scream Olympics
in Reykjavik kick off at
11am GMT and feature
events such as who can
spit food the farthest by
talking and chewing at
the same time. ESPN 11
every day next week.
