T
he College has
sold buildings
at Silwood
campus, name-
ly the Business Centre
and Science Park Units
A-F. This includes one
of the only large social
spaces at Silwood,
within Unit A, as well
as the Silwood gym. It
additionally plans to sell
much of the rest of the
campus in future.
These buildings will be
leased back to the College
for up to five more years.
Included in the contract is
a rolling break clause, al-
lowing either the College
or the new owners to
break the agreement with
a year’s written notice at
any time after three years
in. This means that the
direct effect on day-to-day
life will be minimised for
these buildings specifi-
cally, in the short-term.
However, certain right-
of-way paths may end up
being closed off by the
new property owners. The
College has also promised
to re-provision social
spaces and to provide
alternative support for
large-scale events such as
the famous Silfest, but has
provided no substantive
plans for how to do so.
Student represent-
atives at the Silwood
Union, commenting on
the sale, say they were
not consulted, and were
unaware of the sale until
coming across a page
on the College website.
Although the College
sent out emails about both
the opening of the sale
window in September and
an ‘open meeting’ on 5th
November for discussion,
due to an “administrative
error” they were only sent
to a subsection of Silwood
students, leaving many
Master’s students in-the-
dark, with the first com-
munication they received
being on 27th January.
Although numbers are
unclear, the list of missed
students included the
Silwood Chair, the head
student representative for
the campus, and every
other Silwood Master’s
student Felix spoke to.
The sale was completed
in December. The pur-
chasers are a real estate
investment company,
NewcoreCapital,whowill
have free reign to develop
the land as they see fit –
with the only input from
students or staff being via
the planning permission
process.
Further sales are likely
to follow, with significant
portions of the campus
not “core to the academ-
ic mission” currently
on the market. These
areas include Silwood
Lodge, which provides
accommodation for PhD
students, and the Japanese
gardens, which reps say
hold deep sentimental
value to Silwood students
and staff.
Parallels have been
drawn to the sale of St.
Mary’s, a medical campus
in Paddington, last year.
The St. Mary’s building
held high historic and sen-
timental value for medical
students and alumni, none
of whom were consulted
prior to the sale decision
announced in July last
year.
The sale decision is
particularly controversial
given that Silwood ac-
commodation is reported-
ly increasing in price next
year – according to several
Silwood staff and student
reps, although no official
figures have been posted
yet. Student representa-
tives have questioned why
rents are increasing when
the service and space
available on them will
intentionally be cut. The
College, however, has
said that they are “com-
mitted to re-provisioning
facilities, including social
and recreational spaces,
and aim to improve
them during this process
while ensuring as little
disruption as possible”,
meaning their perspective
is that service will not be
impacted.
The areas for sale at
Silwood are under the
control of the College
Endowment, a body
which manages property
portfolios for the College
with a “purely invest-
ment focus”, after being
deemed not “core to the
academic mission” in
2012. The Endowment is
controlled by Alice Gast,
the College’s President;
Muir Sanderson, the Col-
lege’s CFO; David Begg,
an Emeritus Professor of
Economics; and various
partners which provide
external oversight.
The lack of consulta-
tion with current student
representatives has been
strongly criticised, with
the Silwood Chair, Conor
Nicoll, offering a state-
ment:
“Even if imperial
wishes to brush off the
degradation of our campus
as just another business
transaction, what’s hap-
pening to Silwood is an
insult. It’s an insult to our
College to Sell Silwood’s Buildings; Reps Say they
“Weren’t Told”

The College has sold part of Silwood campus, with plans to sell significantly more, while student representatives
maintain that they weren’t consulted and were unaware of the sale
marginalised community
which is too often for-
gotten. Our marginalised
community which only
gets attention with the
sale of our property. But
Silwood will stand strong
and we will support our
community despite adver-
sity. For those who wish
to visit Silwood or study
here, I assure you, we will
welcome you with open
arms, even if there’s less
places to do so.”
The situation highlights
once again a previ-
ously-raised problem
between students and
the College: running
any consultations years
in advance, with little
subsequent effort made
to reach out to students
currently at the College,
means current students
are left frustrated and in-
the-dark. This is amplified
at Silwood, where the
majority of students are
postgraduates only here
for a year total. The Union
President said: "Students
affected by major changes
at the College deserve
to be involved from the
beginning of the decision
making process: as it
stands, proactively engag-
ing students and staff in
these matters isn't a high
enough priority."
A College spokesper-
son said:
“The community will
recognise that areas such
as the vacant Manor
House are not core to the
academic mission of the
College. However some
other facilities may be
affected and we fully
recognise the importance
of facilities for students
and staff at what is an
important campus for
the College's reputation
in ecological and con-
servation research and
education.

“We will consult with
Silwood staff and students
once we know more pre-
cisely what facilities need
to be re-provisioned – this
may vary depending on
which plots are sold and
the timetable of the sale.
“We are committed to
ensuring that outreach
and community activities
such as Bugs Day and
Silfest are continued as
we know how important
they are to staff, students,
and the local community.
We have identified ap-
propriate nearby sites on
campus for constructing a
new pond and for putting
up temporary structures
(e.g. marquees etc) for
events. Discussions about
site requirements will
occur as usual with local
organising committees
over the coming weeks as
they start to prepare for
summer events.”
