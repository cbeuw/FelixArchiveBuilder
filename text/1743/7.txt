Felix Should be Published in Chinese
I wrote this at 3 o’clock in the morning. Time for shitpost
F
elix has a rather
long history.
Founded in the
1950s as the
student newspaper, it
has undergone multiple
mutations, from being
an 8-page brochure pub-
lished once a month to its
current incarnation where
we push a 32-48-page
issue out the door once a
week. This will continue

to happen, whether you
like it or not. Felix has
a role at the heart of the
university, acting as a
curated forum for debate,
a place to write about your
club, and probably most
importantly, as a place to
test your wit against the
fiendish puzzles editors.
The devil is in the detail,
as they say, and is some-
times the solution to 6
across.
However, Felix also
has a more serious role.
Its job is to report on
the goings-on across
campus and ensure
that the student body
have some measure of
awareness about issues
concerning them. This is
important for a variety of
reasons. Knowledge of
issues allows students to
make informed choices
and make up their minds
about whether they
agree or disagree with
a given situation. This
grants them agency, an
undervalued commodity
in the modern capitalist
hellscape. Knowledge
is power, so they say.
This is all very well, but
power without execution
is pointless. Someone
fetch my Phrygian cap.
In order to turn
student awareness into
action, it is necessary
to have a tool through
which action can be
taken. This ideally
would be an effective
and decisive union.
We have ICU. Plagued
by high staff turnover,
and an apparent reality
disconnect between
the junior levels and
upper management, ICU
manages to cock up a
great many things, from
sexual assault to stall
allocation at Freshers
Fair. The only reason
they haven’t yet been
criminally incompetent
is because they have
yet to do anything at
all. Unfortunately, they
have, for a great many
years, been allowed to
get away with it. I would
attribute this to an
attitude of apathy on the
part of the student body.
Students, unless they
are very involved with
society management or
other volunteering roles,
are unlikely to encounter
the short, withered arm
of the Union. Students
simply don’t care about
the Union.
Obviously, the root
cause of this apathy
is ICU. People simply
aren’t going to use a
marzipan hammer to
drive in a nail because it
would be pointless and a
waste of sugary almond
goodness. However,
Felix must also share
a portion of the blame.
Imperial is the 6th
most
international university
in the world. Felix
and, by extension, the
Union, should reflect
this. People don’t use
things when there is a
barrier to entry to its
use. If Felix wants to be
read and remain relevant
to the entire Imperial
Community there should
be at least a few issues
published in some of
the many scripts and
languages that make
Imperial such a won-
derful place to be. At
least then, people would
know they were using a
newspaper to wipe their
arse with.
has been demonstrated
by the fact that through
Greening Imperial’s
Aviation Report we
now know the carbon
footprint associated
with travel by staff and
PhD students at Imperial
in 2018-19, and that
around 15% of the total
users in the Egencia
dataset (the travel man-
agement system used by
the college) are respon-
sible for 50% of total
emissions recorded.
There is even an option
on the procurement
system called “There
Must Be an Alternative”
(THEMBA) for staff
to offset by investing
in a charity supporting
macadamia nut farmers
in Malawi, providing
food security and
carbon sequestration in
a country with serious
deforestation and food
insecurity linked to
climate change.
Of course offsetting
is not the only means
of tackling the solution,
it takes decades for
trees to absorb the
carbon equivalent to
the purchased amount
when buying an offset.
Shifting to lower carbon
transport, for instance,
when travelling within
the UK or to Europe has
been made needlessly
complicated by the
college travel provider,
and can be an afforda-
ble option, especially
because they do not
get tax breaks for fuel.
Staff and students suffer
from lack of finances or,
more usually, time, to
purchase video-confer-
encing equipment or use
lower carbon means of
transport. Furthermore
many UK research
councils are currently
failing to approve carbon
offsets as expenses from
research grants. This
is a significant area for
the college as staff and
students are regularly
required to travel for
field work, teaching,
and conferences. As well
as avoiding high-car-
bon travel, an internal
budget and a policy of
offsetting all emissions
by default would be an
effective, low-cost, and
much needed means for
reducing Imperial Col-
lege’s carbon footprint.
It would be following
the lead of other colleges
such as Fitzwilliam
College, Cambridge,
which already offsets
all greenhouse gas
emissions resulting from
travel associated with its
activities.
Act on the social di-
mensions of the climate
crisis
Yes it is a climate
crisis, not a change, and
it is affecting people
right now, even if in
London the worst we see
are images of flooded
homes or burning
forests. It is heartening
that, although to an
extent removed to the
SRI, progress is being
made towards acting on
the social dimensions
of climate change. The
college participates in
scholarship programmes
for students from lower-
and middle-income
countries, for instance
through the Beacon
Scholarship. That said,
of the 32 current Beacon
scholarships at both
high-school and uni-
versity level, only one
is to ICL, compared to
Cambridge and Bristol,
which each have three
times as many. In the
past week, on Wednes-
day 5th
February, the
college announced a
new partnership to train
future African science
leaders and brought
together representa-
tives from a number of
African nations. Actions
like these are positive,
and a lot of hard work
goes into establishing
partnerships. It is the
right thing to do for
universities like ICL to
participate in partner-
ships with universities
in the Global South as
the social capital gives
strength in tackling
challenges for low- and
middle-income coun-
tries that are emerging
from the climate and
ecological crises. It is
also our duty. Imperial
College was founded
during the time of the
British empire, and the
surrounding area was
built up with the support
of the ruler of an empire.
Imperialism left its mark
in many nations in the
Global South far more
deeply than it did on the
identity of this college.
History aside, some of
the iron in our buildings
and the elements in the
electronics is extracted
in these countries,
where it is available and
cheapest, and often at a
cost to the health of the
workers and to the det-
riment of the local en-
vironment. And in bitter
irony, metal extraction
is one of the areas ICL
has investments into.
In 2016 for instance,
Imperial College held
just under £2 million in
“ETFS Metal Securities
Australia Ltd” which
puts the money into
precious metals trading
and exploitation through
mining with its associat-
ed by-products.
The decision of the
SRI working group is to
be announced on Friday
14th
February, the day
this article goes to print.
It has been long antici-
pated. Will the college
continue pouring money
into environmentally
and socially damaging
companies, or will it
listen to the demands of
its staff and students?
I am hopeful that the
college will make use
of the momentum and
be part of the change for
the sake of the planet.
Time is running out.
