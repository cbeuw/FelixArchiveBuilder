BOAT CLUB
alias last report of Boat Club Gazette
The College has been represented at four regattas this term,
all on the tideway. Our first success of the season was marked up
at the Vesta Dashes, held over a short course at Putney, when Bob
Lutz won Junior Senior Sculls. The second VIII made its first
appearance but could not hold Crowland R C in the Junior Senior
Eights. After a poor start, the IC rowed steadily at 40 to Crow-
land's 43, and finished § lengths down.
Mortlake was the first regatta of the season and Simon Adlam
the first to show the IC colours. He has not rowed seriously this
year in order to get some work done, and proved too unfit to get
very far. Two novice eights were
entered, the Gents and Beta. The
Gents lost to Kings College in the
first round in a rather uncom-
fortable row, while Beta beat
Staveley Schools and the Met.
Police, going through to the final.
Here they wisely chose to row in
the good water rather than in the
stream, but lost all the same, to
a good Quintin School eight.
At Putney, the improving
Gents beat the Royal Vets in a
very close race. Level at the
IC Boathouse, they just managed
to get their bows in front at the
finish. They won by two feet,
but were knocked out in the next
round by Monkton Combe.
Alpha, the IC 5th eight, had a
poor start, and did not recover,
losing by two lengths to Kings
1st VIII.
Hammersmith Regatta went
off to a promising start on May
11th. Bruno Vieri, our Junior-
Senior sculler, reported to the
start with the umpire but no
opposition. He was awarded a
row over. It later turned out that
his opponents went to the other
end of the course, due to some
doubt about the tides. In the
final, Vieri was narrowly de-
feated by J. Jennings,
In the Junior-Senior VIII's the
2nd VIII rowed well to beat
Chiswick Grammar School com-
fortably. Rowing upstream in
bad water, they drew_ away from
the school in the second half of
the course. In the final, IC
started between St. Paul's School
and Horseferry R.C.; the School
used their superior weight to ad-
vantage, and were soon in the
lead. Horseferry took half a
length off IC initially, but could
not hold this advantage, as the
2nd VIII fought back, to finish
half a length clear.
The 3rd VII, rowing Juniors,
held IBIS over most of the up-
stream course, but lost ground
in the last few hundred yards,
when rounding Harrod's wharf,
they met a strong headwind. In
the Novice Eights, Alpha
thrashed the Metropolitan Police
and went on to race Kingston
RC. Although they had one of
their best rows this season, they
could not match Kingston's
superior weight and experience,
and, after a good fight, Kingston
took a lead of two lengths.

ALLOM CUP
RETURNS
THREE-UPMAN-SHIP AT UL
Saturday, May 18th, saw ICBC
showing the flag at the Univer-
sity Boat House at Chiswick.
There were six IC entries—•first
and second eights, Alpha and the
Gents, a coxless four, and Bruno
Vieri the lone sculling entrant.
The novice crews and the four
were knocked out of the Clinker
Eights in the first heats in the
morning, but the record was
evened out by the other entrants.
In a re-row following a dead-
heat, the first eight beat U C to
regain the Allom Cup for IC, and
the second eight followed this up
by retaining the Roderick Hill
Cup.
Things looked black for UL—.
the U C crew that,was beaten by
the first eight was more or less
the U L Second VIII. The point
was brought home even more
strongly by Bruno Vieri in the
Potter Cup, who went up on his
opponent at the start, and then
proceeded to grind him into the
dust, being over a hundred yards
up at the finish. His opponent ?
None other than John Kinnear,
Captain of U L Boat Club.
SUMMER HOCKEY
IC narrowly lost their first
summer hockey match to the
Blackheath "Outcasts" 4—3 at
at Harlington last Thursday
night. The IC goals were scored
by Peters, Phillips and Dave
Hardwicke, the sub warden de-
signate of Selkirk Hall, who was
playing right half for Blackheath
at the time!
There are two more fixtures
this term, against U L U and
Kingston Grammar School.
IC CRICKET CLUB
Since only five players of last
year's 1st eleven remained at Col-
lege and over ten regular 1st X I
players had left, prospects for
this season did not look good.
There was a good turnout of
freshers at the trials and it is due
to their enthusiasm that the Club
has been able to turn out three
sides mid-week and four on
week-ends.
The 1st X I this year would
seem to have one of the strongest
bowling sides for some time,
though unfortunately the same
cannot be said of the batting, and
the fielding leaves much to be de-
sired. A feature of the attack
has been the controlled leg-spin
bowling of Reg Talbot who tops
the bowling averages (for the pre-
sent) acting as a foil for the pace-
men Bland, Flynn and Williams.
The batting which has been
strengthened from time to time
by the appearance of Sastri, has
depended mainly on Penberthy,
Topliss and Bland, supported by
Ahmed. The Club has also been
lucky to get an accomplished
wicket keeper-batsman in Eastell.
The record of the 1st X I up to
date is played 5, won 3, drawn 1
and lost 1.
Results (1st XI):
v. Middx. Hospital lost by 1
wicket.
IC 61 (Penberthy 22), Middx.
Hosp. 62—9 (Bland 4—20).
v. Eastcote. Won by 16 runs.
IC 181 (Penberthy 45, Sastri
38, Ahmed • 33), Eastcote 165
(Flynn 5—40, Sastri 4—64).
v. St. Marks and St. John won
by 88 runs.
IC 209—7 declared (Eastell 63,
Ahmed 41, Topliss 49 not out),
MarJohns 121 (Talbot 5—32,
Flynn 4—24).
v. West Indian Students match
drawn. •
IC 155 (Sastri 58), West Indians
118—8.
v. Linden Park, won by three
wickets.
Linden Park 97 (Flynn 6—48,
Talbot 3—7), IC 98—7 (Bland
35).
The 2nd X I under Satch had
mixed success, beating Gold-
smiths II and Clements, losing to
LSE II and Q M C II and draw-
ing with Albanians. The only
performance of note has been the
batting of Cleare, who carried his
bat for 55 against Clements, and
the bowling of Rice (9—34 v.
Goldsmiths, 5—25 v. Clements).
The less said about the third
eleven the better, though it must
be granted that they do not let
defeats dampen their enthusiasm.
The fourth, known as P. Steven-
son's X I , or the Chemical Ab-
stracts, have had two rousing
games with Kings 4th, losing one
and drawing the other. Turning
out in apparel of varying hues,
they have played cricket in the
true sense of the word—a certain
University soccer Purole scored
a professional 44 out of the 61 in
the second game.
We are looking forward to a
successful tour in Devon starting
on Tuesday, June 25th. Pros-
pective tourists please note. The
Sunday X I , under John Preece,
have won two games out of three.
Butt has scored 104 not out, 68
and 54 in successive knocks,
though steadily refusing to turn
out more often.
The great pity is that in a Col-
lege that regularly managed nine
rugger XVs, nine soccer XIs and
four hockey XIs, the Cricket
Club can only manage three
regular XIs—a tribute to the Ex-
amania that so many succumb to
this time of year.

Both the Wednesday and Satur-
day trials were well attended and
it looks as though IC will be
stronger this year than they have
been for some time.
The past record of friendly
matches is impressive, and it
appears that this trend will con-
tinue. It has always been in the
Cup matches that IC tennis has
stumbled, and it is hoped that the
present team, whose third pair is
close in standard to the first, will
bring the cup back to IC.
A Club play session was held
on Wednesday 8th May which
was most successful until tea time.
However, a suitable alternative
was suggested by C. Sones —ten-
pin bowling at the *' Airport
Bowl."
To sum up, the Club is flourish-
ing despite the efforts of a certain
Mr. Flynn, who has been attempt-
ing to put some of our players out
of action by a mixture of brute
force and ignoranaj. It is hoped
that support will continue despite
the imminent exams. No doubt
the Club will be seen through by
the old stalwarts, whose numbers
include the' never-aging Dr.
Glosser.
