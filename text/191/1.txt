Seriously though, your reporter thinks that this year's Carnival
executive, under the leadership of chairman John R. Maddison,
has done a grand job. The problem of raising more than last
year's total of £1,125 has been tackled with the kind of initiative
that one would rarely expect in a College of this sort. In addi-
tion, the public image of the College in the eyes of the Kensington
populace has been carefully fostered so that next year an even
higher target can be aimed for.
The sky now seems to be the
limit, provided we apply as much
imagination in future years as has
obviously gone into this year's
However, while we praise this
year's executive, let not be as-
sumed that we can now sit back

A n IC sports team has finally
defeated C E M , partly avenging
the defeats suffered by the Rug-
ger, Hockey and Golf Clubs. A l -
though the first pair, Richardson
and Dauman, lost to the opposing
first pair, the match was won
comfortably 7—2.
The team :
1st Pair—J. Richardson, J.
Dauman, won 2.
2nd Pair—C. oames, M . Cowp-
land, won 3.
3rd Pair—Ft. Tsou, B. Anketell,

satisfied. Mr. Maddison himself
is the first to point out weaknesses
in the organisation and at this
minute is writing a concise report
to assist future chairmen.
An important aspect of this
year's Carnival is the amount of
money collected from people out-
side the College. Complaints
levelled at our previous Carni-
vals have often brought out the
point that most of the money
came from students. This year,
while the students did all the
work (e.g., pushing a four-poster
bed to Piccadilly, and running for
forty-eight hours around Hyde
Park), the people in the street
were made to contribute hand-
somely.
We were, of course, fortunate
for the most part with the wea-
ther. This enabled a good deal
of publicity to be effected in the
College itself. The Carnival stall
became a centre of life for a few
days, and Mr. Acker Bilk's fami-
liar and melodious tones became
even more familiar, if perhaps
less melodious, as the week pro-
gressed. Saturday dawned—per-
haps " exploded " could best be
substituted for "dawned." The
float procession appeared in
Prince Consort Road shortly after
noon to the shouts, screams,
tears and expostulations of the
students, staff and Metropolitan
Police. These latter making
overtures to some of the former
with what appeared to be threats
of cancelling the procession if it
didn't start on time. Obviously
no notice was taken of this, since
it was nearly half past twelve
when the lorries finally got under
way. The procession was; how-
ever, eminently successful, raising
nearly £250—about two and a
half times the amount made last
year.
The fete in Prince's Gardens
was an equal success. Miss Alma
Cogan had kindly consented to
open it and she appeared on the
scene, and was introduced by the
chairman, to the cheers and yells
of her myriad of adoring fans.
She was delightfully and taste-
fully dressed for the occasion in
a pink, flowered ensemble.
One notable feature this year
was the disappearance of the
marquee, but the reason for this
was supplied by Mr. Maddison
who, when criticised about it, ex-
plained that, since the weather
was fine, there was no need for
a tent, and had it rained, there
would have been nobody in the
gardens to take shelter anyway-
commendable logic. So to Satur-
day evening. It might be thought
that the successes of the proces-
sion and fete would be difficult
