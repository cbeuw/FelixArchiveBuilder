COUNCIL MINUTES-—
continued
and methods of obtaining the
minimum amount of queuing in
all the refectories. It was during
the last that Mr. Phillips asked
for a choice of cheeses in Weeks
Hall; the matter would be in-
vestigated. The Carnival Organ-
isers were worried about the lack
of contact between them and
Council, and after some discus-
sion Mr. Oldfield proposed that a
member of Council should be
elected to sit on the Carnival
Committee. Mr. White's motion
that the Chairman of the Carni-
val Committee should sit on
Council was however preferred,
and carried. This would involve
constitutional changes requiring
favourable decisions at two sub-
sequent Union meetings.
The Silwood Park Committee
are worried about the accommo-
dation and facilities for students
at Silwood. There would appear
to be far too many people in too
little space, and despite repeated
representation, the position seems
to be getting worse, with more
students being accepted for
courses there than can be con-
veniently accommodated. Much
serious thought was given to the
matter, with the conclusion that
something must and would be
done.
The most interesting report
was from the SCC. Mr. Pearson
informed Council that the Flat
Earth Society had been carefully
considered. Will it stand on its
feet ? Is this proposal to form
the Society a serious one ? Ap-
parently the majority of Council
believed that it was. We shall
see. . . . Also interesting was the
formation of the Communist
Society. This would differ from
the Marxist Forum in its rather
more active, as opposed to theo-
retical work. The Marxist Forum
would naturally be liquidated.
McCarthy Gardiner suggested
that according to his informed
sources, the 25 per cent, of the
listed members of the American
Communist Party were members
of the FBI.
Finally, Council moved on to
AOB and the dicey question of
a fruit machine. Someone had
written to Mr. Slater suggesting
that installation of a one-armed
bandit in the Union would be an
excellent way of raising money.
(The machine would have to be
installed at above pocket height.)
The rules of the Union appar-
ently forbid gambling on the
premises, but these could presum-
ably be changed. Mr. Phillips
mentioned the money raising
qualities of a fruit machine that
had been installed in his golf
club, and narrowly escaped being
struck by a misguided flying
sandwich. The verdict was no,
however. Still, even if there is to
be no gambling in the bar. a
drink can't hurt—the Meeting
closed at 7.10 p.m.
H E N R Y M O O R E IN LONDON
By D. Farrell
Until quite recently, sculpture
had never received any serious
enthusiasm in England, perhaps
because the preoccupation with
"Empire and Glory" demanded
work on the Graeco Roman
pattern which combined the
worst aspects of those two cul-
tures to produce something best
forgotten.
Henry Moore is the first crea-
tive artist in England since the
nineteenth century painters to
achieve an international reputa-
tion and his work can be seen
in many places in London. He
has an immensely powerful im-
pact which it is difficult and
somewhat irritating to have to
put into words, which at best are
a pallid, dead reflection. Of the
half-dozen places where his work
can be seen, the Tate has per-
haps the finest and most repre-
sentative selection. The " Re-
clining Figure," which was com-
missioned for the UNESCO
building in Paris is a good intro-
duction to Moore's work, giving
a truer account of the total
human situation than any strictly
realistic classical sculpture could
ever achieve.
Moore's vision is of man inex-
tricably bound up in nature, liv-
ing as part of the collective
whole. A tragic view of man
alienated from himself pours out
of the figure in two parts. A
work like this would be the best
manifesto for the revolution
preached by the Bishop of Wool-
wich.
Moore has inspired many of
our younger sculptors to great
achievements, and the " School"
of British Sculpture over which
his influence is enormous will be
seen in Battersea Park this sum-
mer. This is the first major ex-
hibition of British sculpture since
1949, and will be a mere 9d. bus
ride from College.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
