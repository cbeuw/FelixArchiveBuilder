College Clubs have long experi-
enced difficulty in obtaining
transport for their functions, due
to insurance premiums for stu-
dent drivers and prohibitive hire
charges. The Mountaineering,
Caving and Sub Aqua Clubs have
for some time now been looking
into the possibilities of acquiring
a vehicle to help them out of their
problems. The matter was put
officially to the three clubs early

If you divide the population into two groups—those
who take T H E TIMES and those who don't—you find
this: those who don't take T H E TIMES are in the great
majority. Those who do are either at the top in their
careers, or are confidently headed there.
T H E TIMES both by its seniority in experience and
by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,
naturally commends itself to successful people. There
is no high level conference, no board meeting, no top
executive's^private office into which T H E TIMES is
not apt to be taken.
This choice of a newspaper by people who get on is
indisputable.* In which of the two groups do you
place yourself?

THE TIMES
* STUDENTS AND THE TIMES: As a student
you can have The Times for 2id. Write for details to
the Circulation Manager, The Times, London, E.C.4
in February this year, and was
accepted favourably. Three
members of the Caving Club put
up £120, and the three clubs
became the proud possessors of a
30cwt. Austin Van.
With the help of the Union, a
policy was arranged which
avoided the previous insurance
difficulties. A personal accident
policy has also been arranged for
any students who may travel in
the van.
The vehicle itself has been
modified with seats and luggage
racks, and is maintained by the
three owner clubs. By a gentle-
men's agreement, the three indi-
viduals who originally put for-
ward the money are being paid
back in proportion to the num-
ber of the times the vehicle is
used by them. The initial gamble
seems to be paying off well, and
in a short time, the vehicle will
be paid for, by funds that would
otherwise have gone to some hire
firm for hire of Doormobiles.
Enterprise does not finish there,
however—rumour has it that
soon the Austin may have a baby
brother.

students from abroad who are
working in or just visiting

students from 35 different coun-
tries joined the Club, and this

varied and ambitious, we expect
greater numbers of students to
join.
Will Y O U be here this sum-
mer? Then why not join. Mem-

had eaten.
An abortive attempt on the
World Potato Crisp Eating record
ended last Friday when ironic
cheering indicated that the con-
tender had not been equal to the
task. Four first year civils set out
to prove that thirty bags of crisps
could be eaten in less than 59
minutes. Three dropped out
when they fell behind schedule
but the fourth ate crisply on. He
reached twenty bags ahead" of
schedule, and eating well; how-
ever by the twenty-third the
the colour of his face indicated
that his attempt was almost over,
and when the ring of spectators
moved sharply backward, another
gallant contender had fallen by
the wayside.

DEBATE
G U I L D S - M I N E S —
David Watson
On Tuesday last at lunch time
some seventy odd people assem-
bled in the concert hall to see
Guilds and Mines meet in verbal
battle over the motion " that this
House urges the immediate imple-
mentation of the proposals con-
tained in the Beeching report"!
Tony Berry opened for the
proposition (Guilds) with a com-
petent historical survey of the
development of our railway
system—an account which would
have been all the more impressive
if he had been able to harness
closely to his present end his
undoubted mastery of fact, As it
was Roy Gardiner (Mines) was
able to accept almost all that Mr.
Berry said. The crux of the
argument, he emphasized, was
whether or not to impliment the
proposals now. Martin Stacey
and David Reich spoke for
Guilds; the former, basing his
case on the economic facts of life
in the 1960's, gave his accustomed
polished performance, while Mr.
Reich spoke competently.
George Manson, representing
the Celtic fringe and (incident-
ally) Mines, painted a dismal
picture of a railless Highlands.
No industry, no buses, no roads,
no railways. What were the
people (who apparently were not
there either) to do? Nigel Kel-
land went straight to the heart of
the matter—' Statistics don't lie,
only the people who use them'
—and made some telling points.
Alan Morden summed up for
Mines; the railways should not be
dismantled till the real economics
of the situation were understood.
Chris Liddle was unconvinced—
the country could not afford to let
things slide any longer.
Mines won the motion and
Guilds the debate-^a fair result.
It was a creditable affair for all
concerned, especially considering
the short notice at which things
were arranged. With a little more
of the thrust and parry of live
debate, the next one will be even
better.
