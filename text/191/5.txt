CARNIVAL
Continued from page I
to follow up in the evening, but
were were in for a suprise. The
Union had been decorated in fes-
tive mood and around eight'
o'clock the crowds began to
filter, nay flood, into the building.
It became apparent that the lively
advertising campaign to which
the Carnival had treated itself
was going to pay dividends. A
conservative estimate put the
numbers in the building at twelve
hundred—surely the biggest event
of this sort ever held at Imperial.
It should be noted at this point
that many of the people in the
Union found themselves there
without having paid the entrance
fee, which is not, it must be said,
a reflection of the general moral
attitude at I.C.? However, de-
spite this, the evening was a tre-
mendous success, due in no small
measure to the work put in by
the M.C.'s who "gave away a good
many spot prizes and worked ex-
tremely hard. Perhaps if as
much work and imagination had
been put into Saturday night
Hops, then these would be better
attended. The selection of music
was good, and of special note
must be the rock group in the
upper refectory.
In all, therefore, we cannot
complain that this year's Carni-
val has been one which will be
soon forgotten. Although it will
be some time before the accounts
are finally closed, it seems that
this year's profits are some 80 per
cent, up on last year's.

CROWDED CONDITIONS AT SILWOOD PARK
NUMBERS UP N E X T Y E A R
Recently the Field Station and its inhabitants have been under
discussion in union and college committees. Some details given
here may be informative.
The superficial features of Silwood can be seen on any Touch-
stone poster and are in some ways the best aspect of it. It is 25
miles from I.C. Union, on the Virginia Water to Ascot road, and
consists principally of the larger parts of the Botany and Zoology
postgraduate departments crammed into Silwood house itself and
the smaller Ashurst Lodge nearby.
There is also a Meteorology botanists about to take their
department in the buildings of
Silwood Farm ,a number of Ex-
W.D. buildings used by visiting
surveying courses and for storage,
and now the early stages of a
Nuclear Reactor.
The root of our problems is
the overcrowding of the Labora-
tory and particularly Hostel ac-
commodation. There are now 42
permanent resident postgraduates
at Silwood, compared with 27 in
1959 and the only recent increase
in hostel accommodation has
been the recent use of of Hut 6
(a temporary building previously
used only in summer) which
houses 6 people, the remainder
being " shoe horned " into occu-
pied rooms in the house.
A recent survey gives the total
bedroom space per resident as 98
square feet (18 of which is bed).
One room has four inhabitants
and some are so small that the
wardrobe and dressing table are
kept outside. In many rooms the
roof slopes, reducing the volume
considerably.
Accommodation for temporary
courses varies with the numbers
involved from single rooms in
SOUTH SIDE OPENS
The great day finally dawned-—Saturday, May 11th, and the
two East end South Side Halls opened for students. Not that the
two Halls were completed—carpets were still to be laid, kitchens
and launderettes were still not working, some rooms were defi-
cient in lamps, bulbs, number plates, etc., but beds, water, etc., known
collectively as the bare essentials, were there. Some 240 students
moved in with their goods, chattels, and other impedimenta, those of
us who have a tendency towards accumulating property finding the
move and the subsequent disposal of property rather tedious, if not
downright impossible. The rooms cannot be described as over-sup-
plied with cupboard space, and lack of hooks on doors only serves
to emphasise the cramped hanging space for clothes.
Various other small annoying
- — — j— o
details cropped up, such as the
bookshelves which are too small
to take anything bigger than a
paper back, and suitcase storage
space above the fitted wardrobes,
which is just too small to take
average size trunks, with the re-
sult that these have to be stowed
on landings. It would be petty,
however, to let these small points
obscure the fact that South Side
will provide, when finished, ac-
commodation for 384 students
who would otherwise live in digs.
Whether the staircase plan should
be followed in the other halls
which will someday be built
around Princess Gardens, is, how-
ever, doubtful. Anyone who has
experienced communal life on the
corridors of Beit is immediately
struck by the rather more se-
cluded and cloistered-atmosphere
| of the solitary staircases with
their rather isolated cells ar-
ranged rather in groups of fours,
insulated from each other by
double glass doors. Perhaps
when the lounges become more
popular, there will be some more
mixing, but at first sight, it does
seem that the system succeeds
rather in isolating residents than
in throwing them together.
The lounges on the continuous
service floors are airy and
spacious, and excellent for par-
ties, as was proved at an un-
official house \. arming that took
place on last Friday evening.
An interesting feature of the
building are the lifts, which
showed a tendency to stop (i.e.,
jam) in between levels, but this,
like other snags, will no doubt,
be ironed out in time.
finals, to army Nissen huts with a
bed and coathook for each man,
for large surveying courses. I am
assured that the rats in these
buildings have left in disgust and
the chickens keep to their own
superior accommodation nearby.
Flats, etc., nearby are very
scarce, and if available are used
by married students.
Ldunge and Common Room
space works out at 19 square
feet per resident, but these facili-
ties are used by Union members
living out, in the day-time, thus
increasing overcrowding. In our
T V . lounge there are 22 chairs,
18 facing the T.V—thus fewer
than half the residents can see the
set at a time, except by standing,
Use of this lounge is now re-
stricted to permanent Students
and summer term courses from
huts, with furniture, for third year
Zoology and Botany depart-
ments, since Silwood is part of
R.C.S. Union.
Comparable figures from I.C
Union will probably show a
worse situation, but the Silwood
resident, who can't sit in his com-
mon room, has to resort to his
bed, his lab, or the grass outside
in the rain.
The alternative is to go out.
London is 1£ hours away (7/- re-
turn fare, one bus per hour, last
one 11.30 p.m.). There are pubs
nearby and a coffee bar (5 miles)
and the village cinema, but even
the wildest spirits stay in most
nights for lack of cash.
In winter the roads are dan-
gerous to our cars, which won't
start, as there is only covered
shelter for half of them, also the
last buses may be cancelled with-
out warning.
We have, of course, the beauty
of the countryside to console us.
There is probably less loneliness
and the food is better than at
South Kensington—which is just
as well, there being no alternative
but the pub, the Transport Cafe
or limited cooking facilities.
There will be a net increase of
ten people next year—we are
agitating for a new hostel, but
with scant success.
