Editorial Comment
Dae to an arrangement made last year with the agency supply-
ing Felix with adverts., there is only advertising for two issues of
Felix in the Summer Term. Each issue of Felix'costs about £50 to
produce; this is just about covered by advertising revenue on an
average issue plus what is made on sales. An issue without adverts,
must be subsidised to the tune of £20 to £30, depending on the
number of pages and number printed. It may be possible to find
sufficient cash to produce another issue this term, so as to com-
plete the record of Union events with an issue dealing with the
elections, but in case this is not possible, the Editor would like to
put on record now his gratitude to the Felix staff for the work that
they have put in this year, "Staff" must include not only those
whose names appear on this page, but also all those who have
submitted articles at the Editor's request, especially those connected
with the series of profiles. A special vote of thanks is due to the
much maligned Mr. Phillips (of Council fame), who originally sug-
gested the series, and who has been instrumental in keeping it going.
The Editor has indeed been fortunate in his staff, and he hopes
that any still interested in Felix next session will give the next Editor
the same sterling service.

FELIX FRESHERS DAY
ISSUE!
It has been customary in the
past to bring out an issue of
FELIX on fresher's day, and this
practice will be continued next
year. Newly elected Captains or
residents wishing to publicise
their club or society in this par-
ticular issue are invited to submit
articles by the end of this term,
or during the vacation to: The
Editor, c/o Imperial College
Union.
Anyone interested in joining
the Felix staff for next year in
any capacity, is also invited to
see either the present Editor, or
the Advertising Manager.
Congratulations to the Carni-
val Committee — they collected
£2,000 approx for Freedom from
Hunger or was it War on Want ?
Well, I'm sure that it was a
worthy charity, whatever it was!
I wonder if Asit knows which
charity we are supporting? He
wasn't at the Carnival Fete,
although Alma Cogan dreamt
that she had seen him. In fact
the only Carnival function that he
went to was the International
Evening, which happened to fol-
low the Rector's Sherry Party.
Seriously chaps, the Pres» is do-
ing a grand job.
Surely the Masked Festival in
the Union was the best social at
IC for some time. Let us hope
that it will have done something
to put our hops back on the map
again. (This should in no way
be construed as a criticism of
the Chairman of Ents.) It was
a success because it was different.
I hope that next year's Entertain-
ments Committee will not be
afraid to try something different
occasionally. People do tend to
get tired of Carnivals, and com-
mon or garden Saturday Hops.
Stynx, however, was no credit
to the College; it really was scraps
ing the barrel. The Rector was
quite justified in objecting to his
name being associated with this
filthy rubbish. Surely IC can pro-
duce a Carnival Magazine that
we can be proud of.. The first
rate material used in the Carnival
revue showed that there is talent
in the College capable of produc-
ing humour without crudity.
The last Council meeting was a
farce. Lacking any positive
direction from the Chairman, who
didn't seem to care what was
decided, so long as it was decided
quickly, the meeting was dragged
down to a purile level by the
buffoonery of certain individuals
who were allowed to prattle on
quite aimlessly. Thank goodness
they voted against a fruit machine
in the Union, but surely they
clanged on the Carnival Organiser
issue. Apparently, the poor chap
doesn't want to sit on Council
anyway, he could be invited along
to the meetings dealing with mat-
ters concerning him, or better
still, a member of Council could
be elected to sit on the Carnival
Committee. If they haven't' the
time to take an active part in run-
ning the Union, they should not
be sitting on Council anyway. The
way things are going, the Editors
of Phoenix and Felix will be on
Council, and that will still leave
the Hyde Park Road Relay
Organisers out.
Election time is here again, and
all the King Makers are at work
plotting the destiny of the Union.
I've heard at least six candidates
for President mentioned in Union
circles. Is it just possible that
we will have an election this year?
I bet that it is all arranged before-
hand again, with all but one
chickening out before Joint Coun-
cil.
The SCC Chairmanship is being
contested anyway, though the rest
of the Committee seems to have
been more or less arranged by
that very active Society that is in
the process of changing its name.
I wonder if that chap who seems
to be keeping a constant vigil by
the nominations board. soliciting
for seconders will get the Chair-
manship?
The A C C took a hammering
from Pearson in his 1894 Council
Meeting Minutes in the last issue
of Felix. His dismal prediction
that the Debating Society will be
defunct by then may well be ful-
filled if the present trend con-
tinues. After a very uninspired
year, the Society is having dif-
ficulty in finding a Chairman for
next session. It is about time
somebody took over, and put the
Society where it belongs—the top
Society in the College. There are
too many societies in the College
without a common goal. The
Debating Society could pull them
all together by organising some
controversial debates between
the " n " political societies, the
" n plus 1" religious societies, and
the "n plus n" national societies.
To gain in strength they must
have a very much more integrated
programme, with some co-opera-
tion between the "rival" factions.
Forming new bodies, like the
Flat Earth Society constituted at
the last Council Meeting, is not
the answer to the problem that
faces the Social Clubs at IC.
Council Meeting
May 13th
B. Hooper
The, Council Meeting of the
13th May was distinctly different
from many of the others held
earlier this session. No hard
words bouncing around the room,
reflecting from the hot plates in
the upper refectory—true, a sand-
wich flight under the guidance of
thee Mining Section Council, but
that was all.
First event of note was found
under " Correspondence," when
it was discovered that Council
had been selected as a random
sample in a survey on SEX con-
ducted by the B M A ; details of
habits, and cohabits were re-
quested, and the Psychological
aspect was also thrown in for
good measure. (Did your mother
work when you were a child ?)
Sources of information on the
subject were required —• books,
other children, etc.? Names and
addresses were not asked for, but
what about the S.W.7 postmark ?
The Executive Report gave
rise to discussions on the pro-
posed Central Site, liaison be-
tween Council and the Carnival,
