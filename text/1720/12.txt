Witnessing Life on the Frontline of Climate Change

b r o a d c a s t e d
the highly
anticipated documentary
“Climate Change: The
facts”. Needless to say,
it was one of the most
devastating hours of
my entire easter holiday
(really putting revision
into perspective). Hosted
by the trusted veteran, sir
David Attenborough, this
documentary presented
the alarming and formi-
dable consequences of
global warming exceeding
1.5 degrees.
The problem with
global warming for
many, is that it seems to
be such an abstract and
overwhelming topic that
we can’t quite get the
grasp of it. There seems
to be too much infor-
mation floating around,
with mixed opinions and
solutions from a multitude
of angles. Nonetheless,
younger generations have
shown strong concerns
and proactivity in the
recent months, through
events such as the
climate strikes across the
globe and the extinction
rebellion in London. It
seems timely that BBC
has broadcasted this com-
prehensive documentary,
‘rousing call to arms’, as
stated by the Guardian.
It tackles some of the
greatest threats of climate
change - heatwaves in
forests that have led to the
massacre of the Australian
flying fox; icebergs built
over thousands of years
collapsing in a matter of
seconds; regions of land
once inhabited now sub-
merged, forcing ‘climate
refugees’ to seek escape;
wildfires in California
burning down entire
communities along with
its families.
Our planet is quite
literally falling apart.
I believe that the
problem with us as
students studying in
London, living our day
to day lives, is that it
becomes almost too easy
to dismiss everything
happening thousands of
miles away. If we aren’t
the ones suffering, we
seem to continue putting
it off. Which is why, this
documentary is so painful
to watch – but should be
mandatory for everyone.
Sir Attenborough’s dire
tone presents shocking
statistics about the reality
of our planet, which,
narrated over footage of
grim landscapes taken
from across the globe,
merge in an effort to cry
out to our ethos, pathos
and logos. When the
documentary presents
to you the stark reality
of real people and tragic
climate change.
Nonetheless, the film is
not all doom-and-gloom.
The last 20 minutes of
the documentary offers
a glimpse of hope: if we
take serious action in the
coming years it is possible
to mitigate some of the
most adverse damages
of climate change. By
shedding light on 16-year-
old Greta Thunberg and
how she ignited a youth
revolution against climate
change, we as audience
are urged to believe that if
she can do it, any one of us
can too make a difference.
An interesting
approach to the problem
is presented through the
rapid growth of renewable
energy development –
solar panels, windmills,
and even electronic aero-
planes (though far in the
future). The question is
whether or not all this can
make the necessary dif-
ference before a looming
deadline.
It seems ironic that
the man whose career
was born of sharing the
wonders of nature to the
public, is now having to
