More than Human? Stephanie Dinkins
AI: More than Human sees collaboration between cutting edge researchers at DeepMind (MIT) and a wide range
of artists including Stephanie Dinkins.

S
tephanie Dinkins’
eureka moment
came as she stood
face-to-face with
BINA48, a black female
robot residing in a first-
floor office in Vermont.
The opportunity was
thanks to the work of the
Terasem Foundation, a
group dedicated to testing
the limits of uploading
a mind into a computer.
Faced with “the only
black female robot on the
planet”, Dinkins felt that
her cyber companion’s
answers to questions
about race and gender
seemed incongruent with
the experience of a black
woman in 21st century
America.
Technology, often host
to futuristic fantasy, also
reminds us of very present
concerns. For Dinkins,
there is a tangible fear
that “AI and technology
will start homogenising us
… boiling us down to the
mean”. How can we create
sentient entities meant to
operate in cosmopolitan
communities when the
creators are far from cos-
mopolitan? Is the answer
for AI entities to only be
encoded by people from
their ‘community’? Ac-
cording to Dinkins, “pro-
grammers require lots and
lots of information and
interviews and contact,
to appreciate some of the
nuances of a culture”.
Thus, the path forward
lies not in the subjective
experience of whoever
writes the code, but
education and exposure
to different communities.
“We’re not just providing
facades,” Dinkins is eager
to emphasise.
With in this drive to un-
derstand others in order to
create a synthetic identity
comes “ideas of empathy,
compassion, ethical
stances towards each
other”, says Dinkins.
Perhaps, one is allowed
to hope, planning for the
future can help to heal the
enduring ignorance and
misunderstandings of the
present.
Based on her experi-
ence and art engaging with
authenticity and agency,
and with the generous
funding of Pioneer Works
Tech Lab and others,
Dinkins has created Not
The Only One, or N’TOO.
The project is a multigen-
erational memoir of three
generations of women
in her family (spanning
almost a century), as told
by a custom deep-learning
AI. The AI has been fed
numerous interviews
with these women and
continues to gather new
knowledge from interac-
tions with the public. The
idea of learning through
exposure to the real world
is reminiscent of Micro-
soft’s AI chatter bot, Tay,
which enjoyed a life-span
of 16 hours during which
it evolved from a naïve
online sentience into, as
Dinkins puts it, a “crazy,
vile, racist, homophobic,
xenophobic thing”. A
bitter reminder that online
discourse is perhaps not
the best way to raise a
new-bornAI. When I raise
this fear with Dinkins,
she concedes that she
provides only a founda-
tion upon which the AI
builds its own sentience.
However, to follow her
family traditions, N’TOO
is designed not to ‘hear’
crude or vulgar terms. In
doing so, she treads a fine
line between ‘organic’
growth of the AI and
cultural limits.
The tradition of oral
history is deeply rooted in
older cultures. The griot,
found in present-day
West African tribes, is a
historian, story-teller and
vocal artist. As Francis
Bebey, Cameroonian
writer, wrote in African
Music: A People’s Art, the
griot is “a living archive
of the people’s traditions”,
one who receives news
and information from
the community. Though
Dinkins is reluctant to lay
claim to the griot heritage
and title, she recognises
a curious similarity
between her family’s oral
tradition and N’TOO’s
essence: “things are verbal
… they’re somewhat
encoded.” While griots
are bound by mortal
limitations and lifespans,
N’TOO may become what
Dinkins dubs “almost the
active griot with a digital
memory”. However, the
similarities end there.
The human griot offers
broad sweeping lessons in
human nature, while the
interpersonal conversa-
tions recorded by N’TOO
old data”? For Dinkins, the
movement to “have more
people of colour in the top
ranks helping to write the
code, write the algorithms,
and control some of the
ways they’re being used
or sold to other systems”
brings both social and
economic benefits. If you
educate communities
about algorithms using
non-biased data, you get
what Dinkins heralds as
“better outcomes”. For
instance, a ProPublica
report into machine bias
revealed how algorithms
based on zipcodes charged
Asian-Americans more,
on average, for online
SAT tutoring. However,
this extends beyond
“small social justice …
predict when technology
will reach the feared
singularity, when it even-
tually surpasses human
intelligence. She defers to
the judgement of greater
minds: “we have 25-50
years to get this right”.
Such a deadline is fast
approaching, and raises
vital questions: “how do
we prepare ourselves, and
how do we prepare it?” A
technology that is made
by all, for all.
As the interview draws
to a close, I ask her for her
advice for anyone looking
to be involved in program-
ming, whether as an artist
(like her) or as a program-
mer. She counsels young
people to “remember
to bring your whole
self”, a holistic approach
involving both skill-set
and identity. Deploring
adherence to the status
quo as “complacent”, she
recommends “remaining
flexible, mentally and in
the modalities you use.”
We stand on an exis-
tential precipice. Climate
change catastrophe looms
heavy on the horizon.
Should we survive,
N’TOO stands as a salient
reminder that our histo-
ries, as well as our futures,
deserve protection in the
digital Eden that follows.

Dinkins’ work extends
beyond her most recent
project. She has founded
Project Al Khwarizmi, a
community-based project
in Brooklyn that brings
coding and data to com-
munities of colour. As we
rapidly immerse society
in technology, Dinkins
reminds us that “our lives
are being bounced off
algorithms all the time”.
From social media feeds
to criminal justice, we are
unknowingly controlled
by digital mechanisms.
But what happens when
“this system is based on
it’s about the way we
decide to live as humans”,
