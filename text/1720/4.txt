Road Festival 2019
T
his year, staff
and students at
Imperial College
will see big
changes to the annual
Imperial Festival. With
the 200-year anniversary
of the births of Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert
fast approaching, this
year the festival will be
a collaborative effort for
the first time. 19 other
cultural institutions in
the area, all of which are
members of the Exhibiton
Road Cultural Group,
have come together with
Imperial to bring The
Great Exhibition Road
Festival 2019.
"We're very lucky on
this campus to have such
a unique position where
there's the world's leading
museums on the road",
said Vicky Brightman,
speaking to Felix. In her
position as Head of Public
Engagement, Vicky looks
after the festival and is
particularly concerned
with areas around how
Imperial can engage the
wider society with its
research and also how
Imperial can enable its
staff and students to do
more and better public en-
gagement. Explaining the
idea behind the festival,
Vicky said, "let's have a
think about how we can
work collaboratively to
raise the profile of the
area to lots of new audi-
ences because it is a really
special area - the home
of arts and sciences in
the UK really, especially
London."
The festival, which
is planned for 28th
- 30th
June and will see vehic-
ular access to Exhibition
Road blocked due to
it being closed off, is
partly inspired by The
Great Exhibition of 1851.
Prince Albert championed
this and wanted to have
an exhibition to show the
world how advanced we
were. Six million people,
an astonishing number at
the time, visited this first
exhibition and the profits
are still administered by
The Royal Commission
for the Great Exhibition of
1851, one of the partners
for this year's festival.
"200 years on, we thought
it was a great opportunity
to celebrate that vision
Albert had", Vicky added.
That vision being, if we
were to fuse the arts and
sciences and collaborated,
everything would be a lot
better and richer for it. At
a time when people were
still thinking that there
was a rift between arts and
science, Prince Albert was
quite the visionary and his
desire to see the profits
of the exhibition used to
fund this area ('Albertop-
olis') is why many of the
partnered institutions are
here today. Vicky told
Felix: "What was really
important to everybody
was showing what the
richness of collaboration
can bring".
The festival is also
about attracting new au-
diences. Imperial, along
with many of the partnered
museums, is aware that
sometimes it is "preaching
to the converted" - i.e.
people that already love
science or the arts. Vicky
addressed this, saying:
"We want to keep those
people coming because
they might study and
work in the area as well
and that's really important
but, actually, there's loads
of local communities that
don't see this as the place
for them. One of the other
main aims of the festival
was to work a bit harder
on community engage-
ment. We're particularly
trying to engage people in
North Kensington." As a
result, there are five or six
community engagement
projects taking place
before the festival that
will have an output at the
festival which can be cele-
brated much more widely.
As well as working
hard on community en-
gagement, all the partners
are really excited about
engaging eachother's au-
diences. Commenting on
this, Vicky added: "The
people who come to our
Imperial Festival aren't
the same as those that go

19 other cultural institutions in the area have come together with Imperial to bring
The Great Exhibition Road Festival 2019 // Imperial College London
to the V&A [Victoria &
Albert Museum]. We want
to engage a really wide
variety of people with our
research and involve them
in it so working in part-
nership gives us access
to lots more people that
perhaps wouldn't come to
the Imperial Festival and
we'd never reach".
Of course, the logistics
of collaborating with 19
cultural partners imposes
some contraints on flexi-
bility and has resulted in
a date change to Imperial
Festival, which typically
takes place in April/ May,
as reported in last week's
issue of Felix. Vicky
revealed: "Finding a date
that everybody would be
happy with was a very
challenging aspect. The
date certainly wasn't
perfect for us." With that
being said, College has
done a commendable job
at ensuring the number
of students affected is
quite low. In response
to students that are con-
cerned or confused about
the changes, particularly
those that have to move
out of student halls early,
compared to previous
years, Vicky said: "I'd
ask them to look at the

Engagement, Vicky
Brightman, to get

Festival 2019
FAQs as a first point-of-
call. All the Hall wardens
have been informed and
they know what to do if
somebody comes to them
so tell someone, whether
it's your lecturer or a
Hall warden. The Student
Hub and various Campus
Services teams have been
amazing. Our students
are so important for the
festival."
The importance of
the student body to the
smooth running of the
festival can't be stressed
enough, with at least 200
staff and student volun-
teers each year. There are
140 research teams taking
part in the festival, there-
fore postgraduate students
are especially crucial.
"Those research teams are
always a mixture of staff
and student; they deliver
so much of the content."
Vicky noted: "There
aren't many opportunities
where everybody comes
together and feels like
they're all part of the same
institution and the same
team". However, this close
collaboration between
staff and students at the
festival engenders a sense
of community seldom
offered at Imperial.
