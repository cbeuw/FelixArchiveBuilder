T
he month of April
marked a historic
moment for the
financial markets.
The Saudi Arabian Oil
Company (Saudi Aramco)
had its debut international
bond issuance. A titan in
the world of oil and gas,
whose pulse is closely
monitored by financial
markets as a proxy to the
health of one the world’s
favourite commodities,
Saudi Aramco has raised
$12bn from the $100bn
received in orders, the
largest amount ever seen
in an emerging market
bond deal. Investment
banks JP Morgan and
Morgan Stanley were the
joint global coordinators
for the deal,
On April 10th, 2019,
the secretive state-backed
corporation released a
469-page prospectus,
giving investors a glimpse
into the finances of the
oil giant, which have
previously been kept
secret for three-quarters of
the century. The numbers
confirmed rumours of the
corporation’s profitability.
The year of 2018 brought
in a net income of
$111.1bn, dwarfing that
of rival Royal Dutch Shell
five-fold and double that
of Apple, leading some
cashflows standing at 4.5
× larger than gross debt.
Most energy rivals have
a ratio of less than 1.
The issuance follows the
Crown Prince’s desire for
Aramco to take on a larger
presence in the global
financial markets and
leverage its robust balance
sheet to fuel the PIF. An
eagerly awaited initial
public offering (IPO) of a
5% stake in Aramco was
delayed indefinitely last
year, after disagreements
surrounding its $2tn
valuation. The IPO would
have seen $100bn flowing
into the PIF’s coffers.With
the kingdom still reeling
from controversy over the
killing of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi, an article
by the Financial Times
considered the political
implications of the deal,
framing it as a way for the
kingdom to reingratiate
itself with global
investors. This comes at a
time when global scrutiny
of some of the kingdoms
more controversial actions
, which have left allies and
investors nervous, is at a
high.
Aramco’s financial
health, low debt to
cash flows, geographic
advantage and market
leading position has
earned it credit worthiness
ratings of A1 and A+ by
rating agencies Moody’s
and Fitch respectively,
falling short of the
coveted triple AAA rating
awarded to the highest
quality of debt issuers. An
entity’s credit worthiness
determines the likelihood
of the debtor defaulting on
the loan obligation, i.e.,
the likelihood of Aramco
being unable to repay
the holders of its bonds.
The reason being, the
corporation’s close ties
with the sovereign and
the government’s reliance
on oil taxes to fund its
expenditure. Despite the
impressive net income,
Financial Times reported
a profit of $26/barrel for
Aramco (after deducting
new sites to tout it as the
world’s most profitable
company.
The proceeds from
the bond issuance will
fund Aramco’s recent
purchase of a majority
stake in Sabic, a local
petrochemicals company
from the Saudi Arabian
Public Investment Fund
(PIF). The transaction
represents a 70% majority
stake that is worth $69bn.
As Aramco has a refining
and petrochemical
product line, this aligns
the strategies and interest
s of 2 major players in the
sector. The fresh injection
of capital into the PIF
forms part of Crown
Prince Mohammed bin
Salman’s Vision 2030
plan to diversify the
kingdoms economy away
from oil via the strategic
diversion of oil income
into non-oil assets through
the sovereign wealth fund.
While many are
familiar with bonds as
debt instruments, where
entities in need of capital
promise a percentage
return on a given loan,
this deal has less to do
with funding than might
be thought. The bond
prospectus revealed
Aramco’s strong balance
sheet and healthy cash
flows, with operating

Fitch commented on
the ability of the state to
interfere in key decision
concerning production,
dividend policies and
taxation as barriers to
obtaining a higher credit
rating.
