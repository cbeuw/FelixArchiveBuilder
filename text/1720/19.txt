A
badly scheduled
athletics calen-
dar meant the
second meet in
the London Universities
and Colleges Athletics
(LUCA) Outdoors League
fell on 20th April - Easter
Saturday.
Expectations of a
severely depleted squad
failed to materialise,
however, with 9 stoic
athletes still keen to
compete at the Lee Valley
Athletics Centre.
The day began on
the field with hammer
throw and long jump
taking centre stage. Super
milti-eventer Maryna Vo-
loshyna took on hammer
throw in her first event of
six and achieved a mighty
second place.
In the long jump,
scholarship athlete Idan
Gal-Shohet took a com-
fortable victory with a
giant leap of 6.5m in an
outdoors season’s best.
Over on the track, after
victories in both the 800m
and 1500m at the first
fixture at Parliament Hill,
James Millett took victory
once more in the 800m,
beating the time he set at
Parliament Hill by half a
second to run 1:59.05.
In the women’s 100
metres, long-jump spe-
cialist Sarah Abrams ran
a speedy 12.55 to place
second.
The match was also
host to the annual LUCA
“multi-event challenge”,
in which athletes get
a taste for multi-event
sport by competiting in a
selection of decathlon and
heptathlon events for men
and women respectively;
a sprint race, a middle
distance race, a jump and
a throw.
Imperial were repre-
sented in this competition
by Athletics Captain Jack
Mitchell and club favour-
ite Maryna Voloshyna.
In the men’s competi-
tion Mitchell competed
in the shot, high jump,
100m, and 1500m, even-
tually scoring 1630 points
to finish a respectable 4th
place.
In the women’s,
Maryna took on the shot,
high jump, 200m and
800m - as well as the
hammer throw and 2km
steeplechase - finishing
with 1304 and securing
the bronze medal!
In the final individual
event of the day - the
1500m - Imperial had 3
contenders in the men’s
race. Fresh off his 800m
victory James Millett was
eyeing his fourth win of
the series but after leading
in the early stages could
not hold on to beat Euan
Campbell from St Mary’s,
finishing under 2 seconds
behind the leader in 4:06.9
to place second.
Daniel Garcia made up
the top three with a 3rd
place finish in a personal
best time of 4:24.0,
and multi-eventer Jack
Mitchell finishing in 6th
to complete his four-event
effort.
With one fixture
remaining in the series -
Battersea Park on the 25th
May - Imperial sit 5th in
the overall standings with
a comfortable lead over
6th-placed LSE. The club
is hoping for a big at-
tendance to give the team
a chance of overtaking
the reigning champtions
King’s who go into the
match with a slim 19 point
lead over Imperial’s 116.
In the individual MVP
rankings, middle distance
specialist James Millett
lies in joint-5th following
his 3 wins out of 4 in the
800m and 1500m.
The final match
promises to be hotly
contested with medals
decided in almost all the
individual events and very
few points seperating the
field.
