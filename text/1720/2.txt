The season from hell
A
s I watched
Liverpool put
four goals
past Barcelo-
na at Anfield and Lucas
Moura grab a last gasp
hat-trick goal to send
Liverpool and Spurs,
respectively, through to
this year's Champions
League final, I couldn't
help but wonder... what
I could possibly have
done to deserve this.
I thought it was bad
enough that I've been
forced to become an
undercover Manchester
City fan over the last
few weeks of the title
run-in just because I
can't live in a world in
which Liverpool win the
league. The most painful
part about this season
from hell - the worst
season I've ever had to
endure in living mem-
ory - is that my team is
absolutely not involved.
We've been reduced to
mere spectators. Matters
of Europe and the top
four are really none of
my concern. I might as
well be a West Ham sup-
porter, there's nothing to
play for. These are tough
times to be a United fan.
I might resume my foot-
ball boycott. The NBA
playoffs are looking
particularly exciting.
I've always heard good
things about cricket.
Apparently golf is really
hotting up these days,
what's Tiger up to?
Anyway, on to more
serious matters. This
week's lead story is a very
interesting one, regarding
a member of the Senior
Management at College
and her concerningTwitter
2
activity surrounding the
transgender community.
Although I appreciate
College's response and the
matter seems to have been
resolved amicably, I can't
help but be left slightly
frustrated. I understand
that College must tow the
political line at all times,
but there are times when
I wish they would take a
firmer stance on matters
as pressing as these. A
more complete condem-
nation of transphobia
would only serve to
ensure that members of
the transgender commu-
nity feel better supported
by Imperial. This logic
can be extended to any
margianalised community
at Imperial, which finds
hateful rhetoric justified
under the guise of "free
speech" and "defending
debate". My problem with
this is that it gives both
sides of the discussion
equal weighting, despite
the fact that both sides
aren't equally affected by
the discussion at hand.
Having said this, I would
also say that progress has
been made and this is a
source of encouragement
for all concerned.
This week's Section of
the Week, goes to the Arts
section! Congratulations!
Fantastic work once
again; I feel a celebratory
Arts social is in order...

If you are interested in Grime
& Black British music, we want
to hear from you!

Mental Health Awareness Week
NEWS
Becky Neil
Deputy President (Welfare)
M
ental Health
Awareness
Week is
c o m i n g
next week from 13th
-
19th
May and the official
theme from the Mental
Health Foundation is
Body Image. Body
image is an insecurity
that can affect all of us
at any age and can really
impact how we feel
about ourselves. Feeling
uncomfortable with your
body can affect how you
eat, exercise and sleep,
which will impact your
daily life and ability to
study and research.
However, these are
not just feelings you may
have about your body.
You may experience
similar insecurities about
studying, socialising and
just living. You may feel
that you don’t belong
at Imperial, others are
more intelligent than
you, others are better at
research than you, people
don’t understand you and
that you are alone. All
these feelings are valid
but there is support out
there to help you.
The Advice Centre can
offer independent, con-
fidential and non-judge-
mental advice about aca-
demic and non-academic
issues. This may include
mitigating circumstances,
academic appeals and
also wellbeing advice.
With exams and hand-ins
coming up, it’s important
to think about whether you
need to submit mitigating
circumstances. If you feel
something has affected
your performance, get
in touch with the Advice
Centre (advice@imperial.
ac.uk) and they’ll be able
to explain and guide you
through the process. They
are also offering wellbe-
ing advice so if you just
want someone to talk to,
you can always make an
appointment. The team
will be out and about
round campus, so drop by
one of their stalls to see
them or follow their social
media campaign.
Other sources of
support that may be useful
include: Disabilities
Advisory Service, who
can give advice about
concentration, studying
and revising; Chaplaincy,
who offer a quite space
for meditation, mindful-
ness or religious prac-
tices; Ethos offers sports
facilities and classes
and the Student Hub can
help if you’re concerned
about accommodation or
finances.
The Counselling and
Mental Health Advice
Service can run sessions
on personal issues for
you to talk through and
support you if you are ex-
periencing mental health
difficulties. Alternatively,
you can reach out to a
GP at Imperial College
Health Centre if you are
experiencing difficulties.
Your department is a
great source of support
especially for information
about exams, course
content and research
support. You can reach
out to your personal tutor,
course leader, senior tutor
or supervisor as they
can speak with you or
signpost you to a service
or someone you can speak
to. Speak to your peers as
well, they may have some
tips, may be feeling the
same, or you may be able
to work together and take
breaks together.
The Graduate School
is running loads of events
during the week so head
along and get involved
in their activities. You
can find all their activ-
ities here: https://www.
imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/
graduate-school/events/
mental-health-awareness-
week/
Everyone has mental
health and your mental
wellbeing can fluctuate.
Having good mental
wellbeing can give you
greater self-confidence,
healthier behaviours and
an improved quality of
life. During this busy
period try to notice your
mental wellbeing and see
when it is slipping so you
can take action. Some
things you may want to be
aware of are sleep, eating,
exercising, your environ-
ment, the people around
you and doing something
you enjoy. It’s important
to find a balance with
everything you are doing
but that balance will look
different for everyone.
You can’t compare what
you are doing with others
as everyone does it their
own way. Finally, it’s okay
to ask for help, whether
that’s speaking to a friend,
someone at the university
or the Union or searching
online. Asking for help is
a sign of strength and you
should use it.
