Avengers: Endgame
An imperfect, yet wholly satisfying, conclusion to 11 years of films.
O
nce again
directed by Joe
& Anthony
Russo, starring
Robert Downey Jr., Chris
Evans, Chris Hemsworth,
Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett
Johansson and Jeremy
Renner as the original
Avengers, Paul Rudd as
Ant-Man and Josh Brolin
as Thanos, mega-block-
busterAvengers:Endgame
is the direct sequel of
Avengers: Infinity War.
Besides having to wrap up
a story as monumental and
gargantuan in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe
(MCU) as Infinity War,
Endgame has a second
and much more serious
burden – to wrap up the
stories of many characters
that have graced the screen
throughout the decade.
The story picks up
where Infinity War left
it, i.e. after Thanos suc-
cessfully removed half
of all life in the universe.
The original six Avengers
were left intact and, in
Endgame, they must find
a way to fix everything,
whatever it takes. The
previous MCU entries
have always felt slightly
inconsequential, because
we can always expect
an Avenger or two to
pop up again in a future
instalment. However,
Endgame, for the first
time in the history of the
MCU, has to convey a
sense of finality. It has to
provide a conclusion to
the sprawling storylines
and characters the MCU
introduced, especially
for the first batch of
Avengers, who we have
grown to love and cherish;
and I find Endgame’s
conclusion very satisfying
and well executed, with
multiple character arcs
tying up organically and
elegantly.

“After finishing
Endgame,
there are still
no words that
can adequately
encapsulate
the shock and
beauty”
apparently a film made by
fans for fans. However,
the entirety of the second
act feels too much like a
piece of fan-fiction. It is
definitely fun to watch,
but it is executed rather
too carelessly.
The last act, however,
made all the wait worth
it, and dwarfs all the
shortcomings of the film.
Hours after finishing
Endgame, there are still no
words that can adequately
encapsulate the shock
and beauty of the third
act. It completely demol-
ishes and obliterates the
meaning of “awesome”.
It was beyond anyone’s
expectation. No one
asked for it, yet the Russo
Brothers delivered none-
theless. Word of advice:
go and watch Endgame
on the biggest screen you
can find (if you haven’t
already), it will be worth
it.
the absolute standouts
must be Chris Evans as
Steve Rogers, and Robert
Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.
After reprising their roles
nearly ten times each,
these two actors effort-
lessly and confidently
carry the film with wit,
strength and heart. Infinity
War might be better paced
and structured than its
sequel, but Endgame
finds our heroes at their
most human and most
vulnerable, and proves to
be the most emotionally
powerful MCU film to
date.
Despite infrequent
flaws, Avengers: Endgame
is a thrilling, epic and very
emotional conclusion to
an 11-year journey, and a
bountiful reward for fans
who have stayed with
these characters every
step of the way. With the
latest entry, the MCU
shall stand in history as
one of the most ambitious
and successful cinematic
experiments ever con-
ducted. The many pas-
sionate people that spent
countless hours crafting
this film must be recog-
nised with gratitude and
respect for providing us
a truly once-in-a-lifetime
cinematic experience.

AVENGERS: ENDGAME
This is not to say
that the film is perfect.
Without mentioning any
specifics, Endgame can
be very easily dissected
into three acts – a sombre
and slower first act where
the effect of Thanos’
massacre is explored,
a relatively upbeat and
comical second act, and
an indescribably epic
third act.
The first act presents
the most human side of
our heroes, and felt more
like an episode of The
Leftovers than a superhero
blockbuster. The second
act has a much faster
pace, but is also slightly
disappointing (a lot of
people are not going to
share my view). It is
very enjoyable, and often
hilarious, yet it runs a bit
too long and relies a bit
too heavily on fan service.
I have nothing against fan
service, Endgame is very
The performances are
stellar across the entire
cast, from the irreverent
but hilarious portrayal of
ThorbyChrisHemsworth,
to Jeremy Renner’s Ronin
hellbent on rediscovering
his purpose in a post-
Snap world. Josh Brolin’s
Thanos is slightly more
unhinged, and even
more dangerous this
time around. However,
