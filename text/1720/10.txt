Okay Google. What’s a replacement to consoles?

C
onsole genera-
tions have been
marked with
gamers dropping
over £300-£400 on a new
console, £50 on new titles,
and more recently £60 a
year to play their games
online. But what if the
future of the next genera-
tion required no consoles,
no fancy rigs nor any
need to pay to access the
boradband your already
paying for?
The entertainment
industryhasmostlymoved
away from physical media
and has embraced digital
downloads and with the
advent of platforms such
as Spotify and Netflix.
Consumers no longer need
to “own” media in order to
enjoy music and movies.
An unlimited selection
of titles is now what the
average person expects.
But can gaming become
the next industry to be
embraced by streaming?
Short answer: Yes. Long
answer: It’s complicated.
Cloud Gaming
Now subscrip-
tion-based models for
access to a large library
of video game titles
is nothing new for the
industry. The idea of a
cloud gaming service is
already a decade old. It
has been trialled, tested,
released, a bit of success
before ultimately failing.
This gaming achievement
was unlocked by OnLive.
distribution. It worked for
Spotify and it worked for
Netflix. The service, to
the surprise of video game
sceptics, worked!
So where is OnLive
now? A myriad of
business issues behind the
scenes ultimately led to
OnLive becoming defunct
in April 2015 with Sony
acquiring its patents. It
was a service which was
ahead of its time.
PlayStation Now
Sony, then also
equipped with Gaikai,
(a rival of OnLive in the
early 2010s), had been
making great advances
in cloud based gaming
with the PSP and PS Vita
allowing Remote Play
(a method of streaming)
with the PS3 and PS4.
Sony had introduced
its digital video game
subscription service with
PlayStation Now in 2015
on PlayStation 4 and PC.
This has given gamers
access to over 500 Play-
station titles for £12.99
per month. This service in
some aspects represents
the “Netflix of gaming”
narrative. But it’s require-
ments of downloads now
combined with it being
targeted at a pre-existing
market of gamers does not
embrace what OnLive set
out to do.
Google Stadia
Initially conceptualised
as Project Stream, the
Stadia was unveiled at
Game Developers Con-
ference (GDC) in March
2019. The Stadia aims
to embrace the Netflix
arhcitecture for media as
OnLive did during its era.
This is Google’s first step
into the games industry,
and it is definitely a bold
move.
The heavy processing
that was previously tied to
expensive gaming rigs and
consoles using Google’s
infrastructure. Claims of
10.7 teraflops of power
have cited for cloud com-
puters which make light
work of the Xbox One X’s
6.0 teraflops.
Stadia is designed to
run simply through the
Google Chrome browser.
Nothing else is needed
besides a controller.
Alphabet also owns
YouTube, so it should
be no surprise that the
massive video sharing
platform will be used
to enhance the Stadia
experience. You could be
watching a trailer for a
game which is currently
out, and if it’s available on
the Stadia, then you could
be playing it instantly.
Project xCloud, Apple
Arcade and Tencent Start.
The future of cloud based
gaming is certainly up in
the air. The Stadia is a
cool concept, but Google
is certainly not an origina-
tor in this field.
Verdict?
The chief marketing
officer of Xbox, Mike
Nichols, has claimed that
Google might struggle to
compete as they “don’t
have the content”. which
is a valid claim. We still
have much to learn about
the Stadia including its
unknown game library,
unknown price, and the
dependence on your
internet connection.
Though with improving
broadband speeds as well
as the 5G rollout, this
issue going into 2020
could be prevented from
being the Achille’s Heel
of Google Stadia.
The Google Stadia will
release towards the end
of 2019. Who knows,
we might have Google
appearing at E3 this year.

“Subscriptions

The First Attempt
What exactly was
OnLive? It was a cloud
gaming service which
enabled its subscribers to
rent video games without
having to install games
on their device. All the
rendering for the games
happened on remote
servers and the fully
rendered game would be
sent to your device. No
longer would you need to
dedicate your 1TB hard
drive to 500GB of video
games and DLC. Gamers
could rejoice at this rev-
olutionary concept. There
would have been no need
to build expensive PC rigs
and the appeal of an easier
distribution platform
would have surely pulled
developers and publishers
to this new method of
“Stadia is a
cool concept,
but Google is
certainly not
an originator
in this field”
With a large community
of streamers on YouTube,
Google can easily incor-
porate the average watcher
into a gamer with Stadia’s
“Crowd Play” feature
which will allow players
to jump into the same
game as their favourite
streamer and even join
their multiplayer session.
Google’s not the only
tech giant entering the
game industry. Rival
technology companies
Microsoft, Apple and
Tencent all have their own
projects in the works with
The next generation of gaming might not be defined by consoles, but by a “Netflix” approach to your gaming
library.
