Air pollution in London: where are we now?

t is not an exag-
geration to say that
pollution is one of
London’s biggest
challenges for the fore-
seeable future. While it
is true that the situation
is not as concerning as
70 years ago, when the
pea soup-like Great Smog
killed 4000 people in less
than a week, the current
pollution cloud that floats
over the capital is still a
major health hazard for
all Londoners, especially
the youngest and oldest
citizens. In anticipation
of the 20th
May speaking
event on the matter, or-
ganised by the Times and
Imperial College London,
I will present to the Felix
readers an objective ac-
count of the present state
of the problem.
When the media talks
about air pollution, a
majority of us imagine a
bleak landscape of black
fumes coming from a
multitude of factories.
Indeed, pollution is
caused by the emission of
toxic substances resulting
from human activity. But
what are those substances
exactly, and why are they
harmful for us and the
environment?
The causes of the and Strand recording
the highest amounts. In
2013, it was estimated
that vehicle engines were
responsible for half of
all emissions of NO2
into
London, much more than
aviation and industry,
which accounted for 7%
each.Thus, it is imperative
to tackle the problem of
vehicle emissions in order
to solve this public health
crisis. This is the point
where we meet a term that
has become quite familiar
in the last month: ULEZ.
The measures taken
Central London Conges-
tion Charge of £11.50 is
applied on top of that.
While it may sound harsh,
and indeed there has been
some protesting over the
matter, 70% of London-
ers approve the current
measures, and a similar
amount would like further
restrictions.
A glimpse of hope
It is extremely early to
evaluate the effect that
the ULEZ has had on the
overall pollution levels
of London, but there is
encouraging research that
shows the less extensive
regulations implemented
since 2010 have been
somewhat successful in
improving the quality of
air. Total NO2
emissions
have fallen by 9% since
2013 and no breaches of
the annual pollution levels
allowed by European
directives have occurred
in 2019 so far.

problem
The three big bad boys
most responsible for the
current sad state of the
air quality in our city are
nitrogen dioxide (NO2
),
sulphur dioxide (SO2
)
and carbon monoxide
(CO). NO2
comes from
the combination of the
nitric oxide (NO) emitted
by heating and engines in
vehicles with the oxygen
present in the air; SO2
is
a by-product of the com-
bustion of coal, oil and
gas, which contain small
amounts of sulphur, and
CO is the main product of
said combustion when it
is done under conditions
where the concentration of
oxygen is low. The health
effects resulting from pro-
longed exposition to them
include higher chances
of developing chronic
respiratory diseases,
several types of cancer
and overall reduced life
expectancy. It is estimated
that 4000 Londoners had
to be hospitalised due to
the ill effects of pollution
on their health between
the years 2014 and 2016,
a quarter of them being
children under the age of
14. 600,000 Londoners
suffer from asthma, a con-
dition that is worsened by
high levels of air pollution
In 2016, the annual
mean levels of NO2
concentrations in 59 of
97 air monitoring sites in
London were over the UK
legal limit, with Brixton
Road, Oxford Street
to tackle it
While several initia-
tives have been imple-
mented for the last couple
of decades by both the
Mayor and the London
boroughs in the hopes of
improving the air quality
of the city (e.g. promotion
of the bike as a mean of
transportation, Conges-
tion Charge for vehicles
in Central London
between 7am and 6pm on
weekdays), the recently
implemented Ultra Low
Emission Zone (ULEZ) is
by far the most ambitious
policy adopted by the
local administration to
date. Currently covering
the West End, Bankside,
the City and parts of the
East End, the ULEZ will
be extended to the North
and South Circular Roads
in 2023, thus including
more than 3.8 million
people under its reach.
The scheme is very
similar to the Central
London Congestion
Charge started in 2003,
but it now operates 24
hours a day, seven days
a week. Drivers of pol-
luting vehicles (i.e. those
that do not comply with
the European emission
standards in their respec-
tive categories) need to
pay £12.50 per day for
driving within the zone,
or £100 if they are driving
heavier vehicles like
lorries or coaches. The
Forget Brexit: What is being
ignored?
At the next event, The Times will launch a com-
petition to give one Imperial student the chance
to write for Red Box, The Times’award-winning
political newsletter, once a month for a three
month period. The winner will also meet Matt
Chorley, the editor of Red Box, to find out what
it’s like working in Westminster.
Full details of how to enter will be announced
May 20th
but, if you’re interested, start thinking
about what are the issues which are important
to you that are being overlooked while politi-
cians are distracted by Brexit? What is the one
law you would pass if you were prime minister
for the day? What is happening in health, educa-
tion, housing, employment, welfare, the envi-
ronment, transport, the arts, sport and family
life? And what will be the long-term impact on
Britain if the problems are not tackled soon?
ask questions to some of
the biggest experts in the
area.
