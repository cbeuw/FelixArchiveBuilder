Joining ESN this year has far exceeded any expec-
tations. It has been so rewarding to be involved with
hosting events and supporting our members, as well
as being involved in national and international events
with other committees from around Europe. This Easter
I went to Thessaloniki, Greece, for the international
AGM, and returned even more motivated to continue
to be a part of ESN.
Two years ago, I finished what must have been the
craziest and most fun years of my life. In one short year,
I discovered new places, new beers and made some
amazing friends.
Since returning to Imperial, I joined as the ESN
Imperial Vice-President and have had the pleasure of
organising events alongside some of the most driven

Belly Dancing Summer
Workshop: Dancing with
a sword
A
s featured in
last week’s
Felix, during
the summer
term ICU Belly Dancing
hosts a summer work-
shop series instead of
regular classes, due to
the disruption that arises
from exams happening at
different points in term
across departments. All of
our workshops are suita-
ble for beginners, so even
if you’ve never danced
before, you’re more than
welcome to join us! The
series is starting tonight
(10th
May) 6-8pm with
Polynesian Fusion in
Meeting Rooms 1&2 in
the Union Building (£15
otd for non-members). If
that’s too short notice (or
if you’ve only just picked
up a copy of Felix and it’s
now Tuesday), then here’s
what to expect next.
In less than two weeks
we are hosting our
second workshop of term:
Swords. We’ve invited
our Advanced Plus class
teacher Sureya to give
this workshop, after she
gave an awesome double
swords solo at our annual
showcase back in March.
Sureya is a professional
belly dance performer,
instructor and choreogra-
pher based in London, her
passion for belly dance
coming from her Turkish
background. Sureya has
been described as an ener-
getic, vibrant and versatile
performer who is keen to

Officer
When: 18:00-20:00, Tuesday 21st
May
Where: Activity Space 1, Floor 1, Union Building
Tickets: £10 for members, £12 for non-members – on the door or on the
Union website
share her love of dance
through teaching around
the UK. For more infor-
mation, please visit www.

Whether you are new
to dancing with sword
or want to sharpen your
sword skills further,
this workshop is a great
challenge to extend your
dance repertoire. Sureya
will demonstrate and
break down the important
techniques for sword
dancing including holding
and balancing it, using a
sword to improve your
isolations and travelling
steps.
We unfortunately
cannot provide swords for
everyone during the class
(Sureya will have a few to
pass round), but we will
be providing canes to use
in their place, in order for
you to practice the tech-
niques (it is quite common
to start with canes when
learning the sword, as
they are much lighter).
We have a limited number
of canes so it is advised to
book online in advance to
avoid disappointment on
the day!
We hope you’ll join us
for this workshop – if you
can’t make it but are still
interested in learning to
belly dance with us, we
have a belly-hoop class
on 4th
June and a “vintage
combos” tribal fusion
workshop on 18th
June.
Our regular classes will
start up again in October,
when we will run a weekly
beginners’ class for new-
comers to the style! You
can email bellydancing@
imperial.ac.uk if you
would like details on any
of our activities..
You can follow us on
social media to keep up
with our classes and per-
formances. We have Ins-
tagram: icu_belly_dance,
Twitter: @ICUBelly, a
Facebook page: ICbel-
lydance and a YouTube
channel: ICBellydance.
We also have a lot of info
on our website: www.

and energetic people. As a team of ex-Erasmus students, we have always aimed to
enrich our incoming exchange student’s experience of both Imperial and London.
Furthermore, through ESN, I have had the opportunity to create international partner-
ships, participate in national platforms, attend an international AGM (>1000 student
volunteers) and solidify Imperial’s position in something much greater.
*You will have the chance to develop your role as well as help other committee
members with theirs - we know exams and coursework are a priority!
