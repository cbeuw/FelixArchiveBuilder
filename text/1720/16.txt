As the weather
warms up,
reports are
coming in
about this year’s first
knee sightings. Yes, you
heard me right! Hem-
lines are migrating north
from their southern
winter nests and with
them are coming floaty
dresses, shorts and bare
knees.
However, all is not
well in paradise. There
have been unprecedented
reports of horrific bare
knee related incidents.
The male gaze factor
(MGF) allegedly is so
strong around this time of
year that the few pairs of
knees that dared to emerge
have been swiftly driven
back into hiding. We
have reports of the male
gaze causing burning,
blistering, chapping and
becoming so aware of
being viewed as an object
that you spontaneously
disappear. A horrific
outcome for those brave
early knees!
You proud knee owners
need worry no more
though! We listened to
our readers’ concerns
right back to their source,
dazzling, blinding and
wowing. There is even
a little bit of camomile
in there just to perk you
up when you are feeling
oppressed by the particu-
larly high MGF present in
Metric.
One grateful customer
told us that they now
put some on each day:
“My co-workers have all
started wearing sunglass-
es”.
The serum is now also
usable by women and
actual male gays!
We’re woke now!!
