Stanley Kubrick: The Exhibition
W
hat an
opening. As
the dramatic
music of
Also Sprach Zarathustra
thunders in the back-
ground, the psychedelic
hexagonal carpet from The
Shining rolls underfoot.
We enter a bright corri-
dor of screens, Stanley
Kubrick’s most iconic
scenes flashing by as we
get closer and closer to the
main screen itself. It’s a
homage to the beautifully
symmetrical one-point
perspective used in his
cinematic shots, but also
gives the strong sense
of being, quite literally,
sucked into Kubrick’s
world of film-making.
A fitting start to this
new exhibition marking
the 20th anniversary of
the filmmaker’s death.
Prepare to be wholly
immersed in what went on
in that brilliant mind - the
mind that gave us some
of the most unforgettable,
genre-defining films of
our time.
A single wood-panelled
room awaits us. Loosely
organised, it’s a bit like a
cabinet of curiosities with
Kubrick paraphernalia
everywhere. The direc-
tor’s chair sits proudly in
a corner; one of his many
Academy Awards is dis-
played nearby, alongside
Sasco cards annotated
by Kubrick himself and
a letter from Audrey
Hepburn. Original screen-
plays and scripts are ex-
hibited in the centre of the
room, each rumpled with
use and scribbled over
with handwritten notes
in Kubrick’s own hand.
It’s exciting to see his
marks all over the source
material: some dialogue
lines resolutely crossed
out, others underlined and
emphasised with an excla-
mation mark or two, and
little storyboard sketches
in the blank spaces.
Original costume and
set design sketches litter
the walls, alongside
scouting photographs
taken in search of the ideal
shooting locations. It’s
like a behind-the-scenes
tour of the director’s
mind. It’s easy to see his
famed perfectionism,
attention to detail and the
sheer amount of prepara-
tion that went into each of
his films. For Napoleon, a
film on the French general
Kubrick planned but never
completed, rows of histor-
ical books on Napoleon
which fill a shelf on one
side of the room - and that
was just the pre-reading.
Kubrick was well-
by Kubrick to shoot low-
light candlelit scenes in
his period drama Barry
Lyndon. And, of course,
the famous centrifuge set
used to model the space-
ship Discovery in 2001:
A Space Odyssey; taking
6 months and £580,000
to build, it enabled the
creation of the futuristi-
cally continuous space-
ship interior, one living
space merging seamlessly
with the next in a gigantic
treadmill. Never one to
be satisfied with current
technology, Kubrick was
always looking to use
new techniques and new
technology to achieve the
effects he wanted. Also on
display is the novel slit-
scan photography used by
Doug Trumbull to achieve
the psychedelic light
effects of the final ‘Star
Gate’ sequence, repre-
senting a journey through
space and time. While
something we might take
for granted now with
the advent of CGI, this
mind-bending light show
was made entirely without
computer effects and
offered audiences some-
thing that had never been
seen before in film.
The second, meatier
part of the exhibition goes
into the making of each
of his films in glorious
detail. The most famous
scenes from each film are
projected on large screens
for viewers to get a taste
of the finished product.
Each section is rich with
production photographs,
original storyboard
sketches and concept art,
with iconic set pieces
and costumes from each
film on full display. There
are some real gems here.
Among these are Private
Joker’s helmet from Full
Metal Jacket, the slogan
“Born To Kill” scrawled
across it right next to a
peace sign pin; the pho-
toshoot of 14-year-old
Sue Lyon, star of Lolita,
staring provocatively
over her heart-shaped
sunglasses; Sir Kenneth
Adam’s concept sketches
for the War Room in Dr
Strangelove, described by
Spielberg as the ‘finest set
ever designed’. Important
work from other contribu-
tors to Kubrick’s films is
well-acknowledged, from
the graphic design of Saul
Bass or Philip Castle to
Milena Canonero’s beau-
tiful costumes designed
for Barry Lyndon.
The curators have also
gone to the trouble to
showcase both the things
that might have influ-
enced Kubrick and also
the impact his films had
on society. Don McCull-
in’s haunting photographs
of the Vietnam War are
prominently displayed
in the section devoted to
Full Metal Jacket, a film
about the brutal impact of
the Vietnam War on both
soldiers and civilians.
Meanwhile, a series of
irate letters from the
public capture the con-
troversy stirred up by the
violence of A Clockwork
Orange and the sexual-
isation of a teenage girl
described in Lolita. There
are also fascinating tidbits
about the creative process
behind each film. For
Eyes Wide Open, Kubrick
had to shoot a story based
in NYC on the streets of
London - his meticulous
insistence on authentic-
ity led him to have his
assistant painstakingly
photograph the whole
of Commercial Street,
one photo at a time, on a
12-foot ladder.
The exhibition ends,
fittingly, with his most
famous and technically
challenging work, 2001:
A Space Odyssey. It was
the genre-defining film
that would shape the
way we thought about
futurism and science
fiction forever. Capturing
the sense of space explo-
ration and futurism of the
time, Kubrick’s 2001:
A Space Odyssey was a
realistic view of a plau-
sible future, predicting
iPads and current worries
about sentient artificial
intelligence. Kubrick and
his team imagined this
possible future in stunning
detail, ranging from
technical consultations
with IBM for the design
of intelligent computer
HAL-9000, right down
to the furniture, watches,
clothing and even cutlery
used in his vision of 2001.
On display here, though
not included in the film, is
even an intriguing range
of ‘futuristic makeup
products’ envisioned by
cosmetics giant Coty for
use by the ladies of 2001.
It was characteristic
of Kubrick, perhaps, to
craft whole new worlds
for each of his films,
although only part of
them would ever be seen
by audiences. While this
made him set punishingly
high standards for his
staff and chosen actors
- there’s a bit in the exhi-
bition about how he made
Tom Cruise walk through
a door 90 times for Eyes
Wide Shut - it also gave
him the ‘magic’he looked
for in front of his camera,
and which filtered down
to us as audiences. There
certainly is something
magical about watching
a Kubrick film. Whether
horror, science fiction,
war film or even historical
drama, he elevated every
genre he ever turned his
hand to, without losing
his distinctive style.
The thing about magic
is that it can’t be ex-
plained. But the Design
Museum’s breathtaking
retrospective gives a
glimpse of what went on
inside the head of this
eccentric, influential and
groundbreaking director.
An exhibition that will
satisfy even the most
hardcore Kubrick fan, and
leave you with a strange
desire to watch all his
films in one sitting.
Delve into the brilliant mind of one of the world’s most revolutionary filmmakers.

OVO whisks
us through this
o u t r a g e o u s l y
funny play in just over
90 minutes, complete
with a live jazz band and
pop tunes by the likes
of Rihanna, Radiohead,
Britney Spears, and more.
It might have seemed a
little fast for Shakespeare,
but I personally loved the
pace, and they kept a lot
of the original text with
adjustments only made to
fit the length. The songs
created great breaks in
the action, and whilst this
may not have been the
right play for diehard fans
of the Bard, it was perfect
for anyone who wants
to ease themselves into
Shakespeare, or doesn’t
usually enjoy it so much.
Set on a cruise liner in
the 20s, the stage design
was simple yet fabulous.
The small upper section of
the Rose Playhouse was
used for the entire play,
with the audience seated
amongst all the action. It
aptly mimicked the deck
of the SS Illyria, so I
applaud Simon Nicholas
for an incredibly clever
use of the space. The
jazz band performed in
amongst us, sometimes at
the back and sometimes in
the middle on the stage,
making the feel like a
really immersive experi-
ence.
I have never seen such
an imaginative interpreta-
tion of a play, and I never
would have guessed it
would work.The cast were
excellent, many of them
also playing instruments.
Feste, played by Hannah
Francis-Baker definitely
stood out to me, aside
from acting and playing
the trumpet, her stage
presence and liveliness
whilst singing (probably
the best voice out of the
cast) really pushed the
show forward. Viola,
played by Lucy Crick,
was also wonderful in her
role, though I must admit
I was less taken with her
singing; perhaps it was
because her voice wasn’t
as suited to the style of
music. The rest of the
cast were also hilarious,
in particular Sir Andrew,
played by James Douglas.
Faith Turner as a female
version of Malvolio, here
dubbed Malvolia, was also
a stand out performance
as the snooty, disapprov-
ing right-hand woman
to Olivia. She ends the
play singing a beautiful
song, giving the ending a
bit of a sad, unexpected
twist which I’d never seen
before.
One of my only qualms
would be that some
songs didn’t fit with the
storyline. Whilst it was
lovely to hear fun jazz
renditions of catchy songs
that we all knew the
words to, from classics
like Creep by Radiohead,
to chart hits from Jason
Derulo, a few of them just
didn’t feel like they made
sense in the context of the
play. On the other hand,
presumably not everyone
was paying as much un-
required attention to the
lyrics as I was, but rather
just enjoying the live
music!
This is definitely the
play to see if you’re
looking for a very inven-
tive and original version
of a classic play, be that
because you want to get
into Shakespeare but
don’t know where to start,
or you just enjoy quirky
small productions by
groups of talented under-
rated people.
T
he Picture of
Dorian Gray
is one of
Oscar Wilde’s
best-known works,
and certainly the most
controversial. Published
in 1890, it immediately
attracted criticism for the
hedonism and immorality
promulgated in its pages,
with Wilde accused of
‘offending public morals’.
The story is of Dorian
Gray, a beautiful young
man who, influenced by
the rich and sybaritic Lord
Henry, comes to the pur-
suit of pleasure as the only
important things in life.
Rashly, he wishes that a
painting of him at the peak
of his youth would age,
with he himself staying
unchanged forever. His
wish is fulfilled; despite
his spiral into corruption,
he remains young and
beautiful, the portrait
alone becoming the
window onto his wicked
soul.
Tilted Wig Productions’
new adaptation, directed
by Séan Aydon, makes a
brave stab at capturing
the complexity of Dorian
Gray for the stage. While
certainly a solid produc-
tion, Aydon’s direction
comes across as a bit too
one-dimensional, missing
out on the emotional sub-
tleties and inner turmoil of
Wilde’s original Dorian.
Perhaps this is also in
part due to Gavin Fowler’s
portrayal. Fowler never
really seems to comforta-
bly inhabit the character of
Dorian. Excessively full
of naivete in the begin-
ning, he does a complete
360 into some sort of
machisimo-fuelled sexual
predator without so much
as an interval between.
With ‘good Dorian’ and
‘evil Dorian’played rather
like caricatures, there’s
little explanation for why
the ‘unspoilt young man’
suddenly turns into a
cold-hearted, degenerate
cad at what seems to be
Also worth noting is
Phoebe Pryce for her
imperious, cool-as-a-cu-
cumber portrayal of Lady
Victoria Wotton, though
her stage time was sadly
limited.
All 19 scenes take place
in Sarah Beaton’s delight-
fully eerie set – the high,
cracked, paint-peeling
walls of an artist’s studio
appropriately capturing
the themes of rot and
decay. With no real set
changes for any of the
scenes, it gets a little static,
but changes in lighting
work well to convey the
right atmosphere.
The production does
suffer a little from a taste
for melodrama, which
rather detracts from the
plot. Midway through,
just to hammer home
the point about Dorian’s
descent into depravity,
Lord Henry and Dorian go
off to a Killing Kittens-es-
que sex orgy. The lights
start flashing red, various
masked, leather-clad
people gyrate to thumping
music and to top it all off,
Lord Henry starts inject-
ing heroin in the corner. I
couldn’t help but giggle.
The titular picture is
represented by a clear
pane of plastic, which
reappears as slightly
cracked and opaque after
Dorian’s misdeeds. I
found this visually under-
whelming – nowhere near
vile and horrible enough
to represent Dorian’s
corrupt soul or to justify
his horrified reaction
at the end of the play.
Dorian’s death, despite
the flashing backlights
and his melodramatically
collapsing silhouette, ulti-
mately falls short in actual
dramatic impact.
Avisually pleasing pro-
duction that doesn’t quite
give us the wittiness and
nuance of Wilde’s novel.
Dare I say, the book is
better than the play?

Jonathan Wrather, on
the other hand, makes for
an excellent Lord Henry
Wotton. Powerful and
razor-sharp, he radiates
the aura of one who is
used to having his every
desire fulfilled and with
no compunctions about
crushing others in the
process. The seductive
power of Wrather’s Lord
Henry would corrupt
anyone. It makes it all
the more moving when
he reappears in the last
scenes as a broken man,
who, for all his hedonistic
convictions, has not found
what he wanted in life.
Daniel Goode makes
a good effort at playing
Basil Hallward, the artist
who is in love with Dorian
and tries to save him from
his downfall. It’s a very
restrained and yearning
depiction, with Hallward
left dismayed and power-
less as Dorian slips further
into degeneracy. The only
thing is that the relation-
ship between the two
seems entirely one-sided.
You don’t really get the
sense that Dorian is at all
moved by Basil or that
Basil ‘could have saved
Dorian’ with his love – he
just seems a bit of a side
character who Dorian
tires of once Lord Henry
comes into the picture.
