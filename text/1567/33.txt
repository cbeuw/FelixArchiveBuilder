QuizUp: Upping the game
Medic Training Simulator
There are a ton of simulator games
out there. For people who want to try
their hand at Farming, driving a bus,
or mining a stone quarry there are
simulator games out there for you!
These games portray all the elements
you need to master to be successful in
these games, often sacrificing fun in
their quest to be 100% accurate. This
week, Felix games tried out a simulator
game that defies the convention
and does the exact opposite of this.
Surgeon simulator definitely includes
more fun than accuracy and is one
of the most hilarious games I’ve ever
played.
Surgeon simulator, unlike every
other simulator game, has very simple
controls. You can orient and move
one hand in space with the mouse
and move each finger in and out with
a different button. The first challenge
of the game is to select a mission. You
start off in a surgery office and must
immediately move your hand around
to select a surgery from the clip pad.
Everything in the game is interactive
and this provides added fun through
the often funnily named achievements
that pop up. For example you get an
achievement for making the rock
horns with your hands, or creating a
time lord by inserting two hearts into
your patient.
The surgeries (transplants) normally
take the same steps to complete. First
you must remove as much as you
possibly can, including the required
organ that you are transplanting.
Sometimes this is easy; remove the
ribs with a hammer, the intestines
a hacksaw, etc. Often times it is not
as easy as it sounds as you have to
carefully cut certain connecting
arteries before you are able to rip
out the organs and this coupled with
the awkward controls makes the
game hard. This is where the humour
saves the game. Sometimes you are
frustrated after “accidently” killing the
patient but you are laughing too much
to care. The game teaches you that
so much can go wrong with surgery,
you can drug yourself, electrocute
yourself, have a precision cutting laser
fly around the room as you forget to
put it back in its container but the
satisfaction of removing parts of a
patient and successfully performing a
transplant makes up for this.
Surgeon simulator gives you a rating
at the end of each mission which
provides replay value and has different
modes of surgery. Once you’ve
completed the 3 basic surgeries (heart,
kidney and brain transplants) you can
repeat them again from the back of an
ambulance. Ambulance mode is much
harder as the driver seems to go very
fast over every speed bump they can
find sending tools and parts of the
patient flying (to be fair this is how I
would drive in an ambulance driver
simulator game). You can even loose
parts out the back of the ambulance
which makes you creative as you try
to perform the surgery having lost
the “correct” tools. Another special
mode worth mentioning is the uber
heart transplant surgery which sees
you as a medic from Team Fortress 2
performing a heart transplant on one
of your fallen team mates. This mode
however gives you team fortress 2
items such as the engineers wrench to
perform the surgery which makes for
a very messy time. My patient died in
this mode because they were slowly
bleeding out after I’d removed the
heart and I failed to find the new one.
Overall Surgeon Simulator is an
entertaining game that does not take
itself too seriously. It looks good
visually, provides a unique game
experience and offers much for its
price of £6.99. It’s a game that can be
enjoyed by all. Completionists can
look forward to finding all the games
secrets and unlocking the games
achievements, the hardcore among
you can speed run the game or you
can just enjoy doing the occasional
surgery now and then. Personally I
like to play this game with a cup of tea
while in my pyjamas which is maybe
why I’m not very good at it. This
game won’t teach you to be a surgeon
but it will provide you with hours of
entertainment and is definitely worth
picking up.
I woke up to find myself cold and
thirsty on beach in Chernarus. All
I had on me was the clothes I was
wearing and a flashlight. Time to
survive the Zombie apocalypse. I
had no clue at all where I was, all
I knew was that my stomach was
grumbling, my throat was parched
andwithoutanysortofnourishment
I would not survive till the next day.
I pushed myself up from the grass
I was sitting on, and gazed at my
surroundings. In the distance I saw
an industrial complex, and although
I had not much hope that I would
find anything of use there, I made
my way over there.
However as I approached, I saw an
axe-wielding man trying to kill an
empty handed guy facing off. Since
I was weak I decide to sit this one
out. This was a prudent choice, as
it seemed that the axe-wielder was
not very friendly and consequently
bashed the other guys face. As I
waited for axe-man to loot the
body and clear out, I hoped that
there would still be something for
me to find once the body had been
stripped clean. I waited about for
about 20 minutes, my stomach
occasionally growling. It felt like
the longest wait of my life Then
when I felt like it was safe time to
come out, I did. At this point I was
aware, that if I didn’t find anything
to eat or drink, I would die. I was
feeling weak, and falling in and out
of consciousness. I crawled towards
the body, praying for mercy. As I
opened up his backpack my eyes fell
upon the two most beautiful things
I had ever seen. A bag of rice and a
half-full water bottle nestled sweetly
inside. I ate half the bag, and drank
the entire bottle of water. The world
around me looked so much brighter.
Now I had a chance at surviving.
Time to go, I strapped the dead
man’s backpack on and strode in to
the sunset.
DayZ Stories
The DayZ standalone has been
released, and given the amazing
stories that occur in that game, I
decided to make a kind of series
out it! So here it goes:

Transplanting the fun back into simulator games

Games Editor T
his is not the kind game that
our section would usually
review. In fact, when I told
my fellow games editor
Calum what I was planning
to write about, he retorted in disgust
“that’s not a proper game!” However,
I believe that mobile gaming is here
to stay, which means that we should
start considering them. Also, the
addictiveness of QuizUp could not be
discounted.
So for all of those of you who do
not know what this game is, let me
quickly give you the low down on this
super app. It’s a free game created by
Plan Vanilla Corp which is currently
only on iOS. Basically a trivia quiz, it
encompasses more than 350 topics for
you to show off your knowledge. You
subject you level up in.
Considering that each game lasts
maximum a minute, and you almost
immediately know if you are going
to win it is a great way to kill a few
minutes if you are waiting.
So why do I think that you should get
this app? Well its free (you can pay for
experience boosts if you really want
to), it’s a great way to learn random
facts that you may never encounter at
Imperial (like the only beer that Ernest
Hemmingway endorsed in his life),
and it’s a great ice-breaker (I mean, if
you are too awkward to actually ask
someone out, you could always ask
them on a subject that implies what
you want). Come all you quizmasters
out there, time to answer ALL the
questions!
answer 7 multiple choice questions in
a game, attempting to answer as fast
as possible.
The longer it takes for you to answer
the less points you get for the answer.
However the twist is that you play can
real-timeversusothersontheInternet,
challenging for title of greatest know-
it-all across the globe. Furthermore if
you link your Facebook account to the
game you can play your friends! This
competitive element does add a lot to
me wanting to play.
Another element that adds to the
compulsive nature of the game is
the levelling and experience that
accompany each result after a round
of the quiz. Not only can you show off
your supremeness of your brain, but
you can also gain titles related to the
