1985 - The Mayor of Rome and the
Mayor of Tunis meet to official end
the 3rd Punic War after 2,131 years.
Unfortunately it lasts only 3 minutes
when the Mayor and Rome rejects the
Mayor of Tunis’ high five.
1971 - In an event everyone agrees
is “sooo 1969” astronauts land on the
moon again. Yawn.
1958 - In a careless move, the US
Air Force loses a hydrogen bomb off
Georgia -fucking idiots.
1947 - The lowest recorded
temperature in North America is
made in the Yukon, making you doubt
why you bothered reading this far in
the first place.
1637 - Collapse of Tulip Mania in the
Netherlands. However, this editor
feels sure their warehouse of bulbs will
skyrocketing in value any day now.
1238 - As per their M.O., the Mongols
burn shit in Europe.

TUBE-DITORIAL
New Distance-Course To Have Most Contact Hours

ollowing the announcement
of plans to create a long-
distance MBA programme
at the Imperial Business
School, Hangman can
confirm that the course will contain
far more contact hours and face-
to-face tutorials than any current
Imperial course.
A spokesperson for the Business
In a controversial decision this week,
the Felix Section Hangman rudely
declined an enthusiastic lonely hearts
column aimed at its editor.
Whilst many would simply have
ignored an undesired proposition,
Hangman has decided cruelly take it
apart in an arrogant, self-referential
column.
The proposition, a ludicrous attempt
to snag a handsome, charming and
witty section editor, was roundly
mocked for its naive ethuasiasm and
hopeful desperation.
All the blame, however cannot
be placed on the author of the ad.
Hangman feels the need to state that
the idea of a lonely hearts column is
“both sad and frantic” attempt by the
Features section to gain a few extra
readers.
A spokesperson for Hangman added
“we do not negotiate with trollers”.
School stated “as well as their
mandatory iPad, new students on the
long distance course will also have
their tutors flown out to wherever
they are in the world”.
“we will, of course, also send out
Imperial’s best Marquee providers to
build a Marquee around the student”.
“That way, they will get the full
Imperial experience”.
It is unclear as yet if Imperial will be
sending representatives of Ernst and
Young or Deutsche Bank directly to

ollowing the outrage
this week at the London
Underground strike, this
editor believes that all
transport workers, private
and public, should go on strike next
week.
This writer has to agree with the
motives of the tube strikers, who were
brave enough to stand up and say
what everyone was thinking, namely
that everyone in London who takes
any form of transport - bus, taxi,
rickshaw or tube - is, most probably,
a bit of a shit.
Therefore, it seems only logical that
pissing-off these bastards off should
be any decent Londoner’s number one
priority.
In fact, when you combine this with
that recent news that around 50% of
adult Londoners are obese, it seems
only logical to make these fat tossers
walk to their desired destination.
So, keep the bus doors closed, leave
your taxi in your garage and take ride
your-one person bike. Because we
need to teach these slobbering, burger-
obsessed, ungrateful Londoners a
lesson.
Felix In The Past - we were going
to run a reminder of how foolish the 2011-12
editor was to include a Valentine’s Day rohypnol
recipe. However our cowardly editor wouldn’t
risk his arse to condemn the trivialisation of
rape, shame on him. (If you’re a fresher, ask a
hall senior for the juicy deets).

However, the Business School
confirmed that the students would, at

all the major companies that form the
