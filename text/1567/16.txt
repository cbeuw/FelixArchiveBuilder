T
he Friday Lates are, much as
the name suggests, a series
of exhibitions that take place
on a Friday night, specifically
the last Friday of each
month. The content is purposefully
chosen to be very different from what
one might expect to be displayed in
the V&A – this most recent Friday
Late, on the 31st of January, was
curated by Boiler Room, a somewhat
hard to describe entity.
Boiler Room, the brainchild of
Blaise Bellville, started life as a
guest-list only club night in Dalston
that showcased the best of London’s
underground electronic music scene
by streaming a live TV feed online
for every performance. It grew
in importance and repute until it
became the big name in the scene,
and now has offices in New York,
Berlin and Los Angeles. Importantly,
it has branched out from streaming
performances, and now takes part
in all kinds of cultural music based
forums, including Friday Late.
ThefirstthingInoticeduponwalking
into the V&A from the Exhibition
Road entrance was how surreal it was
to be surrounded by beautiful marble
sculptures of nymphs and classical
era gods and goddesses, while having
my ears bombarded with sounds
very much on the experimental edge
of London’s electronic music scene.
The theme of the evening can very
loosely be summed up as “exploring
the relationships between spaces,
technology and sound”, and the
first exhibit I saw was the Bristol
collective Emptyset’s piece, Medium.
Set outside in the John Madejski
Garden, and displayed on a large
LED screen with several speakers,
the piece used semi-static images of
the gothic Woodchester Mansion and
harsh static to change the area into a
grim and foreboding place, in sharp
contrast to the brightly lit, opulent
and warm museum interior.
Next I came to the grand entrance
where the boiler room set itself was
underway, and after a short dance,
(making sure to get myself in the
way of the cameras filming for the
online stream) I made my way to the
nearby Medieval and Renaissance
Room where electronic musicians
Bill Kouligas and Mat Dryhurst,
joined in their conviction that live
streaming will become its own
expressive medium, were performing
live manipulation of the boiler room
audio. Most interesting about this
exhibit was how organic it was; the
distance from the boiler room was
small enough such that you could
still just about hear the original,
while listening to the abstract mix
produced unrehearsed by the two
musicians. They were chatting to each
other, dancing to their own modified
beats and talking to and encouraging
members of the audience to “get
their funk on”. It was unpretentious
fun, created by two people with real
interest in what they were doing.
Journeying now to the highest
level of the V&A, and into the very
comfortableLydiaandManfredGorvy
lecture theatre, my favourite exhibit
of the night, called London Modular,
were creating the kind of noises
that make you make that face. Four
enormous modular synths were being
programmed live to create some truly
beautiful music, while informative
slides were on loop via projector.
The best part came when they used
analogue synthesis to produce
chaotic noise via a series of non-linear
dynamical equations, and then used
digital logic gates to decide which
noise to filter. They dealt with the
infinitesimal point at which a system
changes from deterministic to truly
chaotic, which, as a mathematician,
I found particularly interesting. After
the performance we were encouraged
to go and poke around with the synths
and ask any questions we may have,
and the enthusiasm of all involved
was truly heart-warming.
There was so many exhibits I didn’t
have chance to see on the night, but
the sheer inventiveness and variety
of those that I did, along with the £0
entry fee, means I would recommend
next month’s Friday Late to anyone,
regardless of its subject matter.
V&A’s Boiler Room
Under The Vaults
Fred Fyles goes underground as part of
the Waterloo Vaults Festival
W
hen I take my
seat in the
slightly cramped,
u n d e r g r o u n d
theatre that
makes up one of the venues of the
Vault Festival, I am not just sitting
in a room 10 metres below Waterloo
Station; I am instead inhabiting the
space between ‘sanity and death’.
At least, this is what we are told by
Michelle Roche, whose monologue
‘I Grew Up In An Old Person’s Home’
details what her life was like as a young
person whose parents converted
their house into a care home for the
elderly. Over the course of 45 minutes
we find out all about the adventures,
incidents, and personal tragedies that
went on under that roof.
Roche, who appears alone on
the stage, bar the company of
four precariously strung teacups,
cuts an instantly likeable figure.
Joyful and expressive, she bounces
across the stage, acting out various
characters from her childhood; we
are introduced to the elderly Scottish
gentleman who bellows folk songs
at the top of his lungs, and Tiger,
the former mountain climber who is
now confined to her bed, fed a series
of mashed up meals. Roche looks
back at the world with rose-tinted
spectacles, reminiscing that she
never experienced any tragedy, never
noticed when one of the residents
had died; and yet, the production
is tinged with a current of regret
and pathos that runs to its core.
Nearly all the residents of the home
had Alzheimer’s, that most horrific
of disorders that robs a person of
their memories and reasoning, and
in one of the play’s most startling
scenes Roche acts out a conversation
between an elderly woman and her
visiting son, whom she no longer
recognises. Flitting from character to
character, Roche transitions between
states of excitement, hope, and
depression at the drop of a hat.
However, while the acting may be
great, the play somewhat falters on
its scripting, which has a tendency to
lack pace, giving the play a somewhat
sluggish feel. Emphasising the warped
experiences of dementia patients,
who have lost the ability to perceive
reality, and the repetitious nature
of caring for them, Roche repeats
certain scenes and conversations
multiple times. Sometimes they are
at different speeds, but mostly they
are delivered with exactly the same
tone and intonation. While this
might have not been a problem in
a production with multiple actors,
or in a longer piece, in the context
of this performance they somewhat
grate, creating a jarring experience.
But then again, this could have
been the intention of Roche all along;
nevertheless, the most impressive
parts of the monologue come when
Roche is whipped up into a childlike
frenzy, describing her life with
aplomb.
It can be difficult to convincingly
describe what life is like for the
elderly in our society, who are often
denied a voice, or – in the case of
Alzheimer’s – not really able to speak
for themselves. Roche’s expressive
phrases seem to capture all the joy
and despair that come with living in
an old people’s home; she talks about
the fun she used to have with the
residents, and in the next line delivers
cutting remarks about their ‘paper-
thin skin’, that can only make you feel
a profound sense of pity.
For me, the most arresting moment
came when Roche describes what
happened when a childhood friend
came over to the house; she describes
all that happened in a blur of words,
becoming more and more excited,
and then, when she repeats the story
more slowly, it seems to dawn on her
how terrifying her friend would have
found the experience. This change
from wonder to horror is a subtle
one that Roche manages to pull off
without a hitch.
At the beginning of the production,
we are told that the wall behind us is
the ‘sane world’, where we have all of
our memories, and we know what’s
what, while the back of the stage
represents ‘death’. Roche invites us
into the twilight zone, between these
two worlds, giving us a glimpse –
albeit short – into life as an elderly
person; it is a difficult piece to pull
off, but Roche manages to show us the
world of her childhood, one of cups
of tea, snowstorms, and nostalgia.
The Vault Festival is a 6 week arts
and entertainment festival with over
60 events. It is running 28th January
– 8th March, under the tunnels at
Waterloo station. Admission to the
