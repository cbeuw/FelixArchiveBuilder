FRIDAY 07 FEB
COMMENT
F
or most of my time as a
GTA here, I have stuck very
securely to the undergrads.
These are people I may not
always like but at least I
know where they are coming from. I
have been there. I have experienced
the peaks and troughs (or more
likely deep underwater trenches) of
undergrad life.
With the MScs, however, it is
different. They make more exotic and
hard to find GTA work than 3rd year
undergrads. Their courses are an awful
lot smaller (lowering their sighting
chances) and they are only taught by
certain departments (lowering the
habitats).
Due to their rarity they also hang
around in one big group and when
threatened by countless undergrads
generally stake out some sort of
back room not many people know
about and claim it as theirs. As my
supervisor is not really involved with
them, I had assumed that was that for
me, but somehow early this term I
talked my way into one.
I was not really sure what to expect,
but prepped the notes as usual, on the,
um… night before. When I walked
into the room something immediately
hit me: lack of smell. To be fair to the
undergrads some of the ventilation in
the lecture halls is really terrible, but
to be honest after they have been in a
confined space for an hour or two, it
is not always the nicest place to enter.
Also the MSc faces looking back at
me were kind of old. Not gnarly or
anything, but older definitely than me
which was off putting especially know
I was trying to help people who had
much, much more experience than
me.
Before long I had my first question,
where a pair of students (who had
checked with each other first, which
was weird) did not understand the
question. I explained and was thanked
politely and not as an afterthought
which was nice. This was a prequel
Confessions of a GTA: Part 10
to a question about how you would
apply this technique in “real life”. I
mean they weren’t even interested in
where to get marks, but my somewhat
surprised explanation was again
thanked and the person retreated to
“check an answer with a friend”. And
Talking to MSc students can be highly disconcerting
The GTA
Anonymous
the questions kept on coming: “Could
you help me understand this bit in the
notes?”, “I understand the question
but what is the best way to start out
of our two?” and even “Could you tell
me about an extra book you found
helpful?”
So my confession this week is,
although it was a refreshing change
from the constant “Will we get a
question like this in an exam?”, to be
honest talking to other people who
cared about your subject was highly
disconcerting.
