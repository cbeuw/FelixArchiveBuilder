This week, in a pathetic attempt
to improve your nonexistent
love life, you send an ad into
the Felix lonely hearts. Upon
opening the paper you see the
perfect ad and send a reply
straight away only to realise
you had, in fact, picked out
your own ad like the narcissistic
dickhead you are.
This week you attempt to
best the weather and make
a dash for uni without an
umbrella. Angered by your
defiance the weather-gods
send a large gust of wind to
sweep you into the Thames
and downstream to a place
worse than hell - Southend-
on-Sea
Because of the tube strike
this week you decide to walk
in. However, you wake-up
morning-of to find you have
no limbs. Panicking, you try
jump out of bed but succeed
only in rolling your blob-
like torso onto the bedroom
floor. The hall cleaners fail
to notice your presence and
you spend the rest of your life
inside a hoover-bag.
This week you decide to do
something productive and
fill out the Felix Sex Survey.
However, after filling it out
honestly and admitting you
had never even seen a
woman at Imperial, the survey
marks you as a troll and you
are forever banned from all
Imperial networks.
This week you download
Flappy Bird and play so well
you decide to continuously rub
your flatmate’s face in it. You
fail to realise the repercussions
the full force of which you only
realise when you stick in your
disgusting ear plugs before
bed and die like the dick you
are.
This week, you start dating
Mick Jaggers’ ex-wife. Finally,
you’ve hit the big time and can
quit your boring job at as a
geneticist a low life university.
Before you can do that,
however, your brutish Biology
undergrads, in frustration at
their own stupidity, beat you to
death with a zebrafish.
This week you get annoyed
that people aren’t uploading
data for coursework write-ups
quickly enough. Unable to find
out their names , you go on an
indiscriminate murderous ram-
page through the university.
Eventually, you are kicked out
of uni on sexism grounds when
your iPod shuffles through to
Blurred Lines.
This week, your failed attempts
to seduce the Hangman section
mean you reconsider your anti-
Travel opinions and fly out to
Mexico to pursue potential soul-
mates. Upon arrival, you realise
that no amount of Caribbean
love can replace your one true
love - the Hangman section.
You find a cave and live out
your days as a hermit.
This week you get nominated
for a Neknomination. As you
consider yourself “one of
the lads” you down 2 litres
of Sainsbury’s Basics Gin
in your mankini. Your violent
vomiting dislodges your
skimpy attire reveling all.
However, since no one has
a magnifying glass on them,
no one noticed.
Mistakenly believing the 14th
of February to be April Fools
day you dress up as fish and
attempt to scare passers-by.
By coincidence, a guy with a
fish fetish asks you to dinner
at FiveSixEight’s Valentine’s
evening. Little that he knows
that fishy smell isn’t part of the
costume. All’s well that ends
well, eh?
Fed up of another Friday night
spent at home you decide to
seize the initiative and take the
bus into the buzzing hub of
Soho. Upon arrival, you stumble
across all your friends and class
mates in an up-and-coming
bar. As you’re a fresher, you fail
to realise the social implications
and join them anyway, ruining
everyone’s night
This week you download
Flappy Bird and can’t
get through the first gate.
Meanwhile your flatmate sets
a ridiculously high score. In
revenge you poison his ear
plugs, steal his phone and
claim the score as yours.
Finally, a win.

F
ollowing the sacking of
Michael Laudrup as Swansea
manager this week, the club
have clarified the reasons for
his departure.
Stating that the club was “over-
running the future plans for success”,
a spokesperson for Swansea City
football explained why the sacked a
cup-winning manager.
“we felt that, due to the current rate of
success, we would be unable to parcel
out the successes in a way forseen by
our future panning committee” w
“Essentially, winning a cup
competition in his first season in
charge was not in the five year plan we
outlined for Laudrup and thus he had
to go”
Burger Becomes Sole Food-Stuff
M
ayor of London,
Boris Johnson,
has confirmed
this week that all
London shop-
fronts are to become up
market burger joints by 2017.
A spokesman for the Mayor’s office
stated “In recent years there has been a
sharp decline in High-street shopping
- mainly due to online retailers”
“we have also noticed a
sharp rise in American-style
burger joints across the city”
“As such, our only logical step was
to turn all current shop-fronts into
burger joints as soon as possible”
“I mean just look at the numbers,
it’s obvious that setting up a wanky,
expensiveburgerjointistheonlyviable
business-model for central London”
“I mean don’t forget, soon the only
people left in London will be the
kind rich dicks who can afford to
regularly spend £10 on a burger”
The proposal received bipartisan
support from all London councils
and will be immediately instituted.
