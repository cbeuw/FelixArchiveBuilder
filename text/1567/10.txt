asking Syria to deal with its chemical
weapon stockpiles. However, the way
Russia has been behaving domestically
has been questionable to say the least.
Human rights issues and a lack of
free speech allows Russia to be open
to major scrutiny. If Russia wishes
to make the unnecessarily expensive
Olympic games successful, it has to
change the way it has been behaving
both domestically and internationally.

Russia and the situation in Ukraine

U
kraine has been
currently going through
a very tumultuous
period with protests
and rioting in various
parts of the country. The interest of
the Russian government in Ukraine
may have a grave impact on the Sochi
Winter Olympics and lead to further
scrutiny of the Putin government
by western powers and the world
media. Thus, Putin has to be very
careful about what steps he takes
internationally, more so now than
ever before.
Ukraine has been going through
intense ever since President
Yanukovich suspended trade talks
with the EU (Ed: sic). These trade
agreements would have eased off some
travel restrictions that the country
had been facing in mainland Europe.
The free trade agreement would have
allowed the movement of machinery
and transport equipment as well as
other goods to the country, which
would have boosted its manufacturing
industry tremendously. Furthermore,
Ukraine would have been able to
further its export of iron, steel, mining
as well as agricultural products to
the EU bringing in much needed
foreign currency. The general public
supported the trade agreement and
as a result, the suspension has led
to bitter resentment amongst the
Ukrainian people. So why did Kiev
suspend this trade agreement even
though they knew stalling such a move
could have been a political disaster?
Vladmir Putin has been bitterly
opposed to this trade agreement from
the outset. Thus, there was a threat
of a loss of trade with Russia if the
Ukranian government becomes more
involved with the EU. The official
statement from President Yanukovich,
according to the BBC, is that Ukraine
could not afford to sacrifice trade with
Russia. This may have been true to an
extent due to the links that Ukraine
has had with Russia in the past. The
relationships between Russia and
Ukraine have been well established
from the time of the Soviet Union
and although the Union has been
dismantled, a large proportion of the
links still remain. The statement by
the President may have played against
people’s emotions due to the atrocities
and prejudices faced by them under
Soviet rule in the past. The idea of
having their independent government
bow down to Russian pressure may
bring back some bitter resentment.
However, there is evidence to
believe there is more to this situation.
Ukraine is said to be “the most
corrupt nation in Europe” according
to Transparency International. People
are seen to be dissatisfied with the
current establishment and would
also like systematic change. The
idea that Ukraine is falling under
Russian pressure may be blamed on
the fact that it currently has a weak
and corrupt establishment. Since the
government has too strong a desire to
remain in power, it would rather bow
down to Russian economic pressure
and sanctions than follow what is good
for the nation as a whole. This has
added further fuel to the protests and
the opposition has been supporting
the protestors for trying to tackle
the current establishment. However,
the government has not been willing
to listen and has been threatening
stringent actions if the protestors do
not leave the government buildings.
The police has already been very
brutal in its way of tackling the
protestors and may not listen to the
people’s demands anytime soon.
The Russian establishment has
shown bitter resentment against the
EU trade agreements for a number of
reasons. The official statement claims
that the free trade agreement could
be a ‘big threat’ to Moscow. This is
because; the goods from Europe could
be flooded into Moscow virtually
without tariffs due to the free trade
agreement between Moscow and Kiev.
This, according to Putin, would cause
Russia’s car, agriculture and aviation
industries to suffer. The damage
to the Russian industry, however,
will not be as large as it would be
towards his ego. A lot of rules and
regulations can be put in place to
maintain Russian industry, which the
Russian authorities can be able to
maintain. There are also reasons to
believe that Putin may be against the
trade agreements for personal gains.
Putin has a desire for Ukraine to join
the customs union, which includes
Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. By
enhancing the union, Putin wishes
to expand Russia’s influence in the
region.
The politics of pressure and
sanctions, however, is not one, which
a modern nation should follow to
expand its field of influence. The
idea that Russia wishes to divide the
nations in an archaic, post First World
War fashion
seems to be
disconnected
from the
modern form
of diplomacy.
Furthermore,
Vladmir Putin
has to be careful
about the steps
he takes due to
the upcoming
Sochi Winter
Olympics.
C l e a r l y ,
Russia wishes
to establish
itself as a very
i n f l u e n t i a l
power and
has been
m o d e r a t e l y
successful in
doing so. As
a supporter
of the Assad
regime and
having signed
oil agreements
with Iran,
Russia has
been expanding
its sphere of
influence in the
Arab world.
Furthermore,
by signing
free trade
a g r e e m e n t s
with China,
Russia has been
able to make
itself an active
member in
world affairs.
To further show
its strength, Russia has decided to
hold the Winter Olympics in Sochi, a
fond holiday resort of Vladmir Putin.
These Olympics have already been
marked with serious controversy
with local wildlife and population
being dispersed. People have been
forcibly evicted from their homes for
development purposes. Furthermore,
the whole project has been seen to
be rampant with corruption with a
large proportion of spending being
diverted elsewhere. The games have
been proclaimed to be even more
expensive than the Beijing Olympics
but how much of these expenses have
been efficiently spent is questionable.
Locals have not been satisfied with
the construction process and have
blamed the authorities for disrupting
their lifestyle and putting their futures
in jeopardy for the sake of ensuring a
successful Olympic event.
Russia has been trying to clean
its image by allowing certain
political prisoners, such as Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, to be released and
