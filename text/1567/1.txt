A
London Student
investigation found
Imperial College
London has the most
invested in the arms
industry. Compared with ten other
London universities, Imperial’s
holdings in defence companies comes
out on top with investments totalling
£3.9m. A Freedom of Information
request found the college has shares
in four defence manufacturers
Imperial College has £1.75 million
worth of shares in General Electric
(GE), one of the biggest arms-
producing companies in the world.
A recent report in the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI) ranked GE 18th in its top 100
list of arms-producing and military
services companies. The company
supplies the necessary technology for
combat aircraft, military transport,
helicopters and drones. GE have
previously claimed that their arms
production “provide the necessary
power and reliability for any military
application. GE’s engines are proven
in service and continue to operate in
critical missions around the world.”
The college has a £922,000 stake in
Inmarsat, a global telecommunication
that has close ties to the US defence
community. Inmarsat are proud
to provide “rapid, secure and
reliable access to mission-critical
information.” Imperial College has
£489,000 worth of shares in Texas
Instruments, a company that entered
defence electronics market in 1942.
Texas Instruments produce the
“latest technology, manufacturing
capability and product mix for
advanced and critical aerospace and
military applications.” The college
has a further £753,000 stake in Rolls
Royce, a company that is more likely
to bring to mind flash cars than
fighter jets and nuclear submarines,
yet Rolls Royce is the 2nd Largest
Manufacturer of Aerospace Engines
powering approximately 25% of the
world’s military aircraft and has its
equipment installed on over 2,200
warships including all of the UK’s
nuclear submarines.
Tara Clarke of Fossil Free Imperial
said: “I worry about my university’s
support of the arms industry who
deals to countries with worrying
civil rights records and regimes that
repress democracy.
In a university with a centre of
research for blast injuries, it doesn’t
make sense to support an industry
which creates these injuries in the first
place.”
Holly-Rae Smith of Campaign
against Arms Trade told London
Student: “Quite often, students have
no say in what their university invests
in. It’s quite secretive. Student’s tuition
fees end up invested in companies
they consider unethical.”
Supporters point out that many
of these companies are involved in a
wide range of products, not just those
associated with defence. GE, though
one of the biggest arms producing
companies in the world, produces
the majority of the world’s electronic
devices including everyday light bulbs
to fuel cell technology.
Felix asked College yesterday if
they had any comments on the issue.
A College spokesperson stated,
“Imperial’s Endowment Board
manages those College assets that
are not essential to the core academic
mission of the College and that can
therefore be managed with a pure
investment focus, with the aim of
supporting Imperial’s research and
teaching activities.
The Board’s Terms of Reference
include an obligation to maintain a
diversified portfolio of investments,
to have regard to the suitability of
the investments within this portfolio
and to manage the investments in
a way that is appropriate to achieve
the investment objectives set by the
College’s Council”.
