esearchers from the
University of Delaware
have developed a new
catalyst that may reduce
the surplus carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. The
proposed nano-porous silver catalyst
encourages the conversion of carbon
dioxide into carbon monoxide.
While initially this may not sound
like a victory, it is simply the first step;
the carbon monoxide produces can
be fed as a reactant in the Fischer-
Tropsch process, which is used to
create synthetic fuels.
Carbon dioxide is one of the most
abundant greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere, but the concentration of
thegasisontheincrease.Animportant
area of research at the moment is
capturing surplus carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere and converting it into
less harmful products. Doing this in an
efficient way is still a major challenge
for sustainable energy research.
Commonly, a silver catalyst is the
choice material when reacting carbon
dioxide due to the high selectivity
and relatively low cost. Additionally,
the inorganic nature of silver means
it remains stable under high reaction
conditions. Previous research studied
the effects of using low potentials on
silver particles in ionic electrolytes.
However, the cost of liquid
electrolytes, as well as their sensitivity
moisture means that there is room for
improvement.
The researchers found that with
switching from a commonly used
polycrystalline to their novel nano-
porous silver electro catalyst structure
efficiency achieved rose to 92%, an
important success for the project.
Feng Jiao, an assistant professor
of chemical and biochemical
engineering, led the project, which

created the catalyst structure with
an extremely large surface
area (150 times greater
than its polycrystalline
counterpart) and the
curved surface means there
are a high number of active
sites (at least 20 times
more than polycrystalline).
This resulted in a reaction
activity three orders of
magnitude higher, and with
only a moderate potential
of less than 500 mV.
“[The] selective
conversion of carbon
dioxide to carbon
monoxide is a promising
route for clean energy but
it is a technically difficult
process to accomplish,”
Jiao said. “We’re hopeful
that the catalyst we have
developed can pave the way
toward future advances in
this area.”

here are few scientific
techniques that have had
such an enormous influence
across so many disciplines
as crystallography.
In the past 100 years, it has led to
no fewer than 28 Nobel Prizes for
discoveries from right across the
natural sciences, and remains one
the best ways we have of determining
the nanoscale structure of everything
from proteins to microprocessors.
In an effort to raise awareness
of the technique’s extraordinary
achievements, the UN has named
2014 the International Year of
Crystallography. The year was
selected to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the award of the Nobel
Prize in physics to Max von Laue, who
first discovered that X-rays could be
diffracted by crystals.
Just a year later, the prize went to
William Henry Bragg and his son
William Lawrence for developing
this technique to discover crystal
structures. By firing X-rays directly
at a crystal and observing the pattern
they make as they pass through, they
could determine the spacing between
the layers of the crystal lattice, and its
overall structure.
The crystal acts a bit like a diffraction
grating, with the waves being spread
out by the spaces between atoms. For
the waves to be diffracted, they need to
have a wavelength as close as possible
to the atomic spacing (a few hundred
picometres), which is why X-rays
are ideal. However, other particles,
including neutrons and electrons, are
also sometimes used.
X-ray diffraction crystallography
has given us a detailed understanding
of much more complex molecules
than the simple lattices the Braggs first
looked at. Its most famous discovery
came in 1953, at King’s College
London, as a team led by Rosalind
Franklin and Maurice Wilkins were
trying to analyse DNA using X-rays.
One of the biggest problems faced
by Franklin and Wilkins was trying
to create perfect crystals from DNA
samples. Large molecules, like DNA
or proteins, have to be extremely pure
before they will crystallise, and it often
takes weeks or months to get a good
enough crystal to form.
Eventually, they managed to produce
an image of the molecule that allowed
Francis Crick and James Watson,
working under Lawrence Bragg in
Cambridge, to establish the shape of
the DNA double helix.
Since then, crystallography has been
widely used to
determine the
structures of
a huge variety
of biological
molecules. In the
1950s and 60s,
Dorothy Hodgkin
became the first
to determine
the structure
of vitamin B12
and penicillin,
winning the 1963
Nobel Prize in
chemistry for her
discoveries.
Even today, it’s
still one of the
best techniques
we have of
determining the
structure of large
molecules; one of
the main uses of
the £300 million
Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire,
the UK’s national synchrotron facility,
is to generate extremely intense X-rays
for use in crystallography.
In structural biology, major
discoveries can be made about the
behaviour of, say, a protein or virus, by
getting a very detailed understanding
of its shape. Just a few years ago, in
2009, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
was awarded for the discovery of
the structure of the ribosome, the
apparatus in cells that makes proteins,
using the technique.
But despite this list of achievements,
crystallography remains relatively
unknown outside scientific circles.
Perhaps the International Year
of Crystallography will help it be
rightfully seen as one of the most
important techniques in science.
