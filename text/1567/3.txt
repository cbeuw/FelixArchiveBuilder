mperial College has published
a new “Action plan for world
class animal research”. This
follows allegations made last
April by the British Union for
the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV)
that the College was involved in
unethical animal research. This led
to College setting up an independent
committee – led by Professor Steve
Brown, Director of the Medical
Research Council’s Mammalian
Genetics Unit at Harwell – to
investigate the treatment of animals
at Imperial.
Reporting in December, the com-
mittee “commended the College’s
animal care staff and the standards
of husbandry” but criticised the sup-
port and leadership structure in the
field of animal research. Professor
Brown commented that: “Our inves-
tigation identified a number of seri-
ous concerns on the conduct, man-
agement and oversight of animal
research at Imperial College. ... Im-
perial College is internationally rec-
ognised as one of the world’s best re-
search institutes and it is important
that this is matched by its standards
of animal use and welfare.”
The College has says that it fully
accepts the findings of the Brown
Report and that the new Action Plan
takes into account its Brown’s rec-
ommendations. The Plan focuses on
strengthening the College’s commit-
ment to the “replacement, reduction
and refinement of the use of animals
in research (3Rs)”, with animals only
being used in research “when there
is no alternative, and when their use
is shown to be essential for creating
new knowledge, making scientific
and medical advances and develop-
ing new treatments”.
The College has committed to re-
cruiting a new Director of Bioser-
vices and the formation of a Central
Biomedical Services (CBS) Board.
The Director and Board will oversee
all research involving animals. They
will be responsible for making such
research more open and account-
able, and putting in place a stronger
ethical review process. They will
also liaise with the existing Animal
Welfare and Ethical Review Body
(AWERB), which will be given new
staff and have its remit strength-
ened. Sub-branches of the AWERB
will also be established in individual
labs and research groups to allow
closer contact with researchers. It
is hoped that this new support and
oversight structure will help staff
working with animals identify how
to best achieve the 3Rs and ensure
that the highest standards of ani-
mal welfare are maintained. Special
training will be also be provided to
make staff understand the impor-
tance of staying within the terms of

Imperial College publishes
animal research action plan in
responce to cruelty allegations
the Home Office animal experimen-
tation licenses.
The Report states that the College
hopes that these changes will benefit
“Imperial’s aim of being an inter-
national leader in animal research”,
which it considers to be “essential
for improving human and animal
health and welfare”. The CBS board
has been instructed to produce a re-
port by the end of the year detailing
the College’s progress towards these
goals.
Professor Dermot Kelleher, Dean
of Imperial’s Faculty for Medicine
and Vice President (Health), said:
“In the past few months we have en-
gaged widely in search of best prac-
tice for managing world-leading,
complex multi-site animal research
facilities. I am grateful to colleagues
across the UK for sharing their ex-
pert advice and hope that our action
plan may also help the broader com-
munity in strengthening its work
in this area. Imperial’s new action
plan will change the culture towards
animal research at the College, by
improving the way we manage this
work in a clear, accountable and
transparent way, finding more ways
of applying the 3Rs, and strengthen-
ing our investment in how we assess
and review research proposals. Our
aim remains to deliver world class
research for the benefit of humans
and animals, whilst treating all our
animals with full respect and the
highest standards of care.”
C
ircassia, a spinoff
company from an
Imperial lab discovery in
2006 has announced that
it plans to float on the
London Stock Exchange. It hopes to
raise approximately £175 million in
the initial public offering.
Carissa is Imperial Innovation’s
largest portfolio company, it is a
biopharmaceutical company at
clinical-stage. Imperial Innovations
has a 19.7% equity stake in Circassia.
Carissa develops immunotherapy
products to treat different allergies,
such as to cats and grass. ToleroMune
is the novel technology that has been
used to create the products.
The money raised will be used to
commence the final stage of clinical
testing for some of the products, as
well as to pay for the market launch of
the cat allergy products.
Circassia’s chairman Dr Francesco
Granata said: “This IPO is a logical
step in the evolution of the Company
as we seek to exploit fully our assets
and prepare for commercial launch of
our lead product, Cat-SPIRE”
The CEO of Imperial innovations,
Russ Cummings said: “Circassia
is a great example of our business
model in action, supporting UK
science and research alongside this
high calibre management team and
Board. Circassia benefits from a
strong group of existing investors
and this listing creates an excellent
opportunity to build a leading UK-
based biopharmaceutical company
which is addressing a substantial and
growing international market.
The announcement of Circassia's
intention to float on the Main
Market in London follows the recent
NASDAQ IPO of Oxford Immunotec,
illustrating the considerable strength
in depth and maturing of our
portfolio."
