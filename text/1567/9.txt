A
gene-editing technique
that has taken the
world by storm over
the past year has for
the first time been
carried out in primates, hinting at the
potential for more accurate models of
human diseases like Alzheimer’s.
The CRISPR/Cas9 method is based
on a naturally occurring phenomenon
in bacteria, which acts as an antiviral
immune system by using short
stretches of RNA to target viral
genomes for destruction.
BecausetheCas9proteinresponsible
for cutting the DNA is guided to its
target by RNA, the sequence of the
RNA can be specifically designed
to cut a specific part of the genome,
allowing specific genes to be targeted.
Once cut, the gene can be knocked out
or replaced with a slightly different
copy.
The ease with which this method
can be used to knock out genes,
or to replace faulty genes with
healthy copies, has led to many
potential applications, including in
biotechnology and food production. A
recent publication created over 18,000
human cell lines, each with a different
gene removed, while the time taken to
produce a mouse with a gene knocked
out has been slashed from months to a
matter of weeks.
Mice are commonly used for
investigating human disease, but in
many cases the biological systems are
too different to act as a meaningful
model. This is particularly true
in neuroscience, where research
into disorders such as autism and
schizophrenia relies on behavioural
analysis, which can be difficult in
mice.
These latest results, published in
Cell, show for the first time that this
mechanism works in whole primates,
not just in cell lines. This development
bringsaboutthepotentialforknocking
out specific genes in primates, giving
more realistic models of human
disease. By targeting genes involved in
diseases such as Parkinson’s disease,
our understanding of how this disease
develops and how it may be treated
could be greatly increased.
However, using primates brings with
it many problems. Keeping a primate
is much more expensive and time-
consuming than housing mice, and
researchers working on non-human
primates have regularly been the
target of anti-vivisection protestors.
While it is possible for a single
institution to contain mouse models
for many diseases, each with a
different gene removed, it is hard to
imagine many universities having the
space or budget to house many non-
human primate models.
It remains to be seen just how
the new technology affects the use
of primates in research. Currently
available methods for knocking out
genes in primates rely on infection
with a virus, giving unpredictable
and inefficient results. This new
technology give a more accurate,
cheaper and faster way of removing
genes, which could make primate
research much more efficient.
An alternative to using primate
models is to grow human cells or
tissues in the lab and target these.
Whilst these will not fully recapitulate
the disease as seen in the whole
body, the fact that they are made up
of human cells is a huge advantage,
helping to avoid many of the ethical
problems posed by animal models
and potentially giving a more realistic
model of the disease.

‘D
i s a p p e a r i n g
ink’ generally
conjures up
images of spies
and secret
messages. Until now, attempts to
create a disappearing ink have been
expensive (and sometimes toxic), with
the results appearing rather faint on
the page. But researchers from China
have come up with a solution that uses
nothing but plain old water.
The secret, though, lies in the paper.
The team came up with a special
kind of coating which changes colour
when it reacts with water. Over time
the water evaporates and the dye
becomes invisible again, meaning the
paper is completely reusable. At room
temperature, the paper would dry out
in just under a day. At 70C, the ink
disappears in just 30 seconds.
Importantly, the technology can
be used with existing inkjet printers
- the team simply replaced the ink in
a printer cartridge with water using
a syringe. A single sheet of paper can
be re-used up to 50 times, and based
on this sort of usage the technology
would be a mere 1% of the cost of
standard inkjet printing.
The process used to treat the paper
does make it slightly more expensive,
but only around 5% more so than
normal paper, meaning overall the
technology is very cost-effective.
As well as being cheap, using a
technology like this in offices and
schools would have significant
benefits for the environment.
According to some studies, up to 40%
of office prints are thrown away after
just one reading, so water-jet printing
would also save reams of paper and
thousands of trees.
At the moment, the printers can
only produce one colour at a time,
from a selection of blue, magenta,
gold and purple. From pictures of the
group’s first attempts, writing looks
clear and accurate - certainly good
enough for general use. The next step
will be to improve the resolution, and
to enable the printing multiple colours
for images.
