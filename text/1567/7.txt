Graduate opportunities in Consulting and Technology
We are in business to help our clients
achieve higher performance. It’s why we’re
recognised as one of the leading management
consulting, technology services and
outsourcing companies in the world today.
To us, transforming businesses, charities and
governments across the globe means helping
clients get better at what they do – and
that gets us excited. We also believe that
helping people evolve themselves and their
careers depends on us equipping people
to learn, grow, innovate and inspire those
around them.
By joining us as an Analyst within our Analyst
Consulting Group (ACG) or as a Software
Engineer with Accenture Technology Solutions
(ATS), you’ll discover this firsthand. As a guide
to help you decide, our Analysts must have
a strong interest in technology plus good
commercial awareness, and Software Engineers
will need a technical degree.
We believe that experience is the best teacher
and so a lot of your growth will come from
getting stuck into live projects. Throughout,
you can rely on getting the training you
need, when you need it. Wherever you join
us, you’ll work with inspiring people who are
passionate about what they do – and you’ll
find their passion is infectious.
