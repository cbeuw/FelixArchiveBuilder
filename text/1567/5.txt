Green Week 2014
S
omewhere between dusty,
exam stressed brain cells
we all have the equation:
Burning Fossil Fuels +
Greenhouse Effect =
Climate Change = BAD (but not my
problem).
At least for many of us the problem
is swept aside by a fuzzy “What
can I do about it anyway?” What
we maybe forget is that when we
leave this prestigious university
and venture into the real world,
many of us will end up in positions
of considerable power. We may be
responsible for choosing how ethics
influence the actions of corporations
and governments. This could mean
combatting the conventional wisdom
that profits and carbon reductions
are conflicting interests, as have done
many key players such as Ikea, Phillips
and Unilever, all of whom presented
the economic benefits of tackling
climate change at last November’s
climate summit in Poland.
But first let’s reflect on what
happens if we stick to “business as
usual”. Already we are seeing rising
temperatures, shifting rain patterns,
unprecedented glacial melting, rising
sea levels and increasingly common
extreme weather leading to floods and
droughts. Experts across the world,
including the Grantham Institute for
Climate Change here at Imperial, are
predicting that things will get worse
and pose a serious threat to human
lives, economic development and
the natural world. Faced with mass
destruction of ecosystems, increased
spread of infectious diseases, water
scarcity and decline in agricultural
production, that future doesn’t look
bright. And of course the poorest
countries will suffer the most, with
fragile economies bearing the costs of
infrastructure destruction.
So to help people, possibly like you,
feeling helpless up against climate
change, we welcome you to Go Green
Week. By highlighting the positives of
what our university is already doing
and introducing some great practical
starting points for you to become
more sustainable in your own life, we
hope that you’ll get engaged with ‘the
problem of our generation’. Tackling
climate change happens on many
levels, and as a community of 17,000
we really can demand that Imperial
behaves sustainably, whether through
taking investment out of fossil fuel
companies or reducing energy and
food waste (look out for coffee cups!)
Climate change doesn’t have to be
all doom and gloom, and there are
lots of people and organisations doing
proactive things all over the world with
amazing positive consequences. The
age old myth that being sustainable
means reducing your quality of life
is simply not true! Many aspects of
‘being green’ will save you money,
keep you fit and open you up to new
experiences.
For example, we have heard in the
news that energy prices are at their
highest in this decade. Domestic
electricity prices, including VAT, rose
by 7.8% in current terms between Q4
2012 and Q4 2013. Although most
power companies have decided to
freeze their bills this year, TfL didn’t.
By walking or cycling into College,
you save on travelcards, and that’s
at least £800 to spend on something
else. Bringing your own bag for
your supermarket shop may also
earn you “green” points in certain
supermarkets; as they say, every little
helps.
What the College already does
Despite scoring a third class degree in
the People and Planet Green League,
the College actually does a lot in terms
of cutting down our emissions. All
new buildings are fitted with more
environmentally friendly LED lighting
and air filtering systems, while others
are being refurbished to the same high
standard. Only 13% of all college waste
was sent to landfill in 2011-12, with
the rest reused, recycled, recovered
and incinerated.
The on-site composter contributes
to this figure by processing around 2
tonnes of food waste collected from
TasteImperial outlets each week. The
combined heat and power plant (CHP)
located at the basement of Electrical
and Electronic Engineering produced
28,000MW of electricity and 25% of
heating at South Kensington during
2011/12, and energy produced in this
way has an efficiency of up to 90%,
compared to 40% from conventional
power plants.
Despite this, the carbon emissions
at College remain at a high level and
the related taxes stood at around
£900,000 in 2011/12. This sizeable
amount could be put to better use if
our emissions weren’t so high.
Easy ways to be more green
There are many ways to help Imperial
to be environmentally friendly and
many of these are habits that don’t
take much to change. As a starter,
bring a reusable mug for your next
cup of coffee and fill your reusable
water bottles with tap water. Bottled
water is costly for both your wallet
and the environment; just think
about the amount of transportation
and packaging involved! Also, BYOB.
By which we mean bags. Don’t take
plastic bags from supermarkets, the
union shop, JCR, or anywhere else. If
you are planning on a big shop, invest
in a pretty reusable bag and bring it
with you all the time!
While at uni, report any defects
to Facilities Management. Just
drop an email to fm.csc@imperial.
ac.uk if you spot a leaking tap or
your lecture theatre is getting too
warm. The likelihood is nobody has
reported a defect or problem yet
and it’s something that can easily be
fixed. If you are leaving experiments
to run, don’t forget to close the fume
cupboard sashes. There are over 700
of them on campus and studies show
that each fume cupboard produces
up to 9 tonnes of CO2
a year because
air is constantly extracted from them.
By using them properly (i.e. not as
storage boxes) and closing the sashes,
you could save at least 10% of those
emissions.
We easily forget the amount of water
and energy that goes into making the
meat we consume. Why not try eating
meat for one day less a week? Not
only is a less meat-intensive diet often
cheaper and more sustainable, but
you’ll be less at risk to some cancers
and heart disease. Additionally,
whenever you’re about to enjoy a cup
of tea or coffee (or both!), remember
to only boil the amount of water you
need. Not only it would take less time
to make your cuppa, you can also save
energy by only boiling the water you
will use.
Why Green Week?
This year is the first Green Week at
Imperial since 2011. Although some
people doubt the effectiveness of a
Green Week, we feel like it is a good
opportunity to keep sustainability on
everyone’s radar, especially as a way
of learning more about our actions
without the hard selling, like we have
been before. Hence, Imperial Hub has
decided to join another 80 education
institutions in the UK for the “Go
Green Week”, a national initiative to
encourage students to contribute to
this issue.
It will be a chance for you to learn
more about different campaigns that
are going on and eco-friendly facilities
around College, but also voice your
opinions about what should be done
to help College, and us, to be as
“green” as possible.
So what’s happening?
Tuesday 11th, lunchtime: Bike
Workshop with Bike Users Group at
Faculty Building Bike Store. Learn
more about your bike and how to
maintain it!
Wednesday 12th, 17:30: Beekeeping
lecture with Environmental Society at
Union Meeting Room 1. Learn about
the bees at Imperial’s secret garden.
Thursday13th, lunchtime: Composter
tours on campus. Come and have a
look how some of the food waste we
generate every day!
Imperial Co-operative from 4-6pm in
the Sherfield Foyer. Buy organic and
fairtrade food at bargain prices!
On 20th February, Imperial Hub will
be running its bi-weekly Series as a
follow up session of the Green Week.
We shall discuss where we can take
the good work of the week further,
while watching a documentary about
fracking. This highly controversial
topic not only involves our future
with regards to carbon emission, but
also energy security and affordability
in the UK. Do come along if you want
to learn what all the fuss is about and
voice your opinion!
More events are coming soon! Just
head to http://www.imperialhub.org/
green-week to register and reserve
your place or just turn up on the day!
We also have a petition covering
different areas, from sustainable
sourcing to decreasing the number of
plastic bags given at Imperial. Find it
on the website or sign it at our events!
Do you have a great idea or have you
seen anything that College could do
better? Tweet, Facebook or Instagram
these with the hashtag #ICGreenWeek
for a chance to win a £5 IC Co-op
voucher!
Also, why not become a StepChange
ambassador and take action on
College’s carbon footprint! Find
