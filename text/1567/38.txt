Liverpool v Arsenal
(BT Sport 1, Saturday 12:45pm)
Brendan Rodgers will have been dis-
appointed to drop points to West
Brom and Aston Villa recently and
it is only because sides below have
slipped up that the Reds are still in
the driving seat for fourth place. The
Gunners show no signs of relinquish-
ing their clutch on top spot, although
they have a horrible spell of fixtures
to contend with now and you wonder
if Arsene Wenger has the strength in
depth to cope. The pressure will be
well and truly on both sides to win this
and because of that I expect a cagey
game. However, Arsenal tend to fall
short against direct rivals and, since
the Reds were stunning versus Ever-
ton last time out at Anfield, I will tip
them to edge it
1-0
Tottenham v Everton
(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 1:30pm)
Tim Sherwood’s honeymoon period
seems to be over at White Hart Lane.
That spark his players had in his first 5
matches was missing against Man City
and Hull, and this game will be a real
test of his man management skills,
especially with hopes hinging largely
on the exploits of the notoriously er-
ratic Emmanuel Adebayor. Similarly,
Roberto Martinez was given a reality
check about the Toffees’ top four cre-
dentials in the recent Merseyside der-
by. Even though they are above Spurs
in the table, Everton would surely take
a point at kick off and I think that’s ex-
actly what they’ll get.
1-1
Swansea v Cardiff
(Sky Sports 1, Saturday 5:30pm)
This will be a Welsh derby with a dif-
ference – neither the Bluebirds nor
the Swans can be at all sure of Pre-
mier League survival this season and
Michael Laudrup’s men will be hun-
gry for revenge after an embarrassing
defeat at Cardiff in the reverse fixture.
They have been playing better than re-
sults suggest and finally won at home
to Fulham last Wednesday, but then
flattered to deceive as they slumped
to defeat at West Ham. Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer will be buoyed by claiming
his first home win against Norwich,
but Cardiff’s away record is poor and
Swansea’s class should ultimately pre-
vail.
2-0
Man United v Fulham
(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 4pm)
Teams are coming to Old Trafford
with belief, and coupled with recent
injuries I’m sure that’s why we are see-
ing United struggle. But this is a real
gimme for David Moyes – the hapless
Cottagers will be easy pickings for van
Persie and Rooney.
3-0
Aston Villa v West Ham
Last weekend’s victory over Swansea
was bittersweet for Sam Allardyce;
star striker Andy Carroll’s red card
again leaves the Hammers short up
front. Villa halted their home hoodoo
versus West Brom and with Christian
Benteke back on song they ought to
have enough.
2-1
Chelsea v Newcastle
Jose Mourinho again demonstrated
his managerial prowess at Manches-
ter City on Monday and the Blues
certainly look to have the bit between
their teeth now. As last weekend’s
Tyne-Wear derby showed, the Mag-
pies have precious little to play for.
2-0
Crystal Palace v West Brom
Tony Pulis has an outstanding re-
cord since joining the Eagles and here
comes another distinctly winnable
game at Selhurst Park. Pepe Mel be-
came one of few managers to taste
defeat at Villa Park this season and
Palace have the incentive of rising as
high as 11th.
1-0
Norwich v Man City
I worry for Man City. For all their at-
tacking nous, they remain far too vul-
nerable at the back. Fortunately, the
Canaries’ frontline is unlikely to cause
too many problems for them; this is
a nice game for them to regain some
confidence after Monday’s home de-
feat.
1-4
Southampton v Stoke
Mauricio Pochettino’s Saints seem to
have got over their December blip,
with Adam Lallana in particular fir-
ing on all cylinders. Stoke caused Man
United major problems last weekend
but their buccaneering play seldom
pays off on the road.
2-0
Sunderland v Hull
At last the Black Cats are getting the
results they deserve – intriguingly,
they have great form away and for
that reason I cannot see them being
relegated. But the Tigers halted their
run of defeats last weekend and Steve
Bruce will be up for this on his return
to Wearside.
1-1
James White gives his midweek predictions
S
aturday 25th January:
the magic of the FA Cup
filled the air, anticipation
of a big upset was on the
cards at the Etihad but
most importantly 14 of IC’s most
coveted Airborne Rangers did battle
with St Georges 1s. Many of you are
probably wondering what the hell
went down that fateful day - Imperial
1s vs St Georges 1s in LUSL, an 11-
goal thriller and the most orgasmic of
showers to follow.
Arriving early and keen, IC were
out basking in the glorious sun with
their pre match routine that Captain
Robinson seems to keep making
longer and longer (it’s not the only
thing he can make longer, ladies).
The blood was pumping to all the
right places, and our opposition were
barely able to put their kit on. Their
preparation had been diabolical and it
was about to show.
Four and a half minutes of foreplay
before we conducted the all-important
penetration; Captain Robinson played
an exquisitely lofted ball across the
field to Dale who took it down and
fired his load at goal, it hit the bar but
he followed through and took it on
his forehead. The party was only just
getting started as Gregory played a
through ball to Murphy who held off
his defender, despite calls of “your
muscles are embarrassingly small”
from the direction of Teddington, and
then skilfully dinked the ball over the
keeper. We took a blow in the back
door, which was unusually painful as
we are not normally on the receiving
end of such actions. We knew that
every attack had the possibility of a
goal, and from the restart we made
sure we got straight to work; it paid off
when their keeper was stranded in no-
mans land outside of his box, allowing
Gregory to chip the ball over him. 3-1
up and the flood gates were well and
truly open, Dale went on a mazing
run penetrating deeper and deeper
in to the opposition half until he shot
a thunderous effort at the crossbar
which cannoned down on to the goal
line. Calls for Hawkeye technology
to be implemented at Harlington
dominated the post-match conference
but LUSL were not on hand to give a
definitive statement.
We weren’t done in the first half
and we had plenty left in the sack,
Captain Robinson broke in to the box
and pondered on the ball for a little
too long. Vicious rumours circulating
West London suggest he had been
conducting numerous tours the night
before, leaving him a little jaded. His
instinct and close control allowed him
to draw in a foul for which we were
awarded a penalty; it was dispatched in
to the bottom corner of the goal, well
out of the reach of the goalkeeper. The
next goal went to St George’s, a huge
clearance from the half way line that
bounced and the wind carried it over
Casas. Did he mean it? Certainly not;
he does not possess the mathematical
ability to judge the trajectory, let
alone the wind effects. Casas was
hopelessly flailing at it; perhaps his
fine L’Oreal mop of hair got into his
eyes. No worries though, he had no
such problem with those Spanish girls
at the union. Again we rebounded
quicker than Captain Robinson after
realising he had a gap in the market,
with Gregory slotting home from the
left. 5-2 at half time and we were in
the driving seat.
The second half got off in a similar
fashion to the first, minimal foreplay
and a whole lot of action in all the
right areas; Dale opened the scoring
with a brilliant strike from the right.
After being as useless as a virgin
in bed, St Georges changed their
hopeless striker to their BBU who
wore a Vassell shirt; he was going to
have to add this day to his ongoing
list of miserable defeats. Despite his
size the BBU went down quicker than
a horny lesbian; his dive was poorly
executed, with a lack of imagination
and disgracefully poor entry in to the
pool scored him an abysmal 3.5. IC
1s’ thoughts were clearly elsewhere, as
poor man-marking off a free kick led
to a third St George’s goal. That was as
much they were going to get though;
the biggest money shots were about to
come.
The first came from a Nugent tackle
on the edge of the box, storming up
the pitch quicker than a dog on heat
chasing a mate, slipping Gregory in
who finished only needing a single
touch. The fitness of IC was starting
to show. Prestinoni won the ball in
our third releasing Murphy who sped
up the pitch along the right with
Prestinoni and Nugent ready for the
Tesco Value goal. He almost ruined it
but his quick feet allowed him to round
one more player before squaring it to
Prestinoni, who finished neatly in the
bottom left hand corner. That rounded
off all 8 money shots, a drenched St
Georges team sulked off the pitch
covered in shame. Job complete, an
Airborne Ranger never leaves anyone
feeling dissatisfied.
