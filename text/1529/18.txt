Gods of Rain and Presidents of Men
Sandy has ravaged the Eastern coast of America, caused $20billion worth of damage and left millions of Americans
without power. Alexander Soloviev discusses its impact on the presidential campaigns and next Tuesday’s vote.
other nature and the
election campaigns
seem to be syncing
up: hurricane Sandy
makes landfall just as the last week
of campaigning is underway. But just
what does this superstorm mean for
the presidential hopefuls?
It’s important to start oﬀ saying
that Sandy is not your run-of-the-
mill hurricane. It’s like a Michael Bay
movie: total and utter mayhem with
a good clean-up budget. A hurricane
from the south meets a winter storm
UK GDP figures: a turn for the better?
Last week, the Oﬃce for National
Statistics released their ﬁrst estimate
for the economic growth of the UK
economy in the months of July, August
and September, known as the third
quarter. Somewhat unexpectedly, a
1% rise in the GDP of the country was
announced. Given the excuses given
by the Chancellor, George Osborne,
for previous falls ranging from the
weather to the royal wedding, using
the Olympics as a reason for growth
does not seem so far fetched.
All of the Olympic and Paralympic
ticket sales were counted in this
quarter’s economic output, and the
ONS predict that approximately 0.2%
of the growth is solely down to ticket
sales, with the boost to employment
and creative industries harder to
estimate. Of course these ﬁgures are
only an estimate, and as we have seen
in previous quarters, they can be
revised down.
A 1% rise on its own in the UK’s
current economic situation is a good
thing, and suggests that we have left
the second dip of recession. It is also
the largest growth seen in one quarter
from the west (a la Gone with the
Wind), but a polar system from the
north is added to the fray. And a full
moon, for those extra high tides, as
well!
Minus the werewolves and the
superstitious business of it being
Halloween and all, Sandy still seems
set to be a record killer and coster.
Enter election.
As circumstantial as it seems,
Sandy will make some diﬀerence to
the election. For starters, it is largely
eﬀecting the northeast of the good old
US of A. Making landfall in New Jersey,
the storm is expected to spread to the
north, ﬁlling up the periphery with
several feet of snow and centimeters
of showers. That being said, it’s
important to note that the northeast
votes predominately Democrat. So will
Obama stand to lose some support?
Short answer, no. Though there
might be lower turnout at the polls,
as one could expect in weather as
apocalyptic as Sandy, Obama still
touts at least a ten-point lead in most
northeastern states.
Also, as the incumbent, Obama
stands to proﬁt from this hellish storm
system. That is, if he plays his cards
since the ﬁnancial crisis began in
2007. George Osborne is of course
delighted that the economy seems
to be responding to his budgetary
measures, but Labour spokespeople
are wary of this analysis, given that the
package of tax increases and spending
cuts (worth about 4% of GDP) are only
coming into eﬀect in January 2013,
and that many of the reasons given for
this quarter’s growth are temporary.
In other G8 countries such as
Germany and France, growth in the
2nd quarter of 2012 was slow or non-
existent, 0.3% and 0.0% respectively,
compared with -0.7% in the UK for
the same period. The predicted rise
of 1.0% in the UK GDP in the third
quarter is an even more surprising
result because of this, and the French
predictions of a contraction of 0.9% in
their GDP for this quarter. All of these
ﬁgures mean that the EU predicts the
27 member states will see overall no
change in the GDP of the region across
2012, whereas the UK alone would see
a 0.5% rise. Given our unemployment
ﬁgures and our continued decline
in manufacturing and construction
sectors, it is hard to see how this
position can be maintained for the UK
economy compared to manufacturing
giants, such as Germany.
Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, has
suggested that this growth is fragile,
and the government must remain
wary of threats to its stability, such as
Greece bailing out of the Eurozone, or
the eﬀects of hurricane Sandy hitting
the Caribbean and the East Coast of
the USA on the global economy. The
Conservatives are also cautiously
optimistic about the UK’s chances of
staying out of recession and falling
into a triple dip recession for the ﬁrst
time in UK economic history.
With growth in the economy and
jobless rates tentatively down in
the last quarter (although this does
include part-time and temporary
work), signs are that the UK is slowly
on the mend, but with more public
spending cuts on the horizon, will
the recovery continue? Christine
Lagarde, Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund, has
called for austerity measures to be
slowed down, else risking economic
growth. The IMF has changed the way
they estimate the eﬀects of austerity
measures away from the method
used by the British Treasury, so that
a contraction of approximately 0.9%
to 1.7% will be felt across Europe if
austerity measures continue.
Whilst these ﬁgures are only
estimates, and no one knows who has
the correct interpretation, each party
will argue that they have the correct
plan. Our fragile economy is in their
hands.

disaster could give him an extra boost.
Cool brow, yet warm and comfortable
rhetoric, Obama could make himself
seem as the modest savior/rebuilder of
the northeast.
This resonates much wider than just
this region. One only needs to think
of 2005, when hurricane Katrina ran
amok not only on the levees of New
Orleans, bringing on ﬂooding not
seen since Noah, but also on Bush’s
popularity ratings. His perceived

shouldn’t and, if he wants to win the
election, can’t let this brewing crisis go

is not helping himself out. While the

A visual metaphor for
Mitt Romney’s campaign
means to ﬁx the mess that Sandy has
left behind. This doesn’t bode well
for his chances in the northeast and
diminishes his chances in the bad-
weather magnets in the south.
Romney has cancelled events out of
respect for those in the storm’s path
and tried to inﬂuence his supporters
to donate to the relief eﬀort. That
is worth note. But lacking Obama’s
control of the situation, there is really
little else Romney can do.
It seems like Sandy and Obama are a
match made in heaven.
