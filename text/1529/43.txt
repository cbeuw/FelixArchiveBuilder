This week you wear a YMC-
MB snapback to lectures.
Unfortunately as you are nei-
ther black or “trendy Asian”
you just look like a complete
twat. You go home and write
about how no one under-
stands you on Tumblr. Give
up on being cool and em-
brace the fact you’re a nerd,
fresher.
This week a friend admits to
you that he once had sex on
the steps of the Royal Albert
Hall because he and his gal
could see from the street that
his room-mate was in. In an
attempt to do one better, you
have sex with 90s pop sensa-
tion “Steps” in the Royal Albert
Hall. It’s awesome up until the
point H jizzes in your eye.
This week the glow of Fresh-
ers’ Week has worn off and
you finally come to terms
with the fact that you made
a mistake coming to Imperial
and that you should cut your
losses and just leave. Unfor-
tunately for you, you’re a sec-
ond year PhD student who’s
been here for 6 years. Better
late than never.
This week you get a job with
Taste Imperial to help them
improve their range of sand-
wiches beyond their current
repertoire of chewy bread and
chicken in differing ratios. You
come up with a mayonnaise,
chicken and bacon sandwich
and call it The Hollandaise
Club. Commercial Services
shuts you down.
This week the Felix Editor tells
you to stop writing self-refer-
ential, fourth-wall-breaking,
macabre horoscopes suffused
with surrealist imagery related
to angry emotional scars. You
spawn wings of a bat and the
feathers of a raven and feast on
the body of your ex-girlfriend
and mother, screaming “WHY
DIDN’T YOU LOVE ME?”
This week you decide to see
what life is like on the other side
and visit the Pleasure Lounge
at UCL. There are girls every-
where, and the football team
are chanting a song you’re
not used to. You panic and
flee back to 568. It takes you
3 hours to get served, creepy
PhDs hit on you and the music
is shit. It’s good to be home.
This week you go to careers
fair. You fake interest in as
many companies as you can
and walk away with 6 mugs,
4000 pencils, a yo-yo and a
Frisbee. Unfortunately you
don’t succeed in getting a
job. You go home, burn the
pencils for warmth and eat
Frisbee soup out of a Unile-
ver mug.
This week you read an arti-
cle in Felix about the Union’s
proposed constitutional
change. Unfortunately these
doesn’t include anything
about when they’re going to
stop the bars from being shit
and overpriced. You give up
on union politics for the rest
of your time here. Good de-
cision.
This week you’re sat at your
desk doing an assessed
problem sheet when you re-
alised that you only have at
most another 60 years left
on the face of this earth and
that you should do some-
thing interesting. 3 hours
later you’ve scrolled through
Reddit and installed Win-
dows 8. Both suck.
This week you go to a Bon-
fire night party. You realise
that it’s a massive “we hate
catholics party,” celebrating
a failed terrorist attack. In an
attempt to capture the ethnic
hatred/celebrate failed ter-
rosim vibe and make it 21st
century, you start “we hate
Abu Hamza day.” It doesn’t
catch on.
This week you start mo-
vember. Unfortunately your
complete lack of testoster-
one and pale, blonde hair
means that after 3 weeks of
trying all you can manage is
a slightly dirty top tip. You
steal elephant hormones
from a biochem lab and rub
them on your top lip. You get
cancer. Unlucky.
This week you go and watch
Skyfall. You feel a strange
yearning in your loins ev-
ery time Judi Dench is on
screen, which is replaced
by an overwhelming sense
of guilt and a realisation that
you haven’t phoned nan in
months. You go home and
have a misery wank over a
retirement home prospectus.
