The Biodiversity Crisis
Philippa Skett talks about why we need to act, fast

the planet passing between the star
and the detector. However, doing this
requires wading through vast quanti-
ties of data, and can take thousands
and thousands of hours. Computer al-
gorithms can help, but in many cases
the human eye is better at spotting the
tell-tale signs of a planet.
To speed up this process, Planet
Hunters was set up in 2010, and now
has over 170,000 registered users who
look at data collected over the course

mperial saw the advent of
OneZoomTM
this month, a
navigable, online Tree of Life
that allows for easy explora-
tion of mammals and how
they are related to each other geneti-
cally. Using a click of a mouse, you
can scroll through millions of years of
evolutionary hardship to come to the
organisms it has shaped today, each
settled cosily on a little leaf.
Created by Life Sciences’ own Dr
James Rosindell, it comes in a patch-
work of colours, not for added aes-
thetics but to highlight just how
at risk some of our mammals
are from extinction. Ranging
from a healthy green to a mor-
bid red, each
mammal’s
leaf is col-
oured depending on how at risk it is
using the IUCN Red List of hreat-
ened Species. he tree appears almost
as a patchwork quilt of red and green,
with the IUCN currently listing 25%
of mammals being at risk, alongside
41% of amphibians, 33% of reef build-
ing corals, 13% of birds, and 30% of
conifers.
Furthermore, it is estimated that
around 50% of the total current spe-
cies present now will be extinct in
the next 50 years. he
cascading eﬀects of
species loss it may induce could lead
to an even greater extinction rate than
could be possibly predicted. Some re-
searchers are estimating that the pre-
sent extinction rate is up to 100 times
greater than the natural extinction
rate that occurs due to progression
of mutations and general evolution
alone.
“he Biodiversity Crisis” is the hot
name for this 6th major extinction
that we are currently riding out – the
other ﬁve being down to either ex-
treme climate or biochemical shifts;
this one is being blamed on just one
species and its actions: the Homo
Sapiens. As we push climate
change, deforestation, exploita-
tion of ﬁsheries, and intensive
agriculture to their limits,
it is the upsetting of
the ecosystems that
is claiming the cas-
ualties – around 3
species of a plant
or animal are dis-
appearing per hour.
But just what
implications such
a reduction could
have on popula-
tions and liveli-
hoods, mainly in less
economically developed
countries, are diﬃcult to
determine. Over-exploita-
tion is causing these massive biodi-
versity reductions in tandem with the
population booms these countries are
experiencing.
hat is not to say they are at fault;
it is easy to see how a father of ﬁve
would go about ﬁshing enough to feed
his family without considering ab-
stract biodiversity limitations, but in
some coastal communities up to 90%
of the individuals are doing exactly the
same. With 1 in 4 ﬁsheries worldwide
now depleted in biomass to a point
where they are below a sustainable
level, such exploitation is going to be
devastating in the long run when the
ﬁsheries run dry and communities
lose their greatest commodity.
In many of these scenarios, it is the
lack of education and resources at
such hot spots that make it diﬃcult
to implement sustainable resource
acquisition, which would provide long
term beneﬁts for both them and us. So
how does that bring us into the pic-
ture? If you are not currently sitting in
SAF, then no doubt conservation and
resource management are not going
to be on your mind, but there are still
things you can do to help the bigger
picture.

An iconic image from Star Wars: Epi-
sode IV is the double sunset on Luke
Skywalker’s home planet Tatooine,
which orbits a binary star. Not bad,
but how about a quadruple sunset?
A recently discovered planet, PH1,
orbits a binary star which is itself
orbited by another binary star, the
ﬁrst example of this sort of system.
he planet’s name is short for ‘Planet
Hunters 1’ and is named after a citi-
zen-science project based at Yale Uni-
versity, which was responsible for the
discovery.
Planet Hunters was set up to help
researchers get through the moun-
tains of data being produced by NA-
SA’s Kepler spacecraft. he most com-
mon method of discovering planets
is to look for dips in the amount of
light detected from a star caused by
of a month to identify whether or not
a planet may be present. Kian Jek and
Robert Gagliano did exactly that. Sev-
eral other candidate planets have been
discovered by the project, but PH1
is the ﬁrst to meet the strict criteria
needed to be oﬃcially classed as a
planet.
PH1 has a radius of approximately
6 times that of Earth and circles the
closest pair of stars every 137 days.
he other pair of stars lies approxi-
mately 90 billion miles from PH1.
Citizen science approaches have
been widely used over recent years,
such as in the protein-folding game
Foldit, in which players attempt to
fold protein sequences to identify the
best possible structure. While compu-
tational power is increasing, in many
cases the human touch is still needed,
and these crowd-sourcing approaches
are able to use people on a large-scale
to power discovery.
The view from PH1, including its four suns

Or simply put more of those energy-
saving tactics that were driven into
us since primary school into action.
With climate change driving biodiver-
sity loss too, cutting down on such ef-
fects can only beneﬁt the birds and the
bees. Strive to use renewable energy,
walk instead of drive places or simply
turn the lights oﬀ when you leave the
room.
Still not convinced? Although it can
be diﬃcult to sympathise with a tiny
little mushroom on the edge of disap-
pearing, consider the bigger biodiver-
sity blanket as a whole. Biodiversity
as a network of individuals is what
makes an ecosystem; it is the lattice of
interactions between the species that
drives habitat construction, mainte-
nance and regrowth. Remove a thread
from the weave and it all begins to un-
ravel, which is now accelerating right
before our eyes.
Biodiversity contributes to fertility
and crop health, medical availability
from plants, air quality, material qual-
ity and a general high quality of life.
As the species drop out, one by one,
the buﬀer biodiversity is providing us
is reducing bit by bit. So if you don’t
really see the point of saving that
mushroom, do it to save us; as long
as you don’t admit to doing it for self-
ish purposes, no one will ever need to
know.
