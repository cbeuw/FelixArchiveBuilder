Butterflies
Cleggmanxxx
Not this again. Ever since read-
ing that book on chaos theory you
blame them for everything.
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
I caught one taking a piss on my
toast. Fuck butterflies. Fuck them in
their buttery asses.

Hangman Career’s Fair Awards
his Wednesday saw the inevitable
return of Imperial’s largest Career’s
Fair, and while most students use this
as a valuable opportunity to learn how
best to ‘envision a career trajectory
in the Consultant-Technology-of-Fi-
nance sector’, there is always a small
minority who think it’s big and clever
to collect as many freebees as possible
and then rank the associated compa-
nies in accordance with the quality of
their free crap. Our intrepid reporter
is one such person. Below he provides
compelling arguments for forgoing a
life in technology for accountancy.
Food. When it’s free, you don’t care
what it tastes like. And that helps be-
cause branded mints taste like shit.
Oﬀerings from Metaswitch Networks
and Deutsche Bank yield the same
confusion of texture (am I a chewy
minty or a brittle,
crumbly mint?)
which tells us
these are compa-
nies don’t know
who the want to
hire, and have no
concise market
strategy. EMC2 ‘s
mints, on the other
hand, are shit tic-
tacs. Read into that
what you will. So it
falls to Unilever to
take the Hangman
Prize for Best Free
Food 2012 with their
oﬀering of a sweet and
spicy Pot Noodle. hese
guys might not be gourmet, but you
know what you’re getting
yourselves in for when you
apply for their intern-
ships. he New York
Stock Exchange earn
a mention with their
branded tubes of
Smarties.
From food to lit-
erature, and with
careers fairs come the
customary 200 rain-for-
ests worth of brochures you
have to lug about before you’re
deemed qualiﬁed but the Imperial
College careers service to win a cel-
ebration chocolate (but don’t get your
hopes up, the Maltesers were
g o n e
hours
a g o ) .
That’s
w h y
t h i s
year’s
Hang-
m a n
P r i z e
for Ca-
r e e r
Fair Lit-
erature
g o e s
to Red
Gate for their charm-
ing ‘he Book of
Red Gate’ which
features a UI art gal-
lery of their software
products guarded
by a surly security
guard and a Code
of the Year inter-
nal competition,
the winner cho-
sen on the grounds
that it’s ‘it has lots of
complicated-looking
shit in it’. hese are guys
you want to work for.
he miscellaneous cat-
egory comprises runners up
for the grand prize that missed
out on the top three but
nevertheless de-
serve a mention.
International
Financial of-
fered the most
arrogance in-
ducing foam
thingy of the
day with a
squidgey planet
earth to make you
feel like, gee with
an Imperial degree un-
der your belt
you can rule the
world! Bloomberg
chose to
panda to the
nerd in all of
use with a Ru-
bik’s Cube that,
coming from a seasoned 3x3
speed solver, is harder than
your average, no thanks to
company branding. hese
guys make your job more
diﬃcult than it needs to
be. Consultancy ﬁrm Tow-
ers Watson (never heard
of them either...) supplied
me with a sturdy metal red
water bottle complete with
caribena as if indicating their
internship ‘Bootcamp’ doesn’t stray
too far from the term’s origins. IMC
(they’re something to do with ﬁnance,
I wasn’t listening that much) gave me
a whole T-shirt. Col-
our blue; size large
(I’m a medium.
Not impressed)
but once you get
over the fact you
just got a whole
garment for
free, you real-
ise you’re never
going to actually
wear it.
So to the top three. In third is
Deutsche Bank’s oﬀering of a Breo
style sports watch. Water resistant
and a trendy blue with minimal
branding, these guys oﬀer gradu-
ates careers in being sleek and sexy
and most sought after. Second place
goes to HSBC with the incredible of-
fering of a fully functional USB mouse.
he scroll is a little slow but it comes
with a handy pouch and detachable,
extendable USB cord. Works as soon
as you plug it in. Bloody faultless.
Ladies and gentlemen, pray silence
please. Our winner, and Hangman’s
choice for Top Graduate Employer
2012 is... De-
loitte. Why I
hear you
a s k ?
What
could
t h e y
possibly give
a student to trump a USB mouse?
he answer: in ear headphones. And
they aren’t shit! his entire review was
written listening to every genre of mu-
sic I could think of through Deloitte
branded in-ear headphones and they
are sensational. Provided in a handy
‘no tangling of your cord’ case and
three choices of rubber ear inserts, I’d
pay at least £10 for a set of these. he
moral of the story: if you work for De-
loitte, you become a magnet for cool
shit.
Austerity Career’s
Fair 2012: not too
well attended
