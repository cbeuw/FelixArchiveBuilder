Animal testing has always been a
very controversial topic amongst
people. A lot of research is conduct-
ed at Imperial and sometimes this
may involve the use of animals. he
currently policy on the Use of Ani-
mals in Research states that “animals
may only be used in research pro-
grammes where their use is shown
to be essential”. his means that ev-
ery possible method that does not
use animals is considered and only if
there are no other options, animals
will be used. Even when animals
are used, this is kept to the smallest
number of purpose-bred animals.
Work involving animals can only
start once Imperial College’s Ethical
Review Process and the Home Oﬃce
has approved it. he policy adds that
“animals will never be used for trivial
purposes and their health and well-
being are given the highest priority”.
Minimizing the numbers of ani-
mals used in experiments is an
achievement that can be commend-
ed from the National Centre for the
Placement, Reﬁnement and Reduc-
tion of Animals in Research (NC3Rs).
Researchers that make an eﬀort to
reduce the number of animals used
can win this award and PhD students
from Imperial College have won this
prize in previous years.
In the Government commissioned
Ipsos Mori poll, it was revealed that
there was a ten-percentage point
decrease in public support for sci-
entiﬁc research involving animals
since 2010. Results showed that only
66 percent of people agreed with
the statement ‘I can accept animal
experimentation as long as it is for
medical research purposes’ com-
pared to the 76 percent in 2010.
his signiﬁcant decrease has stirred
a declaration to be formed on the
‘openness of animal research’. In Oc-
tober, Imperial College was proud to
announce that they had signed this
declaration.
Professor Maggie Dallman, Prin-
cipal of the Faculty of Natural Sci-
ences commented saying ‘he re-
sults of the Ipsos Mori poll suggest
that we need greater openness about
why such research is important and
what it involves. I hope that this dec-
laration will give organisations and
individual scientists the conﬁdence
to speak out with the support of the
wider research community.”
