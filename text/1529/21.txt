ello? Is this thing on?
It’s been a while, you
see. In fact, by my
count less than half
of the undergraduates
were around the last time I wrote for
Felix. I’d do a formal introduction
and all, but the concept boils down
to a pretty simple “I vehemently hate
more things before breakfast than
you’ve managed to mildly dislike in
your entire life” schtick. I’ve just been
a little preoccupied lately to write in
Felix. I’ve kept busy, of course, thanks
for asking. I’ve taken to just whisper-
ing swear words to people on the
tube on the commute home. Similar
audience size, but admittedly less
anonymous.
Originally, you see, I used to joke
about hilariously large-scale things,
in an attempt to be so oﬀensive that
people would be cajoled into writing
into the Comment section. My ﬁrst

Angry Geek is back
Hopefully it’ll go better than that time Mike Tyson returned
year writing included pieces which –
and it’s hard to list these sarcastically,
but bear with me – endorsed the
abuse of South American economies,
suggested we take the vote away from
women and recommended demol-
ishing the entire of the College as a
statement about Green Week. You’d
be surprised how few people wrote
in. At one point I oﬀered ﬁfty quid
of my own money and even that only
convinced a half-dozen people to pen
a comment piece.
As with all gimmicks, though, even-
tually they take on a life of their own,
and before I knew it I was writing
about real things that were going on at
Imperial, real irritations and obscene
regularities of Imperial life. hings
like an increasingly smug attitude to-
wards the poor being demonstrated
by a worrying number of students.
hings like the scary, dystopian ob-
session with some of the world’s best
science and engineering graduates be-
ing funnelled into whoever oﬀered the
biggest pay packet. hings like a tacit
acceptance of sexism and xenophobia
that permeates many of the student
subcultures here.
hese things still hang in the air at
Imperial years later, like particularly
adhesive farts from the arse of a big-
oted and unlikeable dung beetle. It’s
not that I somehow ﬁgured I had so
much inﬂuence that merely by men-
tioning them the Rector would take
action against them. hey’d been go-
ing on for many years before I arrived
here, and they’ll continue many years
after I’ve left. It’s more that I see just as
few people seem to care about them as
they did six years ago when I started
writing this column for the ﬁrst time.
hat matters.
I don’t know if I’ll be able to pop in
much this year, but I’d like to. In case
I don’t, let me try a diﬀerent tack this
time in getting people to debate and
talk in this great section of Felix: Im-
perial needs people to speak up and
talk about its problems. It needs peo-
ple who are unhappy about the way
one of the greatest universities in the
world conducts itself to stand up and
make their opinion clear. Every single
person reading Felix is an adult, a citi-
zen of voting age who can go and get a
mortgage, get married and go and die
in the army tomorrow should they so
wish. his is not an institution run by
grown-up men and women who know
better than you: you are paying to be
educated and the way this university
operates every day reﬂects on you.
here is no better place to make your
views clearer than Felix, so write in
now and speak your mind.
hough obviously, if you’re wrong
I’ll write in swiftly the week after and
bite your fucking head oﬀ.
It’s good to be back.
means that I am dumb and shallow. I am
not either of those things, but I do process
information more slowly than the rest of
you. In fact it has taken me all day to ﬁg-
ure out how to respond to your use of the
R-word last night.
I thought ﬁrst of asking whether you
meant to describe the President as some-
one who was bullied as a child by people
like you, but rose above it to ﬁnd a way to
succeed in life as many of my fellow Spe-
cial Olympians have.
hen I wondered if you meant to de-
scribe him as someone who has to struggle
to be thoughtful about everything he says,
as everyone else races from one snarkey
sound bite to the next.
Finally, I wondered if you meant to
degrade him as someone who is likely to
receive bad health care, live in low grade
housing with very little income and still
manages to see life as a wonderful gift.
Because,Ms.Coulter,thatiswhoweare
– and much, much more.
AfterIsawyourtweet,Irealizedyoujust
wanted to belittle the President by linking
him to people like me. You assumed that
people would understand and accept that
being linked to someone like me is an in-
sult and you assumed you could get away
with it and still appear on TV.
I have to wonder if you considered other
hateful words but recoiled from the back-
lash.
Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society,
need to learn that being compared to peo-
ple like me should be considered a badge
of honor.

still loves life so much.
Come join us someday at Special
Olympics. See if you can walk away with
Imperial College’s Careers Advisory
Service being tarnished by handling
their money disturbs me. I would
suggest all proceeds raised through
providing said services to Glencore
be donated to Save The Children
and that the company is no longer
promoted to students by either the
Union or the College, until such a
time that Glencore stop utilising
child labour, and drop whatever
pitiable excuse they are currently
using to justify it.

Sir,
I’ve been reading the back section of Fe-
lix with great interest since the hang-
man rape joke ﬁasco last year, and
I have to say I’m pretty disappointed
at how little has changed. In the past
week you have used the work “gay” and
“retarded” as an insult several times.
his simply is not acceptable, I really
hope that you can change these things
in time for the issue next week.
his was addressed to Ann Coulter,
but I believe its message applies just as
well to Twatter.
“Dear Ann Coulter,
Come on Ms. Coulter, you aren’t dumb
and you aren’t shallow. So why are you
continually using a word like the R-word
as an insult?
I’m a 30 year old man with Down syn-
drome who has struggled with the public’s
perception that an intellectual disability
Sir,
It undoubtedly came as a great sur-
prise today, upon viewing the latest
James Bond ﬁlm Skyfall, to see that the
Editor-in-Chief of this very publication
is forging an acting career on the side! I
very much enjoyed his performance as
Q. His rapport with Daniel Craig was
one of the ﬁlm’s many highlights. I look
forward to his further thespianism
with great interest!

Sir,
I would be interested to know how
much Glencore is paying to hire a
stall at the Imperial Careers Fair
(Wednesday 31st of October). I
would also be interested in knowing
how much Felix was paid for their
frankly bizarre looking advert on
last week’s back page. I am a man of
few morals and even fewer princi-
ples, but one thing I cannot abide by
is child abuse. Glencore have a well-
documented history of pre-Victorian
style labour practices in countries
where there are no law enforce-
ment agencies to stop them (Google:
“Glencore, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Child Labour” for a spot of
light reading) and the thought of
two noble institutions; Felix and
your heart unchanged.
A friend you haven’t made yet,
John Franklin Stephens, Global Messen-
ger Special Olympics Virginia”
Maybe think twice about publishing
material (even in Hangman, and yes, I
understand that it’s supposed to be of-
fensive) that uses derogatory language
towards people whose lives are already
hard enough as it is.
his applies to using gay as an in-
sult too. I believe that you’re intelligent
enough to be humorous without mak-
ing fun of oppressed minorities. Give it
a go!

Officer), via email
Editor’s Reply:
Hi Lizzie,
I’ve thought for a long time about this,
which is why I’m replying so late.
I apologise for any oﬀence caused.
Hangman is just meant to be funny, not
oﬀensive. All the writers and I want to
do is have a section where anyone can
write something funny; the hope is that
people will laugh and enjoy a welcome
break from seriousness. Humour some-
times toes a line.
Having thought about it, I don’t think
that the use of the word “gay” in Twatter
a while ago was oﬀensive. It was com-
pletely in context and in character for
the politicians in that week to talk to
each other like that. It was used in refer-
ence to an unimaginative way of chang-
ing people’s Facebook status when they
leave themselves logged in.
he word “retard” again was used in
context of the characters. Part of the
whole joke of Twatter is that these seri-
ous people are behaving and acting like
teenagers on the Internet. Much like a
show like he Inbetweeners may use
language like that for dialogue.
Maybe you can say it is normalising
something as an insult to use it, and
therefore enforcing a view that it is a
bad thing. However, I think that the lan-
guage used in Twatter is just reﬂecting
and parodying today’s society.
