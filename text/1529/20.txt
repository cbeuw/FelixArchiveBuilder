y now, you might’ve
heard the news about
the Italian scientists that
were found guilty of fail-
ing to warn the populace
of the earthquake that devastated the
region of Abruzzo three years ago.
he Grandi Rischi (Great Risks) is a
commission of experts on calamities
whose purpose is to monitor the likeli-
hood of such catastrophes happening,
and to advise on how to avoid them
or mitigate their eﬀects; according to
the judges, they failed to predict the
earthquake and therefore are at least
partly responsible for the over 300
deaths, thousands of wounded and
tens of thousands of evacuees.
his sets an extremely dangerous
precedent, and indicates a troubling
attitude towards science. Earthquakes,
as events, are very hard to foretell and
in general almost no scientiﬁc pre-
diction can be made with 100% con-
ﬁdence; to require absolute certainty
in this matter is preposterous. But
science is seen as “those nerds in lab
coats who always know things.” It is
almost as if omniscience is the norm,
and whoever claims to be scientist
must be prepared to be always right
or face the consequences; almost as
if science is a dark art from which to
conjure answers. Who, in the scientif-
ic community, can aﬀord no margin of
error whatsoever? Who can even get
a ﬂawless record in predicting such
matters?
Now, we must be fair. Italy is no
stranger to corruption, and there are
chilling tales and records of phone
calls documenting how the boss of the
Protezione Civile (Civil Protection)
told the committee to downplay the
risk of earthquake to prevent panic in
the population, and that other experts
had predicted the earthquake and
were ignored. However, while this is
a shameful example of science always
coming second to politics, seismolo-
gists from America, Japan and Swit-
zerland have reacted to the news of
the trial by claiming that the data was
contradictory and that, in the same
position, they would’ve also given
similar advice.
Many are now commenting that it
would’ve been better for the scientists
to err on the side of caution and warn
the population anyway; but Italy is a
highly seismic zone: does this mean
that we should be constantly crying
wolf? It has been extensively deter-
mined that, with current methods, it
is impossible to predict with suﬃcient
accuracy the occurrence of an earth-
quake; to treat every possible hint as
an emergency might create alarmism
and cheapen the value of warnings.

High-risk zones should be equipped
to deal with such events, but to de-
mand unerring precision is irrespon-
sible.
he problem is, fundamentally, one
of scientiﬁc education, and the need
to give someone the blame for the
catastrophe. his combination led
the public to perceive that experts
could’ve predicted the earthquake but
didn’t, and hence must be punished
and tried. People of Abruzzo cheered
at the court’s decision, claiming that
justice had been done, when in fact it
was a mockery and a farce: a mockery,
because it grossly misinterprets how
the scientiﬁc process works, and a
farce, because it was little more than a
search for scapegoats.
If the committee actually bowed to
political pressures and reassured that
there was little risk of a calamity with-
out doing a more extensive analysis, it
is troubling and it should be addressed
more fully; but they never discounted
the possibility of an earthquake. Peo-
ple choose to ignore this because it
is easier to see the question as one
of people who didn’t do their job, be-
cause their job isn’t actually under-
stood, and because it is more reassur-
ing, in a perverse way, to think that it
was due to human error rather than a
random and unpredictable whim of
nature.
he adage comes to mind, that any
suﬃciently advanced technology is in-
distinguishable from magic, and that’s
what scientists are seen as: sorcerers
who deal with incomprehensible ar-
cane matters. And like them they are
burnt at the (metaphorical) stake for
things that the public does not under-
stand.
(Yes, it’s that guy from University Challenge!)
n 1615, Galileo was tried and
convicted by the Italian in-
quisition for his unorthodox
views on the heliocentrism of
our solar system. His denial to
comply and bend over before the es-
tablished power threw him into house
arrest until the end of his life. Howev-
er, it also sparked a scientiﬁc revolu-
tion, an attempt to distance knowledge
from established sayings, dogmas and
stories, whilst giving birth to one of
the brightest periods of humanity. For
the ﬁrst time, knowledge and the logi-
cal search for truth were put ahead of
fairy tales and excuses to sit on gold
thrones under marble cupules.
Now, it seems, Italy has decided
that science’s nice and fruitful run has
reached its end, and decided to return
to its old methods of castration of the
intellect and witch hunting.
I understand that the press is prob-
ably not reporting the case in the right
way; that there was probably avoid-
ance and trampling of established
emergency protocols under seismo-
logical alerts; that if the scientists did
not mess up the ‘advice’ they gave on
whether the whole town was going to
disappear oﬀ the face of the Earth or
not, plenty of lives might have been
saved.
However, what amazes me is how
easily authorities can punish a scien-
tist for wrongly predicting something
which is by deﬁnition unpredictable,
yet can let ‘Nobel prize winners’ (I do
not believe in Economics to be Nobel-
worthy) or any big framed, patchy
headed CEO walk away freely after
their wrong ‘predictions’ collapse en-
tire economies and, with them, mil-
lions of lives.
he diﬀerence between these two
is exactly the same one that separates
doctors from holistic reiki touch ther-
apy scumbag con artists or pharma-
ceutical research from watered down
solutions of watered down active
components, so watered down they
don’t exist anymore.
And as long as we don’t get these
straight and this tendency to punish
knowledge (or the attempt to achieve
it) continues, our society, our minds,
will keep on ‘involving’, until we return
to the dark ages where knowledge and
logic were too scared to ﬁght mythol-
ogy and bullshit.
