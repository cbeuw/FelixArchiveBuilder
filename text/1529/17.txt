Apple had another keynote
t last week’s Apple key-
note we all expected just
the launch of the new
iPad mini, but the key-
note proved a surprise as
Apple announced more new products
and upgrades than most had expected.
Introduction
Tim Cook came on stage, and like all
previous keynotes spouted oﬀ facts
andﬁguresthatdescribeApple’samaz-
ing position with its various products.
he iPhone 5 “5 million iPhones sold
in the opening weekend” and “ [the]
fastest selling smartphone”, iOS 6 “200
million devices in spite of “mapgate”
and “scuﬀgate”, iMessage “300 Billion
messages sent” and Game Centre “160
million accounts” were all mentioned,
as well as a few more. hese stats are
quite amazing, however, they have to
be taken with a pinch of salt, as Apple
will not really brag about their not-so-
amazing ﬁgures would they.
iBooks
For all those who read on their iOS
devices, Apple has brought out a new
version of iBooks (which now has
more than 1.5 million books). he new
features include: a scrolling option for
easier reading, better integration with
iCloud directly in the bookshelf, easy-
to-use Twitter and Facebook sharing
as well as supporting new languages
like Korean, Japanese etc. he down-
load of iBooks is free, meaning there
is no reason not to upgrade other than
being lazy.
MacBook
After having put Retina display on the
MacBook Pro 15”, the MacBook Pro
13” now ﬁnally has also gotten the up-
grade to the beautiful display. he 13”
(Macbook Pro) also has other signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerences from the previous ver-
sion, e.g. it has been made 20% thin-
ner as well as almost half a kilogram
lighter. Apple has continued with their
movement into cloud storage and
has also removed the optical
drive on the Macbook Pro
(meaning no CD/DVD’s
for all the retro oldies/
hipsters who still use
them). he 13” (penis
MacBook Pro) has the
same features that the
new 15” has as well,
so you can expect Air-
Play, documents in
the cloud and Power
Nap. Although it is
£500 cheaper than
its bigger brother,
£999 for the cheap-
est model is still quite expensive. he
question is, when price isn’t a crucial
factor, who would want the MacBook
Air with this new Pro out?
Mac mini
he ﬁrst of the two minis mentioned
in this keynote, the Mac mini is Ap-
ple’s budget computer and it has ﬁnally
seen an overdue upgrade. Hardware-
wise, the Mac mini now has ivy bridge
chips, Intel HD graphics, WiFi, three
USB 3 ports as well as a thunderbolt
port. he diﬀerent variations range
from 500GB to 2 TB of HDD memory
and the higher end version can be a
OS X server, which all in all makes this
quite a nice desktop to own.
iMac
After an extremely long time and lots
of moaning by iMac users, Apple ﬁ-
nally updated the ﬂagship of its Mac
range. Incredibly thin (at just 5 mm)
and light (shedding 3.6 kilos com-
pared to the previous model) it’s hard
to believe that such a powerful com-
puter can be encompassed within. he
screen has now been laminated direct-
ly onto the outer glass and it’s 75% less
reﬂective than the previous iteration.
here is also now a HD FaceTime cam-
era, with dual microphones, to make
Skype/FaceTime calls that bit sharper
and clearer. he new iMac also has Ivy
bridge processors up to 32GB RAM as
well as 3TB of HDD memory. Like the
new MacBook Pro though, there is no
optical drive, so once again you are lim-
ited to a SD card Reader,
USB ports and
Thunderbolt.
Something new
that’s quite ex-
citing though
is Apple’s Fu-
sion Drive. As
the name sug-
gests it is a fu-
sion between
Flash
and HDD, allowing for the good per-
formance of ﬂash-based storage with
the storage size of hard disk drives.
iPad (the big one)
Just six months after releasing the
3rd generation iPad, Apple has pretty
much screwed over all their customers
who bought one (or more). his is be-
cause of the release of a brand spank-
ing new iPad, with the new lightning
connector, better processor as well as
better graphics. his has pretty much
made the 3rd generation as obsolete
as the iPhone 4. he price is just the
same as before, so if you didn’t ﬂinch
and buy the iPad (3rd generation)
early, this might be a good buy for
you. For all the rest of you, who are
annoyed at Apple’s uncaring attitude,
tough luck and better luck next time?
iPad mini
he mini pretty much came out as ex-
pected, and we did do a rumour round-
up a two weeks ago (have a read online
if you want), but for all you people who
didn’t read that article, here is a short
summary of what happened. he iPad
mini is a 7.85” tablet that you can hold
in one hand. It is as thin as a pencil and
weighs the same amount as a pad of
paper. One great thing about this re-
lease is that it has the same resolution
as the iPad 2, which means that all apps
that are written for the full-sized iPad
will work perfectly for the iPad mini. It
has: two HD cameras (one on the front
and back each), WiFi, 3G connectiv-
ity and a lightning connector. You can
buy a magnetic cover just like for the
big iPad, coming in 6 diﬀerent colours.
hey are priced quite competitively at
£270 to £530 for the diﬀerent models.
Summary
So what does this keynote mean for
you? Probably not much, unless you
are in the market for a new device. he
iMac and MacBook Pro look gorgeous,
as does the iPad mini. he new big iPad,
I believe, is a mistake on the part of Ap-
ple, as it makes a lot of consumers feel
like idiots right now. One question I do
have, and perhaps some of you will
also be thinking, is: “Are Apple on a
downwardslope?”heyappearnot
to be acting as creatively or mar-
ket leading anymore, but more
reacting to market pressure.
his is sad to think about, as
the innovation is what made
Apple so special. With their
edge looking increasingly
diminished at Cupertino,
it could easily give way for
competitors to take advantage
and make the step up.

FRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER
A
Windows 8 UK Launch
Jason Parmar
Technology Editor
I arrived with a mate to what is a pretty
standard PC World Currys on Totten-
ham Court Road sharp at 9pm. Sur-
prisingly, we found ourselves 66th in
line to the UK launch of Windows 8.
It may sound odd, I mean, who in
their right minds would queue for
anything that isn’t an Apple product?
And, no, I’m not a massive Microsoft
fanboy, despite last week’s edition of
Tech.
What was “special” about this prod-
uct launch, and the reason why I was
willing to spend 3 hours of my life
queuing, was the fact that declining
tech giant Hewlett-Packard, HP, (and
not Microsoft) were offering super dis-
counts on brand new Windows 8 lap-
tops and a free pair of beats with each
purchase to the first 300 customers in
the queue.
The company needed some good
publicity after reporting a 31% reduce
in profits Q2 this year and announcing
laying off of 29,000 employees. So
what better way to boost their repu-
tation and finances than by giving me
£1,200 of laptop for £650, plus two
douchebaggy Dr Dre Beats Solo HDs.
I’m not complaining, I got a good
deal, made a far bit of money and it
was actually pretty fun. But there was
one thing I couldn’t work out, why on
earth weren’t there more people?
They gave out free doughnuts, hot
dogs & drinks, entered us into com-
petitions and even had a US magician
there to entertain us – yet still, despite
the online publicity, the feature in The
Metro and more, there really weren’t
many people willing to wait a couple
of hours.
Maybe it’s because HP are seen as
seriously uncool, and I can definitely
see why. Despite all the good value,
the event honestly kind of stunk of a
desperate company that is trying far
too hard to be cool. Although I’m grate-
ful to HP, they really shouldn’t be try-
ing to create a similar hype to Apple.
They’re just not cool enough, and they
make seriously mediocre electronics.
