22 FRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER
Will Prince’s Weekend d’Integration
Will Prince
50 Shades of Gre(noble)
t must be about midnight
and I’m sitting on a sun
lounger in a dress I bought
from a supermarket several
hours earlier with puﬀer-
jacket-clad security guard checking
I don’t try and introduce myself to
the pool. Luckily I’ve already learnt
my lesson in this department, having
tried to introduce myself to someone
about ten minutes earlier, only to have
a drink poured over my head by their
boyfriend for “standing to close to
her”. Or at least that’s what I gleaned
as I tried hard to listen with my loose
grip on French.
So I’m sitting there, not really feel-
ing the beer-fruit juice cocktail drip
in places oﬀ my hair, when a larger
thought dawns on me, and not for the
ﬁrst time. “Fuck, I’m in France.”
I’m not talking about the pleasing,
picture-book, peering-out-of-plane-
window moment, the “oh look down
there, we’re in France” moment. No.
I’m talking about the dark, suddenly-
dawning “oh fuck, what’ve you done,
you’re here for the next ten months”
moment. A moment I was becoming
all too familiar with.
he same notion had come mind
about a week or so earlier when,
whilst crossing what was probably the
most pugent dance ﬂoor I’ve ever had
the pleasure to cross, the entire club
(no exaggeration) broke into a dance
as the DJ played “Who Let he Dogs
Out”. I was completely blindsided.
For the one, said DJ had, up until this
point, only played the kind of tracks
that you’d expect David Guetta to
consider for a set but ultimately throw
out, and for two, I had no fucking clue
what was going on. So I stood there,
waiting and watching this weird cross
between the Macarena and some
Moonie ritual, made all the weirder
for being acted out by a roomful of
sweaty French youths, many of whom
looked as though they were still try-
ing to shake oﬀ the ﬁnal shackles of
puberty. In retrospect, I think this is
what people refer to as a ‘cultural ex-
perience’ but at the time I had myself
an ‘oh fuck’ moment. Maybe that, af-
ter all, is the beauty of cultural experi-
ences. Who knows.
Another such moment came on
the coach ride to where we are now, a
small out-of-season ski resort, Lansle-
bourg, made all the more charming
for sounding like the ancestral home
of a certain former health minister.
he trip hadn’t started well. Ahead
of the ‘Weekend d’Integration’ (no
prizes for translating that one’) the
student body had been a-chatter with
rumours of where the secret destina-
tion might be. Having gone to Cannes
the previous year and with Grenoble
making the most of global warming,
both J-co (the other Anglophone Im-
perial export) and myself had packed
for a weekend at the beach. As those
of you diligent enough to have already
googled Lanslebourg will have found
out, beach is not something found in
its vicinity. So strapped into the coach
and clearly not heading for the coast,
our troubles were compounded as the
chanting began. ‘Mauvais ambience,’
translating basically as ‘bad smell’ and
repeated ad inﬁnitum, was a particu-
lar favourite, acted out by lifting one
arm in the air and patting the arm pit
with the opposite hand. At the start of
the trip it wasn’t one I’d heard before.
By the end, I had might as well had
it tattooed somewhere on my body,
visible to me, such was the degree to
which it was (and still is) ingrained in
my mind. I do wonder if, like stoners
and he Game, someone, years later,
will remind me of it, and a little world
inside my head will come crashing
down. Who knows.
At this point my drunken reverie is
shattered as J-Co, wearing the other
I
dress that came with mine (a snip at
€12 for two, a belated bid at fancy
dress), comes up to me and reminds
me that they’re about to start serving
TNT (a popular local cocktail made
from vodka, Orangina and a regional
55% percent liqueur, that they ration
to appear only once every hour) from
a hatch about 20 metres away.
No sooner had he said it, I knew
there were graver matters at hand
and I grasped around the ﬂoor for my
eco-cup (to be elaborated upon an-
other day). I closed my eyes,thought
of Metric, and staggered my way to
the queue.
The entire club
broke into a
dance as the
DJ played
‘Who Let The
Dogs Out’. I
was complete-
ly blindsided.
Don’t waste this space.
