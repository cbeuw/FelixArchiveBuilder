utumn Term’s all well
and good until all of
your assignments build
up at once and all of
your deadlines start
overlapping and all of your time dis-
appears and so on and so forth. It’s a
cycle that few can overcome.
So kick back, put your feet up on
the chair in front of you, take them
down again, sincerely apologise
when the person in front looks ag-
gravated, and peruse our list of alter-
native, quasi-philosophical questions
that are probably far more pressing
than any project you have going on at
the moment.
Should I really have that ready meal?
Oh, food wheel. here you go again,
taunting me with your monopoly of
red and orange sections. Check out
that sat fat section. It’s more crimson
than a plot of rhubarb under a par-
ticularly exposing light.
It’s not your fault, folks. he fridge
is bare, it’s been a late night in the
library, etc. etc. he reasons are
endless. After all, nothing would be
better right now than some proper
macaroni cheese, right?
If only there was a foodstuﬀ out

industry, much like any other indus-
try and much like life in general, has
been moving steadily through time
up until the present day. I guess you
could say that all of us, deep down,
are time travelling in some capacity.
Except when we’re not. I don’t know,
I’m not an expert.
Consider it.
How do I become a big city banker?
Get the jargon down to a tee, my
friend. Bamboozle your superiors
and even yourselves with impressive
sounding buzzwords and middling
Excel skills. here’s nothing to lose!
What is Coffee Break?
I don’t know.
That’s it.
And there we go, I hope the syn-
apses are ﬁring and that you are
feeling philosophically em-
powered. Head on out toward
your upcoming assignments
with renewed vigour and spirit. Or
something along those lines. Be
spectacularly dench, perhaps.
