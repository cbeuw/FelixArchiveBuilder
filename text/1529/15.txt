Although the origin of porridge is de-
batable, the Scots have been eating it
since the late medieval times to warm
themselves through the cold winters.
he UK gets through almost 50 mil-
lion gallons of the stuﬀ a year, seeing
a huge increase recently due to the
numerous health beneﬁts including:
low GI, high ﬁbre, high protein and
low fat. Despite this, many people still
picture a gloopy, wall paper paste-like
sludge resembling the gruel served up
in Oliver Twist, or manage to recreate
this by not understanding the subtle-
ties involved in preparing the tradi-
tional Scottish dish. Unfortunately,
we live in an instant society and many
opt for a microwavable, milky bland
pap which they cover in silly amounts
of sugar or chocolate in order to give
it any form of taste. After all, what
student has the time to spend 30 min-
utes idly stirring porridge before 9am
lectures? I certainly don’t, but when-
ever I have a late start or on weekends
I always invest the time into making
the truly delicious and traditional
breakfast.
he main and key ingredient in por-
ridge is of the course the oats. After
being harvested and cleaned, the oat
are de-hulled by a machine, leaving
the groat. his is then heated to just
over 100ºC to break down the lipol-
ytic enzymes, which would spoil the
oats if left. From here the groats are
either broken into pieces giving raw
oatmeal or steamed and rolled to
make rolled oats. hese ‘rolled oats’
make up practically all those found
in the supermarket including: Quak-
er Oats, Jordans Organic Porridge
Oats, Scott’s Porage Oats and also
the instant varieties such as Ready
Brek. Despite this, porridge purists,
and any self-respecting restaurant,
will always use the raw oatmeal, the
coarsest ground is known as pinhead
oatmeal. You should be able to buy
these at most whole foods shops and
sometimes in Waitrose. Although
they take longer to cook, and require
soaking overnight, they produce a sig-
niﬁcantly more textured and ﬂavour-
some porridge.
As for the liquid, you should use
only water when cooking the por-
ridge, milk is usually added after-
wards to form a cooling milky moat.
Although many people use either
milk or a water/milk mix, I think it
masks the taste of the oats and in fact
and leaves the porridge blander. Put-
ting milk in porridge is much like put-
ting sugar in tea; don’t be a hooligan,
leave it out.

Mason’s Oats
Ingredients:
1/3 pint of pinhead oatmeal
1 pint of Scottish mineral water
A pinch of sea salt
A splash of milk and/or your favourite top-
ping - blueberries or raspberries are good
Method:
The night before, combine the water and oats
in a saucepan and leave to soak overnight.
Bring the oats to a boil whilst stirring continu-
ously with a spurtle (traditional wooden stir-
ring stick) or wooden spoon. Ensure you stir
with your right hand and in a clockwise direc-
tion, otherwise risk invoking the devil into
your breakfast. Simmer the oats for around 15
minutes whilst continuously stirring, until the
porridge becomes thick yet still pourable. At
this point, add the salt and leave to rest off the
heat for 5 minutes. Adding salt beforehand will
stiffen the oats and ruin the texture. Serve out
the porridge into bowls; it is common to add a
splash of milk or cream. Pour yourself a glass of
hand-warm scotch whiskey and enjoy!
