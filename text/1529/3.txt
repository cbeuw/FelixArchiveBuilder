Uni applications fall
Figures released by UCAS (Universi-
ties and Colleges Admissions Service)
over the summer show that almost
44,000 less home students applied
to study at UK universities for 2012
entry than did for 2011 entry, repre-
senting a drop of 8.7%. UCAS analysis
suggests that, accounting for changes
in population size and long term ap-
plication patterns, 15,000 less indi-
viduals have applied than had been
expected to.
Science subjects do seem to have
suﬀered the least compared to the
arts. Physics, for example, actually
saw an increase of 8.3% from last
year. Other, smaller, subjects, such as
Biotechnology, even saw an increase
of about 20%. However, as less peo-
ple do the subject, it takes a smaller
number of people to increase to make
a large looking ﬂuctuation. Mechani-
cal Engineering and Biology were the
other science subjects to see a rise
in demand. All other scientiﬁc disci-
plines had a dip in applications. Civil
engineering was the worst hit, with
a decrease of 12.1%. his comes at
a time when he Royal Academy of
Engineering reported that there is a
danger of there being a shortfall in
the number of engineering graduates.
he report stated that 100,000 engi-
neering graduates a year were needed
to maintain the status quo, with Pro-
fessor Matthew Harrison of the Royal
Academy of Engineering saying that
“Engineering ﬁrms are crying out for
engineers”.
At about 42,000 less students apply-
ing than in 2011, most of the decrease
is accounted for by those resident
in England. From 2012 they may be
charged up to £9,000 a year to study
at any UK university. he average fee
this year is £8,385 this year, which is
expected to rise to £8,507 next year.
Scottish universities do not charge
any fees to Scottish students while
fees at universities in Northern Ire-
land are capped at £3,465 for students
domiciled there. he Welsh assem-
bly pays all fees above £3,465 for any
Welsh student studying at any UK
university. Application numbers from
these parts of the UK have remained
relatively stable.
Research by the Guardian, however,
found that most young people are still
planning to undertake some form of
higher education. Furthermore analy-
sis by the Independent Commission
on Fees found that application rates to
the most prestigious Universities have
remained constant and the decline in
application numbers that there has
been “greatest in the most advantaged
neighbourhoods” which indicated
that “any potential impact from high-
er tuition fees does not appear to be
having a disproportionate impact on
those” who are worst oﬀ.

Students scare The Living Day-
lights out of health and safety
In a statement Will Hutton — the
Commission and principle of Hert-
ford College, Oxford — warned that
it is “very early days” to be able to un-
derstand the full impact of the tuition
fee increase. He believes that some
of those who did not apply this year
might well “come back next year” —
particularly given the poor state of the
jobs market. Universities minister Da-
vid Willets added: “We do accept that
after a peak last year, applications are
down from 31.6% of people applying
to university to 30.6%. hat is actually
still the second highest rate of appli-
cations on record. We still have very
strong demand for university.”
Others reactions to the ﬁgures has
been more critical. Shadow universi-
ties minister Shabana Mahmood said
that “It is clear that the drastic in-
crease in fees and the increased debt
burden is putting people of all ages
oﬀ going to university and investing
in their future. Most students will be
paying oﬀ their debts most of their
working lives.” Even Hutton admitted
that: “We’re asking our young men
and women to assume more debt than
any other country in the world – it’s
higher than the average debt in the
US. It’s not clear whether those lost
this year will return to the fold next
year, or [if] it’s a storm warning of a
worrying trend.”
Last week, Felix reported that stu-
dents had found their way onto the
roof of Beit using the sheer mental
power provided to the excellent stu-
dents of this institution. Stephwen
Hughes, Head of Health, Safety & Fire
at Imperial College London, followed
up with the following statement:
“Students have placed themselves
at considerable risk by deliberately
breaching the measures put in place
by the College to prevent unauthor-
ised persons accessing hazardous ar-
eas. he measures including window
restrictors and controlled access doors
are there for the safety and wellbeing
of staﬀ and students who will not be
aware of the risk presented by the roof
and balconies.
I would take this opportunity to re-
mind students that they have a duty,
under health and safety law and Col-
lege policy, to co-operate fully with all
measures put in place by the College
to safeguard their safety and well-
being. hey are also responsible for
their own safety and that of others
who could be aﬀected by their acts or
omissions.
he College will now put additional
measures in place to avoid a repeat of
such an incident.
