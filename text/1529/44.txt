Slitherlink
Countdown
Yet another Slitherlink. To solve it, you need
to make a single closed loop by joining the
dots so that numbered squares are surround-
ed by the corresponding number of lines (e.g.
a square numbered “3” must have a line seg-
ment on three of its sides).

Saunterblugget Hampterfuppinshire reminisce about this year’s Moonlight Ball.

else “at least three of us are knaves”, and so forth until everyone had had a go.
Duke: Sadly, everyone paired off after that and the Reverend couldn’t find a dance
partner. At least one person in the ball had a good time, though.
Reverend:Oh,Duchess,neverbeforehasitbeenclearerthatyourmarriageistainted
by at least one knave amongst you.
Duchess: Agreed,Reverend.(turning to her husband)Do stop lying, Herb.
Who’s a knight and who’s a knave? How successful was the ball?
If “ja” means “no”, Aaron says that at least one of them is a knave, effectively claiming Barbara
is a knave (since nobody can claim to be a knave themselves). Then Barbara says he is a knight.

on is a knight, then Barbara is a knight who is lying, so Aaron is a knave, and Barbara a knight.
