The Power of Bugs in Today’s Climate Crisis
We all know the climate crisis is not one to be ignored for many reasons: increased natural disasters, extinction of
wild animals, rising sea levels, food shortages and many more – but microorganisms may be the one to watch

From daily news
features to public trans-
port disruptions and
political manifestos,
climate change and all its
consequences have finally
become impossible to
ignore. As temperatures
rise, our relationship
with nature will have to
begrudgingly adjust. This
adjustment will certainly
involve the weathering
of unprecedented natural
disasters – droughts,
wildfires, pollution, food
shortages and sinking
cities. But, just as impor-
tantly, our interaction with
other living organisms
will also undergo a sub-
stantial transformation.
We all hear the same
stories about wild animals
on the verge of extinction,
decliningnumbersofbees,
forests being demolished
to accommodate capitalist
greed and crop failure.
Less widely known is
what happens to bugs (or
rather microorganisms) in
a climate crisis – so what
goes on?
Humans and microbes
have co-evolved over
hundreds of thousands of
years of a relatively steady
climate state. There are
bacteria and viruses, such
as the gut microbiome,
that we happily co-exist
with; and there are mi-
croorganisms that wreak
havoc on our bodies and
immune system, causing
dangerous disease and
sometimes death. Our
relationship with the latter
type of microorganisms
is often described as an
arms race, with humans
occasionally gaining the
upper hand over a virus
or a bacterium with the
serendipitous discovery
of a new drug or vaccine.
However, with antibiotic
resistance on the rise, and
the compounded effects
of climate change, it looks
like we may be ceding
our advantage. With
global warming comes
change; both old and
new microorganisms can
re-surface, re-locate or
even re-evolve into more
dangerous forms.
Melting ice caps and
in its duration, claimed
more lives than World
War I) in a mass grave in
Alaska. Moreover, it is
suspected that smallpox
and bubonic plague are
buried in Siberia, raising
the frightening possibility
that these 18th
and 19th
century diseases, once
thought to be extinct, can
re-surface and re-infect
the human species.
In a stable climate, the
endemic zones of certain
microorganism-spread
diseases are geographical-
ly well demarcated. Vec-
tor-borne viruses, such
as dengue, yellow fever
and zika, are restricted to
tropical areas where their
mosquito carriers thrive
- but as temperatures rise
and the tropics expand,
these can rapidly conquer
new territories. Indeed,
yellow fever, originally
restricted to the Amazon
basin, has now spread
through the rainforest
and reached Brazil’s two
largest cities, São Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro, with
a 34% case-fatality rate.
Mosquitoes spreading
zika and dengue are also
on the move, with current
models forecasting that
by 2050 nearly half of the
world’s population will be
at risk of one of these two
perilous infections.
Current research is
already focused on inves-
tigating microorganisms
that may resurface using
DNA analysis to evaluate
their infectious capabili-
ties and antibiotic suscep-
tibilities. Vaccines against
mosquito-borne diseases
are in the pipeline, with
new promising candidates
emerging every year. In
this arms race, we appear
to be one step ahead. But
we cannot forget about
our bodies, which also
contain trillions of micro-
organisms – on our skin,
in the mouth, lungs and
the gut, all of which are
crucial to our health. At
the present moment, we
have evolved a mutually
beneficial relationship
with these, forming a
symbiotic microbiome.
But as the climate
changes, this relationship
can reinvent itself in un-
predictable ways.
In 2015, nearly two-
thirds of the global
population of the saiga
antelope died within just
a couple of days, over
a large region in central
Kazakhstan. The cause
of this mass extinction
event was revealed to be
a bacterial infection - the
bacteria Pasteurella mul-
tocida typically lives in
the saiga’s tonsils without
causing any harm, but the
unprecedented humidity
levels and elevated
summer temperatures led
to the bacteria’s rapid pro-
liferation and its invasion
of the bloodstream and
vital organs, killing the
antelopes. As Ed Yong
wrote in The Atlantic:
“Climate is the trigger.
Pasteurella is the bullet.”
As the planet is
slowly warming up, we
are leaving behind the
environment that sup-
ported our evolution and
survival; the environment
that has maintained the
precarious status quo
between us and microbes.
With rising temperatures
come new evolutionary
pressures, and microor-
ganisms are notoriously
better at adapting than us.
So who will win?
