The anger of an exhausted Iraqi youth against a 16-
year old corruptible political system

housands of
Iraqi youngsters,
from central and
southern cities
and from all religious
groups, have been taking
the streets since October
1st against the worsening
economic conditions,
the divisive government
policies, and widespread
corruption that afﬂicts
Iraq. The government
has reacted viciously to
the protests – even by the
standards of the Middle
East. Security forces have
ﬁred rubber bullets, live
ammunition, and tear gas
at the raging crowd who
were armed with nothing
but the Iraqi ﬂag. Snipers
were deployed atop tall
buildings to threaten and
frighten the protestors.
The insurgents
occupied all ﬂoors of an
empty, six-story Turkish
restaurant standing
opposite to Tahrir Square.
Both the building and
Tahrir Square have
become the symbols and
fortresses of this protest.
Their main demands
were for snipers to be
withdrawn, the political
cabinet to be restructured,
and unemployment and
corruption to be fought. In
response, the government
threatened to dismiss any
governmental employee
who participated in the
protests and issued a city-
wide curfew. This only
led the protests to grow,
and on October 25th, the
riots spread to other prov-
inces of the country, this
time the demand was the
abolishment of the entire
political system.
The rage of the demon-
strators has been directed
at high unemployment
levels and the practice of
assigning governmental
posts based on partisan
loyalties and ethnic
afﬁliations rather than
credentials and qualiﬁ-
cations. The ruling elite
are accused of misusing
funds, poorly managing
state resources, and
failing to meet even the
most basic needs of the
Iraqi people – jobs and
basic public services.
Outrage is also directed
at the political system
enforced upon them by
the Americans following
the 2003 invasion and
overthrowal of dictator
Saddam Hussein. Since
the downfall of Hussein,
the inﬂuence of religious
ﬁgures and politicians
from the neighbouring
country Iran have grown
markedly in Iraq. Irani-
an-backed militias roam
around the country, like
maﬁa-esque extortion
groups, causing unre-
lenting anxiety for Iraqi
citizens. Furthermore,
Hundreds of young men
from cities like Basra and
Nasiriyah lost their lives
ﬁghting ISIS.
But once ISIS was
defeated, the contradic-
tions came to light. Many
young men returning from
the war were shocked to
realisehowgreatthesocial
injustice among the Shia’
was. When a government
delegation visited Nasiri-
yah, the demonstrators
complained that little had
changed for the people
since Saddam. At that
time, the Shia’ of Nasiri-
yah had been suppressed,
today they suffered again
hardship, while the party
elites enjoyed all the
beneﬁts of gaining power
and the victory of terror.
The young people
can no longer be put off
with solemn religious
words previously used
by the government to
rule the country. This
was the case in 2006 and
2014, which both led to
infamous civil wars that
ended in bloodshed. One
of the ﬁrst slogans of the
Demonstrations in central Bagdhad // Ziyad Matti
“Baghdad will
be free”
many Iraqi politicians
and militias have become
loyal to Iran, submitting
the country’s government
to Iran’s bidding, whilst
Iraqis, despite the coun-
try’s vast oil reserves,
have neither medical care,
safety, nor good educa-
tion.
The Iraqi people’s
anger at Iran’s increasing
authority is understand-
able, though corruption
in Iraq cannot be solely
blamed on the Tehran
regime. This protest is
larger than that – it repre-
sents a ﬁght by the restless
masses of a younger gen-
eration of Iraqis who are
tired; having witnessed
countless wars, from the
2003 invasion, to the civil
war in 2006 and ISIS in
2014. They are struggling
to scratch out a living and
are entirely rejecting their
corrupt government.
This is an unprecedent-
ed situation for the Iraqi
government. Because
compared to previous
conﬂicts in Iraq, now it
is largely Shia’s who are
facing each other. Anyone
who thinks of clashes in
Iraq solely a result of a
conﬂict between Sunnis
and Shia’s may ﬁnd that
strange.
And it is not the ﬁrst
time that Shia’s have
clashed with Shia’s.
Saddam Hussain was at
an 8-year long war with
Shi’ite Iran, but two-thirds
of his army consisted of
Shia’s – peasants, poor
Iraqisfromthesouth,afew
Kurds – while the senior
ofﬁcers and generals were
mostly Sunnis. When the
Shia’ majority in Iraq
came to power follow-
ing the fall of Saddam,
the Shia’ south was the
government’s mainstay.
uprising was “The thieves
robbed us in the name of
religion”. This is reﬂected
by the presence of Shia’s,
Sunnis, Christians and
Yezidis on the streets of
Baghdad today; united
in their hatred towards
the government and the
earnest feeling that they
see no future in their
country. And for that they
“This protest
respresents
a fight by the
restless masses
of a younger
generation of
Iraqis who are
tired”
Following almost two decades of war, inequality and corruption, Iraqi youth are taking to the streets to voice their
anger.

apparatus in Iraq.
The protest has reached
its 32nd day. It is yet
unknown how long it will
last and if it will be fruitful.
But one thing is clear, the
way the government has
been dealing with the in-
surgents will not certify an
end to the demonstrations.
The people will not just
leave the streets and go
home because they are
aware that once they have
withdrawn, nothing will
