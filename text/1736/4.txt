T
he Managing
Director of
the Union,
Jarlath O’Hara,
announced on 18th No-
vember that he will be
stepping down from his
role at the end of Decem-
ber. The announcement
was made via an email
sent internally to ICU
staff, and marks the end
of Jarlath’s four-year
tenure in the role.
In the email, the only
reason provided for the
decision was that “the time
is right for someone new
to lead on developing the
Union through the years
ahead.” The news comes
as the Union is developing
its new three-year strategy
for the 2020-2023 period.
Jarlath’s departure
marks the first member
of the Union’s Senior
Management Group to be
caught in the recent wave
of resignations from the
Union, which has resulted
in a severe short-staffing
Management Group.
The resignation notice
followed a meeting with
Jill Finney, the Chair of
the Union’s Board of
Trustees – the body which
provides oversight to the
activities of the Union as a
whole – after prior discus-
sions firstly amongst the
external Trustees on the
Board, and then including
the Officer Trustees (the
Union President and
Deputy Presidents, who
are student representa-
tives), who also sit on the
Board.
The email was shortly
followed by another from
Jill on behalf of the Board
of Trustees, in which
next steps were clarified.
Specifically, it was noted
that the College would be
providing support and that
an interim “operations-fo-
cused” measure would be
put in place while recruit-
ment for a new Managing
Director is ongoing.
This was followed on
Tuesday 26th with an
email from the Union
President, Abhijay Sood,
on behalf of Jill, con-
taining a confirmation
that the interim measure
would constitute senior
Support Services Direc-
tors and their teams from
within College, and that
Jon Tucker, the Faculty
Operating Officer for the
Business School, would
be acting as lead on
providing said support.
Faculty Operating Of-
ficers generally provide
leadership on delivering
operational support within
faculties, and are often
responsible for things
such as administrative
functions and planning or
budgetary activities.
The process of select-
ing Jon was reportedly
managed primarily by Jill,
after discussions with the
external and Officer Trus-
tees. A request was put in
to College for suggestions
for which College staff
members may be suitable.
Out of the candidates, Joe
Cooper (formerly staff
at the Union who then
moved to College HR)
endorsed Jon. The Officer
Trustees confirmed they
were happy with the selec-
tion, though they will only
be officially meeting with
Jon in this capacity for the
first time on Monday.
The College is already
heavily involved with
supporting Union op-
erations after the high
staff turnover has left
gaps in service provi-
sion. Examples include
the backlog of room
When queried about
whether College’s in-
volvement would interfere
with the Union’s remit of
advocating for students,
which may require an
oppositional stance
against College decisions,
Abhijay said:
“We welcome the
support being offered by
College. Of course we
have to be wary of areas
where there might be con-
flicts of interest, but when
it comes to Jon and the
other staff members, my
understanding is they're
here to help us fix some
of the fundamentals (e.g.
Health and Safety). They
aren't here to set a new
strategic direction for the
Union or give input on
what stance we take with
College in a negotiation.
To be clear, Jon isn't the
new Jarlath; while we'll
be getting help for some
of Jarlath's current day-to-
day responsibilities, this
isn't us appointing a new
Managing Director.”
However, the email
distributed by Abhijay on
behalf of Jill Finney stated
that the working relation-
ship will include long-
term strategic advice:
“Jon will also be working
with the President, the
Officer Trustees, the
Senior management team
and Board of Trustees to
help us review our strat-
egy and priorities both in
the short term and looking
to the longer term.”
As a result, what
precise role Jon Tucker
and, as an extension, the
College will play in the
Union’s ongoing strategy
and decision-making
remains unclear and will
reportedly be fleshed out
in the coming week.
Managing Director of the Union Steps Down
