Binge of the Week: Russian Doll

Russian Doll
follows Nadia
Vulvokov (played by
Natasha Lyonne), a soft-
ware developer who finds
herself stuck in a time loop
where she repeatedly dies
and mysteriously relives
her 36th birthday party.
Nadia has to fix the “bug”
in the code that is her life
in order to escape this
inevitable crash. On her
quest for an answer, she
finds her polar-opposite,
Alan Zaveri (played by
Charlie Barnett), who ex-
periences the same thing.
Together, they must face
their deepest fears and
help each other out to get
out of this sticky situation.
The highlight of the
show is none other than
Natasha Lyonne. The
entire series is framed
around Nadia, although
it’s not labeled as a
one-woman show, it’s
honestly not far from
it. Lyonne’s spectacular
acting brings the character
of Nadia to life, and part
of that can be attribut-
ed to how closely her
personal life resembles
that of Nadia’s. On the
outside, like Nadia, she
grows up in an estranged
Jewish family in New
York and suffers health
problems due to her
alcohol and substance
abuse problems. But what
is really impressive is her
poignant delivery and
how she conveys Nadia’s
emotional turmoil under-
neath her carefree, hippy
facade. Lyonne’s portray-
al of Nadia, the strikingly
idiosyncratic redhead has
undoubtedly created yet
another New York icon.
This is not to undermine
the supporting characters
of the show who are some
of the most well-written
that I have seen.
The plot is yet another
highlight for me and is es-
sentially what bridges the
genres of drama, comedy,
mystery, and horror. Upon
my first watch, I felt the
plot started off rather slow
with coincidences unrea-
sonably stretched. It was
the mystery elements that
I didn’t quite get the first
time around, but overall
I still found it enjoyable.
It’s the rewatch that made
me appreciate Russian
Doll on another level.
There’s a layer of depth
to the series that I wasn’t
able to grasp when I first
watched it. Every scene is
crafted with such attention
to detail, serving as a way
for character development
or to foreshadow what’s
to come eventually. In this
show, not a single second
is wasted.
Something that helps
explain the mechanics
of time traveling in this
particular case is Nadia’s
programming analogy
(which coincidentally
fits her character). If
her life were a program,
then being stuck in this
unending loop is the
crash, and the way out
is to find and fix the bug
of her life. Then she and
Alan would “rewrite”
their first interaction, run
a unit test, “see if the bug
is triggered,” and if it is,
they would both die and
go back to the deli where
it all started. This explains
why in the subsequent
episodes certain charac-
ters disappear into thin
air - it’s their way to de-
termine if the bug is trig-
gered, by stripping down
the program to its absolute
core. Every movie or TV
show that deals with
time-traveling always
finds itself in need of a
scene of explanation, and
I thought Russian Doll’s
metaphor to achieve this
is pretty neat.
As a cinematography
nerd, I want to applaud the
cinematographer Chris
Teague for Russian Doll’s
unique visual language
that perfectly ties in the
cyclical time elements
with the New York
setting. It blends subtlety
and vibrancy that brings
out the retro, depressing
city vibes with Teague’s
creative use of neon lights
in the dark. Different
filters are used with
exceptional precision to
convey the mood and tone
of each scene or character,
but Teague manages to
maintain a cohesive style
throughout the show. The
flashback scenes are shot
with older lenses and
feature a warmer colour
palette. Part of what distin-
guishes between a horror
and a comedic scene is
the cinematography. Not
to mention how perfect
every detail is in the
classic reset scene where
Nadia finds herself res-
urrected in the bathroom
of Maxine’s (played by
Greta Lee) loft, accompa-
nied by Harry Nilsson’s
“Gotta Get Up.” The final
scene concludes the series
so satisfyingly and a huge
part of it can be attributed
to the cinematography.
Russian Doll is not only
full of unexpected twists
and turns but also impor-
tant overarching themes
that echo throughout the
series told through a beau-
tiful, gripping story. I am
delighted to hear that the
show has been renewed
for a second season, and I
cannot wait to see where
the writers take this show.
A fascinating tale based on the classic “Groundhog Day” premise, featuring time loops, bug-fixing, comedic
horrors, and facing fears
