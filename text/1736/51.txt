Imperial College
London finally sends
in Union security over
allegations of an
illegal marketplace

mperial College
London is finally
responding to claims
by a Union Staff
member that a large black
market is being operated
out of West Basement.
The Union Staff member
alleged that the black
market has been providing
students with critically de-
sired items, such as mental
health support, curly fries
and adderall.
Staff member Arlath a
Hora claimed that it was
impossible for the Union
to operate with this kind
of competition: “They
are capable of getting stu-
dents whatever they need,
exactly when they need it.
Previously, we have been
able to offer a pisspoor
service simply because
we operate a monopoly on
campus. Maybe if there
was some competition,
we’d actually have to do
our jobs properly. The
horror!”
Although the market
was initially set up in
response to the demand
for study drugs to get
procrastinating students
through exams, over the
past three months, it has
rapidly branched out into
many other crucial aspects
of student life. One
anonymous black-market
racketeer told Negafelix
in an exclusive inter-
view, “Yeah, we can get
someone counselling
support almost immedi-
ately, with almost no wait
time. It’s just a matter of
means testing what people
can afford, with those
that need the service and
are better off subsidising
those that wouldn’t be
able to. Pretty amazing
how many counsellors
you can hire when you
run that funding struc-
ture.” Another vendor told
Negafelix that, “since the
closure of the Union bar,
we’ve been making an
absolute mint. Students
will pay almost anything
to get their hands on curly
fries or a tasteless greasy
pizza. Some don’t just pay
either. We’ve had to start
turning down offers to do
our coursework for us.”
Negafelix was delight-
ed by the high standard of
hygeine upon observing
the black market kitchen.
“We’ve got rats, but after
some fairly high-powered
and tense negotiations,
we’ve managed to arrange
a confidence and supply
deal. They help us get
the authentic union taste
by running around the
kitchen surfaces and food
and we agreed that they
can keep their nests by
the fridge. It’s been easier
negotiating with them
than the cockroaches.
Bastards.”
Union security ratted
out the black market early
today, through efficient
use of one-way signage
and a bloody-minded
approach to the rules.
Although sellers were
disappointed, one saw a
bright future ahead. “The
way the university is going
with regards to rent in-
creases in student accom-
modation, we’re going to
move into cheap, nasty
and unsafe flats, purpose
built for the poorer aspira-
tional student. If Imperial
aren’t prepared to take the
opportunity to exploit the
paupers that want to come
here, we sure as hell will.”
When approached
for comment with these
concers, Galice Fast
responded by hissing and
coiling tighter around a
large pile of gold, covered
in biscuit crumbs.
