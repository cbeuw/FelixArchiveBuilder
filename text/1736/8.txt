H
ong Kong. An
asphalt jungle
lit by neon
lights. The
brutal trek up the Tiger’s
Head and down towards
the beaches of Discovery
Bay. A mere cog in the
global economy machin-
ery. For me it was all that
and more. But somehow
six thousand miles away
from the city I called
home, I’ve now come to
realise I never knew it at
all. This my dear reader, is
my confession.
In September, I boarded
the flight CX251 and
left the only home I had
ever known. I must have
dropped my heart and
soul somewhere on aisle
C because it was gone by
the time I got here. I like
to think it’s debilitating
powerlessness that I feel,
because the alternative – a
detached numbness that
comes with not caring
enough – is far worse.
I wished for a thousand
sleepless nights, and upon
a dying star I found guilt
to keep me company at
night. When the lo-fi beats
are left on playback it
comes knocking on my
door. Traitor, traitor…
You have no right to speak
of your home. I welcome
it in with open arms each
night. It reminds me that
there is no joy, only guilt.
In exchange I am
relieved of duty. I only
read the headlines each
morning. I skip the videos
and skim the updates. So
little time to spare. So little
time to care. Yes, I shed a
tear when I watched the
world speeds by at an
incomprehensible pace?
There should be a word
to describe it if there isn’t
already. It’s where I went
to leave the world behind.
I stayed there for a day,
a week, a lifetime. Until
a chirp-less robin visited
me and made roost on my
parapet.
It sought company in
silence. But the silence
was mine and mine alone.
From the fragrant
harbour it had come, and
back to the harbour it
went. I pitied the bird that
flew six thousand miles
just to lose its voice. And
so, I followed it out of
the bubble, if only just
to mock its unfortunate
circumstance. Like Mel-
pomene on a new year I
laugh.
The fragrant harbour it
came from is long gone.
Once a small fishing port
where the sea met the
sand. If you wandered out
too far from the shore,
you’d catch the siren call
of pink-flushed dolphins.
It was poor before it
prospered. It too, bled in
the war. It too, has had
its share of sickness and
disease.
My home lost to the
winds.
I mourn the death of
Hong Kong as we once
knew it. It is far too late,
and far too easy to talk
about right and wrong.
That line has been buried
under the blood, sweat
and tears or both sides.
Protestors, they lash out
in desperation. The police
lash out in frustration.
Fake news tears wider
the rift between the two
sides. Misinformation
cheapens the sacrifices
that have been made.
Emotionally charged
videos spread through the
internet, preying on the
high tensions and volatile
emotions. But only in
their respective algorith-
mic bubbles. Why look to
the US when we are but
a bargaining chip? They
won’t have HK’s best
interests at heart.
Hypocrisy in action,
andininaction.Blindunity
in the factions allowing
injustice to thrive. Dis-
honourable tactics and
irredeemable actions have
lost the police force any
respect they had built. The
no-compromise stance
adopted on both sides.
Protests and gatherings
being banned, forcing
protestors to embrace il-
legality in the movement.
Dehumanising the enemy
to justify the slow descent
into full out brawls. Lone,
independent actors with
senseless actions that
have pervaded any moral
ground either side held.
The general mistrust of
the PRC and now by
extension the Hong Kong
Government. Even the
sanctity of free press has
been called into question.
Perception is far more
potent than the truth.
Whether or not the gov-
ernment is a conniving
bastard doesn’t matter.
The fact that the people
see them as such does.
Negotiations and talks
have no meaning without
trust.
Therein lies the
dilemma. How is resolu-
tion even possible without
a complete crackdown
or complete reform?
Further convoluting the
situation is the leaderless
structure of the protests.
No structure for official
negotiation. I believe the
government is trying, but
rhetorical appeasement
has proved insufficient
in the face of all the bot-
tled-up frustration.
All of the violence is
merely a symptom of a
wound left unattended.
For an blissful 20 years we
treated 2047, the distant
date of total reunification,
as a bridge to be crossed
when we get there instead
of confronting the inevi-
table redintegration back
to the Mainland. Perhaps
I should reword it, for 20
years we have given the
control of our future to the
said, no. Bootleggers
crossed the border causing
severe milk-powder
shortages. Middle-aged
women came to perform
for lonely men in the parks
for money. Disappearanc-
es of book vendors with
“politically incorrect”
publications. And in 2010
a whole 36.9% of the
babies born in Hong Kong
didn’t have a single parent
that was a Hong Kong
resident. That’s not even
to mention the forced
construction of the high-
speed rail connecting the
mainland and downtown
HK a whole different can
of worms. I mean, who’d
have guessed half an hour
bus ride is no deterrent?
Not even the Sonoran
Desert would stop them.
2014 was when we tried
to take the steering wheel
with universal suffrage.
We came, we saw, we lost.
In the subsequent years
many of those who par-
ticipated were silenced,
sentenced and jailed
while society moved on.
The gears of economy
never stopped for the little
harbour. Housing prices
continued climbing, the
average property in HK
costs $1.2 million. For
430 sq ft.
Here we are today in
2019, the situation ever
so dire. My aim today
is to show you how
complex the situation is.
Each sentence could be
an article, each article an
essay. There isn’t a one
size fit all. I’ve heard
people say, “Let the army
storm the city to restore
order!” Just as I’ve heard
someone say, “We can go
full revolution with Hong
Kong Independence!”
Asinine remarks thrown
around in ignorance.
I don’t have the truth,
nor does anyone else who
claims to do so. Maybe we
are foolish for fighting,
maybe we are wrong. At
least we fought knowing
we are in this together. For
those who have chosen to
continue the good fight
with their hearts fuelled
by righteous faith, I quote
to you Dylan Thomas
“Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.” As we
wield our sword (or pen)
in the name of justice, let
us carry a healthy dose of
cynicism and self-critique
lest we forget that the road
to hell is paved with good
intentions. If my article
has incited anger, then I
have failed.
To stop and listen, is to
give voice to those who
cannot be heard over the
crowd. Blue. Yellow. On
the fence. I ask for simple
reprieve. An interlude
of last green in waning
light. A moment of silence
for those that have died
for their ideals; officers
injured in the line of duty;
teenagers who have made
this their fight; parents
who just pray for safe
returns; and children that
will grow up in a divided
family.
The battle has long
ago turned into a war of
attrition. And while the
city still burns in the back-
ground, I think it is time
to take off the collimator.
Away from the fragrant
harbour… Westwards to
Lebanon, Egypt, France,
Chile, Peru... In fact, all
the other places that have
fought in the dark. My
heart goes out to every
single one of you. This
world is far too small of a
place for us to not give a
damn.

was shot. But then I
moved on. I had lectures
to watch. Problem sheets
to hand in.
