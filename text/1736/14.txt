T
he Greens have
produced a man-
ifesto embracing
the ‘Green New
Deal’ branding, with the
boldest climate target of
all – a 100% net zero econ-
omy by 2030 achieved by
spending £100bn every
year through borrowing
and increased taxation.
Green also promise to
build 100,000 extra ze-
ro-carbon homes, raising
spending on the NHS to
£6bn a year, and scrapping
tuition fees.
Greenhouse gases
come from many sources
including the agricultural
sector, and the Greens will
phase in a tax on meat and
dairy products over the
next 10 years. Methane
is an incredibly potent
greenhouse gas and a lot
of it comes from cows, so
this policy may well be
justiﬁed – however it is
unclear how this tax will
affect consumers. If meat
and dairy prices rise and
are made unaffordable
for people, then they may
well be forced to switch
to a more environmen-
tally-friendly vegan diet
– however this does seem
like passing the cost on to
ordinary working people
when another policy could
try and achieve the same
result without punishing
those who can’t afford to
pay more in tax.
The Greens have also
promised £2bn a year
for apprenticeships and
training for those transi-
tioning to green jobs.
With £2.5bn promised
for improved cycle
routes, the Greens aim to
make cycling a safer and
friendlier option. Despite
this, there are no policies
on how they will improve
and promote public
transport usage and how
they will do this while the
majority of public trans-
port is owned by private
companies.
Green have also
proposed a Universal
Basic Income of £89 a
week to replace existing
beneﬁts. However, a UBI
is meant to get rid of the
administrative burden of
means testing found in
most welfare systems, yet
the Greens’ UBI proposal
has means testing in it
to provide families, the
elderly, and disabled
people with more money.
This begs the question
of why they want to
introduce an expensive
UBI programme while
getting rid of one of the
main beneﬁts of it, which
is to reduce administrative
costs for the state.
The Greens have been
criticised in interviews
recently for their bold
borrowing and spending
commitments, however
my view is that when
dealing with the exis-
tential crisis of climate
change, we can’t really
afford not to take bold
action.

T
itled “It’s time
for real change”,
the Labour man-
ifesto certainly
lives up to that promise.
Labour have promised
large spending increases
to combatting the major
crises that face our nation
in the present.
Climate change is
for many, the greatest
issue faced by humanity.
Labour have committed
to 90% of electricity to
be supplied by renewable
sources by 2030. Workers
in high carbon industries
won’t be left behind;
instead, with Labour’s
proposed National Ed-
ucation Service (NES)
providing free education
and training from cradle
to grave, workers will
be able to transition into
renewable and low carbon
industries.
Under Labour, tuition
fees will be scrapped
and maintenance grants
will be reintroduced for
students. Free bus travel
for under 25s will promote
the use of public transport,
which will further forward
Labour’s environmental
objectives. Taking key in-
dustries into public own-
ership, such as rail, mail,
water and the energy grid,
makes promoting public
transport and decarbon-
ising our energy system
easier, while improving
the services and reducing
costs for service users as
value will no longer be
siphoned off to line the
wallets of shareholders.
Labour is also proposing
to roll out free ﬁbre optic
broadband for all, as
currently only 8% of the
UK has access to full ﬁbre
broadband.
Labour aims to raise
the minimum wage im-
mediately to £10 an hour,
stop state pension age
rises and build 100,000
council homes a year to
end the homelessness
crisis. With regards to the
NHS, Labour has com-
mitted to making dentistry
checkups free and abolish
prescription charges in
England, giving the NHS
the funding it deserves. A
further key policy is the
32 hour working week
with no loss of pay.
In order to pay for all
this, Labour has produced
a fully costed “grey book”
that outlines the tax
revenue coming in and the
spending going out, and
insisted that only the top
5% of earners would pay
more tax. However this
week, Labour admitted
that a plan to equalise
the tax status between
married and non-mar-
ried couples would see
married couples losing a
tax break – which would
affect earners below
the top 5% threshold.
However, this week also
saw the release of a letter
in the Financial Times
written by 163 economists
and academics, backing
Labour’s spending plans.
With the scale of the
climate and housing crises
facing us, these plans may
be the only hope we have
left.

Brexit policy: put any Brexit deal to a referendum against remain, with the Greens campaigning on a ‘remain in and reform the EU’
platform
Brexit policy: negotiate a credible leave deal that protects jobs and living standards within three months, and put it to a referendum against
remain in six months.
