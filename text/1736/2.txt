I'M SO PROUD
This week, I’m taking
a return to the earlier
editorials of this term,
and just giving a bit
of insight into the
experience of being
Editor and of being a
part of the wonderful
crazy world of Felix.
Yes, yes, I should write
something about the halls
rents. Especially given the
lowest-common-denom-
inator, pure sh*tpost that
is the front cover for this
week. I am become Buzz-
feed, destroyer of worlds.
Or, goodness forbid, am I
9Gag?
Look, I know. I’ll
save the proper editorial
for next week. Promise.
Don’t worry, it’ll be a
properly spicy take this
time. Or, at least, by my
pasty, genetically-weak
British self’s version of
spicy, which is maybe…
cinnamon? Ah, at least it’s
a Christmassy flavour.
Re-reading the above
paragraph, I’m pretty
sure this is where my
own personal psychotic
break begins. Dear Lord.
Through the fabric of
space and time itself, I
feel the collective eye
roll of you all tomorrow
as you realise it’s one
of those Editorials and
pre-emptively flick to the
centrefold.
Anyway – this week,
we present our first
56-page issue! I just
wanted to celebrate that
fact. For those of you who
read the Editorial, here’s
a little secret – next week
is going to blow it out of
the water, for the 70th
anniversary issue (which
will publish on the day
of the anniversary itself,
Monday the 9th, rather
than the usual Friday the
6th.) Don’t tell all those
people who don’t read my
ramblings. There’s a little
part of me that can’t wait
for the despairing cries of
Sudoku-starved Puzzles
fans when they realise the
paper hasn’t been distrib-
uted on Friday. They’ll
enjoy their Christmas
present from us, not to
worry.
Butthat’splanned!Fora
standard issue, 56 pages is
a lot. It’s a whole tonne of
content, and I don’t think
we’ve compromised on
quality one bit. Felix, both
in terms of the product
you see every week and
the society/organisation/
CULT that lies behind it,
is really coming together
this year after the rough
start we had. Sections
which were struggling
are now booming. It’s
discreetly been a personal
goal of mine to hit 56
pages without making any
special request of the team
for extra content, and the
beautiful bastards have
done it right at the end
of first term. I couldn’t
be happier or prouder
of them all. That’s the
Christmas present they’ve
given me.
Yes, it required another
all-nighter in the office.
Yes, I now know the cock-
roaches by name. Yes, I
am slowly growing roots
into the Editor’s chair and
am evolving in real-time
to sustain myself by
photosynthesis. Unfortu-
nately, the office is tucked
away in the basement.
Screw you, Darwin.
But none of that
matters! The sheer sat-
isfaction of realising we
were hitting that goal
earlier this week has
sustained me, like a great
white feasting on a kill,
such that I won’t need to
feed again for weeks. It’s
a huge personal milestone.
We’ve grown the Felix
teamtopossiblythelargest
it has ever been, and all of
them have been perform-
ing like stars. There are
those who get everything
sorted prematurely on
Monday, and who label
their files in the proper
format so everything is
nice and tidy to find later.
There are the night owls,
who are always racing
the time pressure at the
last second, but pull
through with some of the
best content we produce.
There are those who have
gone out of their way to
be there on a Thursday
night every week to help
me pull the last bits of the
paper together, even late
into the night. There are
the people who are always
willing to lend a hand,
even when I’m asking
them to do something
outside of their specific
remit. There are those who
bring snacks to the office,
or who make us laugh by
brainstorming Hangman,
or who keep an ear to the
ground and help me track
down stories.
You know them as the
X Editor, or perhaps even
as one of the invisible
copyeditors who do so
much every single week,
unacknowledged but for
the bottom right of this
page. I know them for all
the amazing things they
do that are nothing to do
with putting pen to paper,
but are fundamental to
what Felix really is – a bit
of a second home.
‘Cause I’m not really
growing roots or learn-
ing to telepathically
communicate with our
office roaches. I just feel
comfortable here. That’s
because of the people, the
team.
A’ight, that’s enough
for this week. Bit too
saccharin sweet. But just
one more time:
Hey, team.
Good bloody
job. Thanks
for coming in.
