P
rivate equity and
venture capital
both refer to
investments by
individuals or ﬁrms/
institutions in companies.
However, the scale of the
investment and the stage
of companies they invest
in differ.
Private Equity vs. Venture Capital: A closer look
hundred per cent of the
company, so it is not likely
that an individual would
be faced with a situation
that he/she is unable to
trade their shares on the
exchange, due to delisting
cause by private equity.
Some examples of
private equity are pension
funds like London CIV
(London Pension Collev-
tive Investment Vehicle)
and the private equity
divisions of Rothschild &
Co Merchant Banking.
Venture Capital
This refers to in-
vestment from ﬁrms or
wealthy individuals in
start-ups and small busi-
nesses. The investment
is not limited to ﬁnancial
capital (cash), it can also
be in a form of expertise,
technical and non-techni-
cal. The purpose of such
investments is to achieve
an unsually high rate of
return or ROI (Return on
Investment). This refers to
making signiﬁcantly more
money for every pound
invested. For example, if
you invested ﬁve pounds
in a company’s stock;
you would hope that your
ﬁve pounds becomes ﬁve
hundred pounds after
selling that stock. In the
case of expertise, it could
be seen as trading things
of signiﬁcant value to the
start-up or small business
in return for equity.
The risk in these
investments are signiﬁ-
cantly higher than private
equity, but the potential
upside could make such
investments more lucra-
tive. Imagine investing
in Google when it was a
start-up and owning ten
per cent of it. It wouldn’t
have cost over a thousand
dollars per share, like
it does now. This also
brings us to the point
that such investments
are cheaper compared to
private equity because
private equity refers to
investment in more estab-
lished companies.
Venture capital is
also an important part of
the start-up ecosystem
because the risk associat-
ed with a start-up is high
and thus makes it difﬁcult
for start-ups to obtain
loans and other debt in-
struments from traditional
banks. However, having
venture capital also in-
troduces the inﬂuence of
new shareholders to the
start-up, this may or may
not be desirable.
In the news: Female
Founders on the rise
There have been
concerns in the past
that most venture ﬁrms
knowing or unknowingly
fund a signiﬁcant majority
of starts-ups foundered
or co-foundered by men.
This has led to concerns
that there could be bias
against female founders.
However, in the recent
years, some funds has
made a move to fund
more female founders or
in some cases exclusively
female founders. And it
seems to be paying off.An
article in Forbes by Elana
Lyn Gross, titled “The

Private equity
You can think of it as
equity that is held pri-
vately, either by wealthy
individuals or ﬁrms.
Where equity refers to
shares/stocks and this
represents the ownership
of a company. These
investors would purchase
shares of privately held
companies or public com-
panies (companies traded
on the stock exchange).
The purpose of such in-
vestments is often to gain
control of a company or
companies and possibly
sell these investments at
a later stage. In the case
of public companies,
this might result in the
de-listing of the company
from the stock exchange.
De-listing refers to
removing the stock from
being publicly traded
on a stock exchange.
When this happens, the
delisted company would
be considered a private
company. What if I own
stock in the company that
is about to be delisted?
Well, private equity

In the news: The
Private Equity Rush
In a low interest rate
environment, investors
are constantly on the
lookout for opportunity
and investments. Might
private equity just be that
opportunity? An article
by Robin Wigglesworth,
titled “Investors pay up
to join the private equity
rush” by Robin Wiggles-
worth” in the Financial
Times, discusses these
funds attractiveness and
future downside to invest-
ing in them. He discusses
the political climate in
America and the poten-
tially lower returns in the
future due to high valua-
tions and other indicators.
In the news: Private
Equity about to screw
Non-profits?
It is no surprise that
private equity investment
has real societal impact
and this can be extended to
investments in general.An
article by Karl Bode, titled
“Private Equity Is Going
to Ruin the.Org Domain
System and Screw Non-
proﬁts” in VICE outlines
the concerns brought
about when the Public
Interest Registry (PIR)
announced it would be
bought by a private equity
ﬁrm. The PIR manages
the .org domain which is
used by non-proﬁts and
such a buyout could lead
to expensive .org domain
names for non-proﬁts.
