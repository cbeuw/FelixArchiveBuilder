A
t 60 universi-
ties across the
UK, university
staff who are
membersoftheUniversity
and College Union (UCU)
are currently staging an
eight-day walkout and
strike action in response
to the ongoing disputes
regarding pensions, pay,
and working conditions.
The Imperial branch
of the UCU, however, is
not striking – despite the
fact that 72% of ballot re-
spondents voted in favour
of taking action.
The culprit is the
Trade Union Act – or, as
Michael McGarvey, the
head of Imperial UCU,
puts it “the anti-Trade
Union Act” – introduced
by the Conservative
government in 2016 and
which came into force
in 2017. The legislation
makes it unlawful for any
trade union to take action
if the voter turnout does
not hit a threshold of 50%
- regardless of the support
for action amongst voters.
The Imperial UCU ballot
from the start of this year
only had a turnout of
47.99%, making it illegal
for them to take action
despite the 72% support
– a result that Michael
says had UCU members
“furious and incandes-
cent.”
The actions follow
from the strike action
regarding USS pension
schemes in 2018, after a
proposed shift to a less
secure model, which
caused disruption to
Imperial students as
contact hours were can-
celled. The strikes now
are due to disputes over
both the pension scheme
– which has proposed
a rise in contribution of
each member’s salary to
9.6% - as well as over pay
and working conditions.
The concerns around
working conditions are
predominantly to do with
exploitation of staff. Many
postdoctoral or teaching
fellow staff – particularly
those on ‘precarious’, or
fixed-term rather than
permanent, contracts do
not have provision for
many parts of the work
they end up doing. Many
research grants do not,
for example, contain pay
allowance for teaching
duties – but many staff
end up taking on those
duties ‘for free’ anyway,
in an effort to build CVs,
which mainly benefits
the university. At the
senior level, professors
are often left feeling like
their job descriptions are
too open-ended, meaning
extra work often gets
added into their respon-
sibilities on an informal
basis that accumulates
over time until it is un-
manageable.
Chris Jackson, a
member of the UCU
and Professor of Earth
Sciences, expanded:
“Concerns related to
overwork must be consid-
ered in the context of pay.
If you get paid £200,000
a year to work 12 hours
a day in the City, perhaps
you can reconcile this
sort of thing. But if your
salary is low and if this
makes living in London
difficult, people rightly
feel unhappy, exploited
and undervalued. Being
overworked and overpaid
is an issue at all career
stages, although some
senior management are
on six-figure salaries such
that they are not exposed
to this so much.”
The Imperial UCU
balloted only on the
issue of pensions at the
start of the year, rather
than on pensions and
pay like many other
UCU branches, because
Imperial College man-
agement seceded from
national negotiations on
pay fourteen years ago.
This means that Imperial
staff negotiate their pay
directly with the College,
rather than in the nation-
al-level negotiations that
affect pay scales for most
researchers and lecturers
in the UK.
Typically, negotiations
about pay are carried out,
and at the end an offer
is presented to the Joint
Trades Unions, comprised
of the UCU as well as
UNISON and Unite, who
represent other groups of
staff at the College. This
year, the offer was an
increase of 2% for salaries
overall, representing a
£600-1400 award for in-
dividuals. The unions can
then decide whether to
accept or reject the offer;
in the latter case, as was
the case this year, typi-
cally negotiations would
reopen – or alternatively,
the College has the power
to simply impose the offer
as it stands.
This year, neither
occurred. After the re-
jection, the College put
together four alternate
options instead – each
with the same 2% total
increase, but distribut-
ed differently among
different pay scales –
which were all in turn
rejected again. However,
according to a College
spokesperson, UNISON
and Unite indicated an
“informal preference” for
one of the options if any
were to be imposed. The
College then decided to
impose that option rather
than open negotiations
again.
From the UCU per-
spective, Michael says,
this imposed scheme was
worse than the original
proposal, as it left many
UCU members with a pay
increase below the rate of
inflation – which in real
terms is equivalent to a
pay cut.
Additionally, the offer
was imposed at a time
when it was too late for
ballots to be completed
before October. However,
there is a possibility of
conducting another ballot
vote on both the pay and
pension issues now that
they have been estab-
lished – and that is the
option the Imperial UCU
has taken, serving notice
to College of that fact on
Tuesday 26th and opening
the new ballot next week.
“If management take
the high-handed approach
that they can ignore agreed
procedures, can rip-up
regulations and do so in
a totally irresponsible
fashion, then people have
to say something about
it. I don’t know if they
weren’t thinking about
their actions or if it was
just incompetence. Maybe
both. I’m almost speech-
less trying to rationalise
why they have done this,”
he said.
Chris further ques-
tioned the conviction of
College management to
make meaningful change
to pay and workload:
“We staff understand
there are external market
forces at play that con-
strain finances. However,
college management need
to recognise that it is us,
the students and staff, that
have built and sustain the
college’s reputation. In
that sense, we should be
valued more than it has
felt during the last years.
Warm words in college
communications are not
enough; we need to see
change that is consistent
with our collective morals
and ethics. We are a
zombie institution being
bullied by external forces;
we have autonomy and
agency due to the relative-
ly strong financial position
we have collectively put
the college in.”
When asked about the
reason for the insufficient
turnout, Michael sug-
gested that it might be to
the ballot being held at
the same time as people
were getting to grips with
beginning of the academic
year or that the first ballot
was specifically about
pensions and did not
include pay disputes.
“Pensions are a part of
your remuneration – and it
being massively attacked
by the USS executive is a
reduction to the remuner-
ation package you receive
overall. But you don’t get
it at the outset; it’s long-
term, depending on where
in your career you are,
whereas pay is more im-
mediate.We’re hoping that
will galvanise members,
and will be campaigning
for higher turnout and
a vote for action in the
second ballot.”
Chris added further
context from his per-
spective around working
conditions: “Many people
don’t strike, or didn’t
vote to strike, because
they’re ironically too
busy and/or can’t afford
to lose eight days of pay.
They don’t feel they have
the financial security,
and feel threatened and
precarious – what if your
bosses action against you
whilst away or when you
get back? Academia is
so hard to get into, so
competitive, that manage-
ment essentially have a
captive audience that they
can treat poorly without
repercussion. There needs
to be humanity in their
treatment of staff. They
were lecturers once, so
they should understand.”
