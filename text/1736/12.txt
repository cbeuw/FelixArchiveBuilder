T
he United States
of America has
had a signiﬁcant
presence in the
Middle East, a region so
far away from it. Why?
The reason is the preser-
vation of the Petrodollar
system, the currency in
which most oil is traded.
The demise of this system
would bring about a colos-
sal powershift from West
to East: potentially crash-
ing oil prices, currency
values, and stock prices,
eclipsing the 1930’s Wall
Street crash and 2008
Financial Crisis. Not only
would it shift the world’s
ﬁnancial epicentre, it
would impact basic social
values such as freedom of
speech and press. What
could trigger this crash?
The principal adversary
of the Petrodollar system
is Chinese President Xi
Jinping, who is bidding
to boost his country’s
dominance on the world
stage and repealing the
economic slowdown that
China faces. A change in
Washington’s strategy in
the Middle East and new
investments by Beijing
can potentially trigger a
powershift in this region
and possibly the world.
The Petrodollar system
was born in 1973, at
a time when oil prices
and inﬂation were rising
rapidly in the US due to
increasing debt caused
partially by the Vietnam
war, increased domestic
spending and a govern-
ment deﬁcit. To prevent
a potential collapse of
the dollar, the Nixon gov-
ernment decided to end
the convertibility of the
US dollar into gold, thus
A primary example is
Nazi Germany, a country
that lacked natural oil
resources and was forced
into producing synthetic
oil from coal, a very
expensive process. The
extensive availability of
oil to the Allied Forces
and the lack of availa-
bility of oil for the Axis
Powers arguably resulted
in the eventual British and
American victory over
Nazi Germany in World
War 2. For the Peoples
Republic of China, the
availability and leverage
over the oil economy is
crucial in its ambitions
to become a Global
Superpower. Currently
China is the world’s
biggest coal user (using
more coal than the rest of
the world combined) and
now, the world’s biggest
oil importer (see graph).
Consequently, this leaves
the country in a very vul-
nerable position – clearly
seen as 80% of Chinese
debt is denominated in
US dollars. Moreover,
the US dominance in
Middle East puts Chinese
trade at risk. China is
in a very weak position Graph of crude oil imports in China, India, and US // Oil 2018 Report
making the US Dollar the
world’s ﬁrst modern ﬁdu-
ciary currency. In 1974,
the American government
signed a bilateral agree-
ment with Saudi Arabia
stating that all oil would
be sold in dollars, and in
return, the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia gained US
military protection and
assistance. Under Saudi
inﬂuence, other countries
in the Organization of Pe-
troleum Exporting Coun-
tries (OPEC) also agreed
to sell oil in dollars. This
was a time when OPEC
countries were keen on
US protection, due to
Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan and the fall
of the Iranian Shah. Thus,
the Petrodollar system
came to life.
OPEC countries gain
many beneﬁts from
trading with the Petrodol-
lar system, such as being
able to invest in secure
American investments
rather than volatile local
projects. Even more bene-
ﬁcial for the United States
is the extra liquidity and
foreign capital given to its
ﬁnancial markets - known
as Petrodollar recycling.
These recycled dollars
keep interest rates low
and promotes inﬂation
free growth by effectively
allowing the US to borrow
its own money. This
system has made the US
dollar the world’s global
reserve currency, with
over2/3ofglobalcurrency
reserves in dollars and
over 40% of global debt
being in dollars. This
status enables the US
to be a global economic
hegemony and the world’s
only superpower.
Availability and
leverage of natural re-
sources – especially oil
– is incredibly important
for a nation and can be
seen throughout history.
Oil Currencies: The Fight for Global Dominance
The Petrodollar system, whereby oil from OPECs are traded only in US Dollars, holds the key to American global
dominance. China is trying to change that.
