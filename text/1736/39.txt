T
he old adage
“Do not place
all your eggs in
one basket” is
probably one of the most
important things to re-
member when investing.

systematic and non-sys-
tematic risks.
Systematic vs
Non-Systematic Risk
Non-Systematic risk is
commonly referred to as
company-speciﬁc risks
(e.g. when the company
misses its quarterly
earnings target, company
in ﬁnancial distress etc.).
These events do not affect
the market on the whole.
Imagine that you invested
100% of your funds into
1 stock, your gains and
losses are solely depend-
ent on the performance of
the company.
Systematic risk is
commonly referred to as
market risk (e.g. reces-
sions, changes in interest
rates, political unrest).
These events affect the
overall performance of the
ﬁnancial markets. Now
imagine that you invested
your funds equally into
10 stocks instead, when
there is negative compa-
ny-speciﬁc news on one
of the stocks, only a small
portion of your portfolio
is affected.
2 portfolios to consider
When constructing
the optimal portfolio, we
are trying to eliminate
the non-systematic risks
through asset diversi-
ﬁcation. Note that it is
impossible to diversify
away the systematic risks.
As you can see from
the graph below, as the
number of ﬁrms increas-
es, the non-systematic
risk decreases and tends
towards 0, leaving only
the systematic risk.
From the earlier
example, if you invested
your funds equally into
10 stocks and there is
negative company-spe-
ciﬁc news on one of the
stocks, only 10% of your
stock portfolio is affected,
the other 90% will remain
untouched. If we extrap-

have the urge to allocate
more of their funds into it,
hoping to generate even
higher absolute returns.
However, it could very
well go south the next day.
There are many ﬁnan-
cial instruments such as
stocks, bonds, Indexes,
exchange-traded funds
(ETF), commodities and
real estate investment
trusts available to inves-
tors.
For this article, I will be
focusing on diversifying
a portfolio consisting of
stocks and bonds as it is
more commonly accessi-
ble for retail investors.
Stocks represents the
company that you buy
shares in. A company
offers its shares to inves-
tors to raise money to grow
its business or acquire
new assets and when you
buy a company’s shares,
you become a shareholder
of the company. Its share
price will also ﬂuctuate
depending on economic,
industry/company speciﬁc
events.
In ﬁnance, we divide
these risks (unexpected

olate this portfolio to
500 stocks, similar to the
S&P500, we are able to
completely eliminate all
non-systematic risks.
So you might ask,
if diversiﬁcation is so
important, why shouldn’t
I just invest in an index
such as the S&P500?
This strategy is indeed
highly favoured by
passive investors as they
only need to monitor the
macroeconomic perfor-
mance of the country
and global economy
rather than monitoring
each stock individually.
Investors are not able
to directly invest in the
S&P500 but rather invest
through an Exchange
Traded Fund (ETF).
ETFs are just a basket of
securities that tracks an
underlying index and is
traded on an exchange.
One common ETF that
tracks the S&P500 is
(NYSEARCA:SPY). By
buying into this ETF, you
expose yourself to the 500
companies that comprises
the S&P500, therefore
diversifying away all
non-systematic risks.
For investors that are
looking for returns above
the market (S&P500),
they should split their
optimal portfolio into an
active and passive portfo-
lio, whereby the passive
portfolio consists of
ETFs, bonds and treasury
notes. The active portion
consists of stocks that they
have individually picked.
If executed properly,
the active portion of the
portfolio will be able to
generate much higher
returns and increase the
overallreturnsoftheentire
portfolio. As with any
form of active investing,
due diligence is required
to analyse the individual
companies before buying
into them.
Role of Bonds
Bonds serve as a hedge
to your stock portfolio and
investors consider bonds
a safe haven. When the
market is showing signs of
weakness, investors ﬂock
to bonds and this is known
as a “ﬂight to safety”. This
increase in demand pushes
the bond prices upwards,
offsetting the losses in
your stock portfolio. As a
retail investor, it is recom-
mended to only purchase
investment grade bonds,
BBB rated and above.
Investors are to monitor
for interest rate risks,
such as when the central
banks increase interest
rates. This means that
other investors are able
to seek higher returns in
the market than what your
bond can offer, therefore
lowering the price of your
bond.
Together, the active
portfolio, passive port-
folio and bond portfolio
provides a good starting
point from which you
can explore the different
strategies to manage the
risks and maximise your
reward-to-risk ratio.
