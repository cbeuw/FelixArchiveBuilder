straw but made of pasta.
It is fantastic as a pasta
and an absolute joy to eat.
Don’t believe me? Alex
Delany from Bon Appetit
Magazine wrote an article
titled “Bucatini Is the Best
Long Pasta There Ever
Was or Will Be”.
Best served with:
Thinner sauces with
strong flavours like
tomato or squid ink. More
important than ever to
finish your pasta in the
sauce so it can soak up all
that flavour into its hole.

Trofie, Gemelli,
Casarecce
Our short little twists
and turns. Trofie is the
rustic, hand-smudged
pasta twist that fusilli
wishes it was. Gemelli
means twins and is made
from two entwined
strands. Cute. Casarecce
are like little scrolls. Also
cute.
Best served with: Not
a whole lot of surface
area means it can’t really
handle a lot of sauces
particularly well. Pesto
The Ultimate(?) Guide to Pasta Shapes
There is one universal constant, a single unifying language that connects
generations, crosses borders, and is an immediate friend to all who
encounter it. No, it’s not maths (sorry Galileo, but you were wrong) or even
music, but the gastronomical miracle that is pasta. Here is a guide to some
exciting shapes to spice up your pantry and reignite your passion for a food
that can sometimes get a little, dare I say it, dry.

S
imultaneously a
destitute student’s
staple and a fea-
ture in high-end
restaurants, everyone un-
derstands pasta and, more
importantly, everyone
loves pasta.
However, even true
love can get boring.
Missionary and “words
of affirmation” can only
keep a relationship alive
for so long. Likewise,
fusilli and spaghetti are
bound to grow tiresome
at some point. But worry
not, our Ultimate(?)
Guide to Pasta Shapes
is here to save you from
the culinary equivalent
of a stale marriage. Take
it from someone who
knows: loyalty is dead,
long live variety.
We’velimitedourselves
to unfilled, dried pastas.
Filled and fresh pasta are
a whole different game
and we don’t have the
time nor the page numbers
to dedicate to them. Sim-
ilarly, wholegrain and
gluten-free options are
available but they’re inde-
fensibly gross and we’re
not here for indefensibly
gross (apologies to the
coeliac community in
advance).
Spaghetti
Round, slurpable
lengths of romance (think
Lady and the Tramp).
What’s not to love? To
the people who snap their
spaghetti in half before
cooking, there’s a special
place in hell for you.
Best served with:
Loose, smooth sauces that
can coat each strand and
doesn’t get in the way of
the slurp. Think carbonara
or tomato-based sauces.
Surprisingly, meaty
sauces like bolognese
aren’t a great fit but no
one will be mad at you
for doing it. Sometimes
tradition trumps sense.
Capellini
Spaghetti’s trendy,
skinnier cousin. Has a twin
sister, capelli d’angelo,
which is somehow even
skinnier. Like lots of
skinny people (I’m talking
about myself really),
prone to breaking and
absurdly difficult to dress.
I tend to avoid because
chonky bois with nonno
pappardelle leading the
charge as the widest of
them all. Apart from pur-
ported places of origins,
the differences between
them vary by source so
don’t stress the small stuff
and go for the thiccness
you know you deserve.
Best served with:
Sauces that are rich and
meaty, like the man of
your dreams. Or cheesy
and creamy. The man of
your dreams comparison
still stands.
Bucatini
Good lord, what have
they done? It’s spaghetti
but with a hole going
down the middle. It’s a
choice. But look a bit
closer at the intricate
ridges running along
the short tubes and that
oblique cut and you might
begin to understand why
it’s such a popular work-
horse pasta. It was almost
designed for success.
Best served with: The
ridges ensure even thick
sauces can cling onto its
Like the Argentine
comic by Quino, Mafalda,
Mafalde comes in strips.
Unlike the Argentine
comic by Quino, Mafalda,
Mafalde looks like the
beautiful tentacles you
may find dragging behind
a portugese man of war.
When cooked right, you
get the contrast between
the delicate frilled edges
and the sturdier central
spine. Basically fettucine
in a tutu.

it’s too reminiscent of rice
vermicelli and then I just
want a sizzling hot plate
of Singapore noodles.
Best served with: Very
light, oil-based sauces like
aglio e olio or even in a
soup preparation.
Linguine
A personal favourite,
linguine is what happens
if spaghetti and tagliatelle
had a child. A best-of-
//Popo le Chien
both-worlds, it has the heft
for heavier sauces but also
the elegance of spaghetti
(re: Lady and the Tramp).
Best served with:
Creamy sauces, chunkier
meat sauces, light and
aromatic sauces… I mean,
what can’t you pair it
with?
Tagliatelle, Fettucine,
Pappardelle
Tagliatelle, fettuccine,
pappardelle. These are our

curved surfaces and the
tube shape is great for
collecting up bits of finely
cut veg. Pasta salad is an
obvious choice.
Mafalde
//Popo le Chien
Best served with: a
medium weight sauce can
show off the versatility of
this pasta. Another case
of centering the sauce
around the playful texture
of the pasta.
Fusilli
It exists and I know
some people love it. Does
it excite me? Not really.
Although the tricolore
variety can be fun.
Best served with: A
pasta bake? That sounds
about right.
