“A future
where we’re
connected
without
looking
down at our
smartphones”
E
veryone’s heard
of artificial
i n t e l l i g e n c e ,
more commonly
known asAI, but have you
heard of intelligence aug-
mentation, or IA? No, it’s
not an illegal substance
that alters your thinking
capabilities to make you
highly intelligent; though,
it does come close!
IA is closely linked
with AI, but it takes a
backseat in making de-
cisions for you; to put it
simply, with IA, you’re
at the wheel. Intelligence
augmentation systems
analyse information and
present it for your consid-
eration. And, no, it’s not
capable of ‘taking over
the world.’ To think of it,
IA plays more of an as-
sistant-like role, focused
on helping humans rather
than automating tasks to
effectively replace human
intervention.
Shifting to augmented
reality, or AR, it made a
surprising comeback over
a year ago and looks to
be a way we interact with
technology as we head
into the future. Some may
confuse virtual reality
with augmented reality;
virtual reality, commonly
known as VR, places
you in virtually created
environments where
you interact with virtual
entities. In contrary, as
you might have already
seen through your
as well as additions to it.
Even Peter Parker, for
that matter, used the same
approach for creating his
suit in the recent “Spider-
man: Far From Home”.
The only exception is
that instead of using holo-
grams as an interface, AR
headsets or smartphones
are used. Soon, in the next
few years, the technology
behind AR may make
its way into our normal,
everyday glasses.
Now, combine the two,
and think of the amazing,
revolutionary product
formed, at least in theory
or imagination. Well,
honestly, I think it’s the
perfect combination in
terms of its wide array of
practical use cases. It’s no
wonder why the industry
is shifting towards aug-
mented reality oriented
technologies, especially
on the manufacturing
and business side of
things. From Microsoft’s
HoloLens 2 and Google’s
Glass Enterprise Edition
2 to Apple’s rumoured,
upcoming AR glasses, it’s
easy to observe a pattern:
companies are creating
more personal devices.
What started with laptops
and smartphones is now
slowly moving on to our
wrists in theformof fitness
trackers and smart-watch-
es. Looks like the step
after that is integrating the
same technology found
in smartphones as well
as smartwatches into our
glasses!
Need another example?
Again, coming back to
Iron Man and his infamous
suit of armour, think of
the heads up display he
uses to analyse and gain
a better understanding of
his environment as well
as on the state of his suit.
Alternatively, you could
consider the glasses worn
by secret agents in the
movie “Kingsman: Secret
Service” and “Kingsman:
Golden circle,” which
serve to provide a means
of communicating with
other agents and acess
to essential information.
In general, the notion of
combining AR and IA
has existed in the context
of films, video games,
books, and series for a
long time. Heads up
displays are especially
used a lot in games, where
information regarding
a player’s environment
and statistics are vital to
completing the game.
Imagine completing
Minecraft without health
and hunger bars or even
playing a game of com-
petitive CS:GO without
a mini-map. Games such
as Pokemon Go and
Minecraft Earth have
shown the potential of AR
in creating a interactive,
immersive real-world
experience; however, the
software, or hardware for
that matter, isn’t optimal
for a seamless user expe-
rience when considering
it as a general, standalone
platform.
Currently, Google’s and
Microsoft’s implementa-
tions of this set of devices,
as previously mentioned,
are mainly geared towards
improving productivity in
the business and manu-
facturing segments. This
could be thought of as a
‘testing ground’ to tune
the product. However, its
use in the business space is
not to deny that it can’t be
used from a commercial
standpoint; rather, it’s a
matter of picking the right
time. Building third-party
support is key for the
sustenance and popularity
of this product in the com-
mercial space. In addition,
the quality of the product
and the services it offers
makes or breaks the deal
for consumers.
It’s often amazing to
visualise a future where
we would be constantly
connected with the world
without having to look
down at our smartphones.
Imagine the most general
use cases where virtual
arrows help guide your
way to a destination or
even show you health
statistics, time, weather,
and even notifications on
a virtual sidebar! It’s great
to witness the actual de-
velopment of technology
that are commonplace in
fictional environments.
More than that, it’s truly a
great and exciting time for
the tech space.
“IA plays
more of an
assistant like
role, focused
on helping
humans”
smartphones, AR adds,
(rather projects overlays
of) virtual elements
to the actual, physical
world around you. Need
an example of how this
would pan out in the near
future? Look no further
than the holographic
projections used by Iron
Man to create his suit,
