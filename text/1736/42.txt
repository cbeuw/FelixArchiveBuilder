I
know what you’re
thinking - another
day, another Brexit
article. But if you’re
anything like us and have
the travel bug, then you’re
going to want to read this
one. With Brexit being
delayed once again to
January at the soonest,
there’s no better time to
grab a bargain and finally
book flights to those
European destinations
you’ve always wanted to
go to.
Flights with airlines
like Ryanair and easyJet
have been able to stay rea-
sonably priced due to the
“open skies” arrangement
within the EU. Leaving
with no deal means the
UK will need to reach
a similar agreement to
maintain these low fares,
otherwise we could be hit
with fewer flight routes
and more expensive
journeys.
If we end up leaving
the EU with no deal at
all, be prepared for longer
queues, more customs
checks and stamps all
over your passports.
Although we still have
our “no deal contingency
plan” to fall back on
for about 12 months,
officials at Brussels have
confirmed the return of
stricter border checks in
the event of a no-deal
Brexit. British nationals
can also be subject to
more rigorous questioning
at borders, and can be
required to provide exten-
sive information on their
visits and stays in EU
countries. There has been
conjecture over whether
we will need a European
Travel Information and
Authorisation Scheme
(ETIAS) document to
travel around Europe, but
most officials have agreed
that even if needed, that
won’t come into effect
until at least 2021.
It’s not all bad news
though - UK nationals
will still reserve the right
to visa-free travel for
short stays in the EU (up
to 90 days), as long as the
UK gives EU citizens the
same rights. British travel-
lers could also potentially
get to claim VAT refund
on goods purchased in EU
countries as well.
What about staying
safe whilst abroad, you
ask? UK nationals could
lose their right to health-
care access through the
European health insur-
ance card unless a deal
is agreed upon, meaning
not only will you have to
pay for treatment abroad,
but you could potentially
need to wait longer to be
seen in emergency situa-
tions. You might also lose
your right to roaming-free
mobile phone use, and
we might end up having
to pay overseas mobile
charges when using
our phones in Europe,
however, some mobile
providers have promised
to keep European mobile
prices in line with prices
here at home.
One thing we all love
about going abroad is how
much cheaper food and
accommodation usually is
(okay fine, Paris doesn’t
really count here) – that
might be about to change.
It is speculated that due
to the lack of economic
security following
Brexit, the value of the
British pound has been
steadily dropping, making
exchange rates worse
for travellers - meaning
everything suddenly
seems more expensive,
and our pounds no longer
stretch as far as they used
to. The pound still remains
fairly strong against
currencies like the Polish
zloty though, so why not
book yourself a holiday to
Kraków soon?
