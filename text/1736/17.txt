The Felix Mock Election: Have Your Say!
How left- or right-wing is the Felix readership actually? Does the Felix readership support Remain or
Leave? And do these answers differ across faculties, gender, age, party?
We want to know! Follow the link or use the QR code below to take part in the Felix Mock Election!
And don’t worry - it’s completely anonymous.
In the final issue of term (right before the actual general election) we’ll publish the results. And when
Felix is back in January, we’ll publish an analysis of how the Felix mock election compared to national
polling and demographic data.
