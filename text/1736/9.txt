I
t’s the most wonder-
ful time of the year…
for the big fat cats
to cash in on your
appetite for greed and low
self-esteem. Christmas
is around the corner, and
the capitalist gods have
sent their finest to wring
out every ounce of self-re-
spect we have: Black
Friday. Since its begin-
nings in mid-20th century
America, Black Friday has
evolved to summarise the
disheartening toxicity of
human nature. This year,
I would like to invite you
all to reconsider the whole
affair.
The only sale you
should concern yourself
with is the sale of your
soul when you subscribe
to the cancerous rhetoric
of Black Friday. With
the aggressive mar-
keting on all forms of
media it’s hard to keep
your head screwed on
straight. We’re being
waterboarded with the
latest must have deals
and offers that nobody
asked for - but look!
They have 50% off a
retail price that was
70% overpriced anyway.
Wonderful. 30% off on
some shoes made by thir-
teen-year olds in sweat-
shops? Awesome. The
Communist Manifesto
in a festive hardcover
limited edition? Exactly
what I wanted, Mom! A
perfect marriage of my
privileged upbringing
and socialist views. It’s
a consume-as-much-as-
you-can campaign, and
they plan to force feed
us until we drop dead.
The blackest aspect
of Black Friday is its
rotting heart. My mind
is already exhausted by
the mental bludgeoning
from the sadomasochis-
tic relationship I have
with the retail industry,
and the shopping season
has only just started.
They’re selling us the
coffin and charging for
the labour to nail it shut.
It’s going to be a bleak
couple of weeks for the
sane.
Festivities have
always had a cynical
scent in the air. Now
more than ever, the
preconditioned idea that
we need material goods
to feel good and to
feel accepted by others
is deeply depressing.
Black Friday is merely
the looking-glass that
allows us to see the
disgusting nature of
humans. This is not an
attack on what people do
with their money, rather
on the whole attitude
and culture of material-
ism that slowly degrades
morale and self-worth.
The need for stuff is
preconditioned; the idea
that the objects we own
determine our value
is ingrained into our
collective conscience.
It feels good to have
things - at the time, at
least. The emptiness and
regret come later: these
worldly collections of
atoms aren’t necessar-
ily the answers to your
problems. Be measured
in your overindulgence,
before you get over-
whelmed by it all.
I urge you not to spend
your dollars on more
glorified doorstops,
but to spend your short
time on Earth with your
loved ones; treat them to
a square meal, take them
skydiving or to a pottery
class. Money spent
on experiences makes
you far happier than
money spent on physical
objects. The bombard-
ment of consumerist
pornography on sight
at every junction in our
busy lives gives us a
chance to reflect on the
environmental, social,
and personal impact it
all has. Whatever the
latest offer is, know that
even the best recreation-
al drugs have a come
down.

nail it shut.”
