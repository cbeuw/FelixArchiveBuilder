Top 10 Rap Albums of 2019
With the end of the year approaching, Hip Hop Soc President Asad Raja takes us through his picks for 2019’s top
rap projects. The list highlights the strides made in UK rap this year.

S
traight up: the
UK killed it this
year. We’ve ﬁnally
reached a point
where the best outputs of
the rap scene at home is
legitimately comparable
to the best of the US’s.
Asides from the four
banging albums that make
this top 10 list, this year
saw the release of great
UK projects like Kojey
Radical’sCashmereTears,
Dave’s Psychodrama,
Digga D’s Double Tap
Diaries, Headie One’s
Music x Road (and of
course, high expectations
for Stormzy’s upcoming
Heavy Is The Head too).
The US on the other hand
was quieter this year, fol-
lowing a stellar 2018.
10. Diaspora -
Goldlink
This album, though
not Goldlink’s best, was
a refreshing balance
of high-energy, atten-
tion-grabbing, and unde-
niably groovy. Props must
be given to some on-point
features that each seemed
to bring an appropriate
reaction out of Goldlink
– from his brooding bars
coupled with Khalid’s
delicate hook on ‘Days
Like This’ to his mean de-
meanour following Pusha
T’s bodying of the beat on
‘Cokewhite’ (can’t wait
for that collab album).
9. uknowhatimsayin¿
- Danny Brown
uknowhatimsayin¿ is
probably Danny Brown’s
least manic-sounding
project. He chooses to
replace that aesthetic
with a certain shininess
– something between a
light-hearted disposition
and grounded self-ob-
servation. Short songs
with distinct, albeit less
experimental than typical,
production coupled with
Danny’s unique, catchy
ﬂows and personali-
ty-ﬁlled bars make this a
pretty sweet project, easy
to listen to in one sitting.
8. So Much Fun -
Young Thug
Thugger came through
with yet another great
project to add to his
catalogue this year. Aptly
named, So Much Fun
feels lively, loose and lit.
Thug ﬁlls a good number
of tracks here with
straight bars too, without
slacking on the incredible
cadences, creative adlibs
and catchy hooks he has
come to be known for.
Almost all the features
sound brilliant too, each
of them perfectly comple-
menting the production,
and Thug’s chosen vocal
styling. ‘Big Tipper’,
featuring Thugger’s rising
star signee Lil Keed, and
the wavy, hypnotising
‘Lil Baby’ are two of my
favourite tracks.
7. Nothing Great
About Britain - Slowthai
Following Slowthai’s
trail of singles since 2016,
a couple of which appear
on this album, Nothing
Great About Britain seems
that bit more purposeful.
Where he could very
easily have made a full
body of work in line with
the hazy, depressive, lo-ﬁ,
pill-popping midlands rap
scene vibe heard on these
singles, Slowthai chose
to channel his inherent
charisma into a project
that is both clashingly
anarchist and crushingly
vulnerable. There hasn’t
before been a project from
the UK scene quite like it,
most likely because there
hasn’t before been a time
in Britain like now.
6. All My Heroes Are
Cornballs - JPEGMAFIA
On All My Heroes
Are Cornballs, PEGGY
responds to the experi-
ence of fame through a
now well-established lens
of aggression mixed with
nihilism. PEGGY uses
his new vantage point to
further confront and inter-
rogate archetypes in the
weird modern cesspool of
shallow thots and rappers,
music industry soul-suck-
ers, brazen bigots, and
internet-dwelling, pseu-
do-liberal closet-racists
and quasi-incels. Through
this all, PEGGY grapples
with his own identity over
captivatingly unpredict-
able instrumentals – his
proximity with all these
groups seems to make
him paranoid of losing the
ability to self-deﬁne.
5. Hoodies All
Summer - Kano
It makes me mad how
slept on Kano is in general
(“oh you mean Sully from
Top Boy”), but this album
was particularly over-
looked considering how
great it is. The veteran
wisdom on this album is
absolutely golden, and
the immersive orchestral
instrumentation that it’s
wrapped in makes for
an amazing, and very
coherent, project. Kano’s
observation of the youths
cut from the same cloth
he’s grown from allows
him to lend mature, ac-
quainted insight, without
coming off as preachy.
4. Ignorance is Bliss -
Skepta
This album is just so
hard. Front to back, the
beats are captivatingly
icy, mean, and electron-
ic – static-ﬁlled bass,
tapping synths, and
minimalistic melodies
that swell under Skepta’s
heavy, pronounced
delivery make the project
aesthetically brilliant. The
content follows a tight,
neat arc too – from cold to
intense to vicious.
3. Bandana - Freddie
Gibbs and Madlib
Madlib and Freddie
Gibbs reuniting was
bound to produce some-
thing as good as this, their
previous collaborative
output, Pinata, proving
their insane compatibil-
ity. Again, soul and jazz
sampling beats provide a
back bone for tracks that
are anywhere between
gritty, dream-like, or
sombre, with Freddie
delivering conﬁdent, in-
sightful, story-telling bars
that are able to go each
way. Freddie’s ability to
move from the personal
to the general in his ann-
ecdotal and observational
lyrics is compounded by
an increased focus on
black identity’s strife.
2. IGOR - Tyler, the
Creator
Tyler has always had a
tendency towards concept
albums. Though the
blonde wig, sunglasses,
and pastel suit rocking
character IGOR represents
was given, on the surface,
less exposition than char-
acters from his previous
albums, the album’s
nuanced thematic focus
on obsessiveness paints
the concept vibrantly. The
project details the ability
of infatuation to trans-
form us into inarticulate
puppets – both sonically
and lyrically presenting
the ugliness and the
heart-harnessing of it in
a rich, painfully honest
manner.
1. GREY Area - Little
Simz
This might be my
favourite album to have
ever come out of the
UK rap scene. Young,
independent and accom-
plished, Little Simz’s
position as one of hip
hop’s living legends has
been solidiﬁed by this
project. Every track is so
thorough: not a minute
goes by where it’s difﬁ-
cult to be impressed. The
instrumentals, which have
a very beautiful, organic
quality, perfectly comple-
ment Simz’ gorgeous, di-
vulging, poetic lyrics. The
emotions are emphatic
but subtle, far ranging,
and highly mature. Simz
provides a lot of food
for thought throughout
the album, accenting
them with the last track
‘Flowers’, a ﬂawless full
stop to the journey.
