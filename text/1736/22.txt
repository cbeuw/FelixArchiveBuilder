‘Used to Be Lonely’ is keeping me company
T
his summer
Whitney released
their second
album – Forever
Turned Around. A beau-
tifully intimate project
focusing on change in
personal relationships.
It’s definitely an album
for the summer, but I
believe Forever Turned
Around is just as great at
warming the spirit in the
cold winter months. It’s
the musical equivalent
of mulled cider. For now,
I’m just going to ramble
about my favourite track
on the album - “Used
to be Lonely” - because
of its interesting use of
lyrical and compositional
storytelling.
The lyrics very brieﬂy
touch on well-known
love song tropes. When I
say ‘very brieﬂy’ I’m not
being hyperbolic, eight
lines in two verses and
only four different words
in the chorus (you should
be able to figure them out).
The few words chosen
give light to the ideas of
finally understanding love
and having a partner in
your corner.
When long days knock
you down
When cold winds turn me
round
Take me out in to the night
Cause the only way to
spend our time
Used to be lonely
Lonely
On paper the lyrics are
somewhat depressing,
yearning for love. To
further twist expectations,
the initial chord progres-
sion gives the impression
of a desperately sad song.
However, this is no sad
tale of love loss but rather
that of love gain.
Because we’re in the
past tense we know that
the lyrics are describing
the transition into some-
thing better. So, the focus
on feeling alone doesn’t
lower the mood horrifical-
ly. This, combined with
a counter narration using
melody and instrumenta-
tion ﬂips the feeling of the
song on its head.
Whitney are fantastic
at using an ensemble
of guitars, percussion
and a side serving of
brass to give you that
dewy-gooey-goodness
country songs are known
for. As the layers of
softly played instruments
partner-up, a warm fuzzy
feeling begins to fill your
chest. It’s the growing of
new love from the ashes.
It’s musical context and
intelligent storytelling.
Four words in a chorus
is all it’s taken Whitney
to capture a moment of
joyous entanglement. A
celebration of a new era in
a life by acknowledging
the previous one.
The music video helps
reinforce these themes
of transition from being
alone to being in a rela-
tionship. Also, it’s a really
cute video so you should
definitely check it out.
There’s plenty more
months to go until the
dark blanket of winter lets
up, and with albums like
this by my side hopefully
getting through it will be
easier.
Two new tunes for you
L
ast month LA
based Funk
group The
Pendletons re-
leased their debut LP: 2
Steps Away. A delightful
blend of tight grooves,
thick bass and slick
70’s-style horn sections.
The record as a whole
draws heavily on its funk
and disco influences,
with a distrincly vintage
compositional style, still
taking advantage of the
possibilities of modern
production, making it
occasionally chorus and
ﬂange, a rawer tone would
be far more listenable.
Overall ‘Priceless’ is an
impressive debut, easily
holding its own against
high rotation club tracks,
demanding a listen, and a
place on your pre-drinks
playlist.

Life to Me
‘Priceless’ is the debut
track from Liam Joshua
Eede or LJ. The North-
ampton based singer lists
inﬂuences including Craig
David and Chris Brown,
this comes through loud
and clear on the hook
of ‘Priceless’, where LJ
delivers an intoxicated,
droning vocal melody
over a notably perky beat,
that practically teleports
the listener to somewhere
dark, booze drenched and
late.
LJ evokes the inde-
scribable and undefinable
feelings of love one can
feel another, setting his
infatuation against the
banal materialism so often
evoked on club tracks.
Admittedly, the lyrics do
not always hit home with
power, ‘Priceless’ is not
a love song for the ages,
but the vocal melody
LJ delivers adds well
to the track’s laid back,
danceable vibe, with
lyrics perhaps remaining
secondary.
‘Priceless’’ beat
revolves around an
impossibly catchy chord
progression delivered on
slippery marimba and
spacey synths, working
together to weave a psy-
chedelic, tropical pallet
of pure ear candy. Under-
neath this, bass, kicks and
snares are woven tasteful-
ly, never obscuring LJ’s
delivery and never failing
to get the listener moving.
LJ’s vocals come of a little
overproduced at times,
compressed heavily and

well worth a listen for
any fans of the genre.
A stand out intro-
duction to the group
is track ‘Life to Me’, a
slow burner with lyrics
on love and liberation.
A sonorous bass groove
oozes at the heart of this
track, locking in tightly
with punctuative drums
to gaurantee some
head bobbing. Buoyant
analogue synth chords
and Chic-esque guitar
chops flesh out the
rhythm section, adding
a little shimmer to the
affair, classic funk.
Atop this musical lazy
river, understated vocals
and a collection of
sparkling, delay-soaked
synths take turns explor-
ing the groove, adding
lyrical and sonic sweet-
ness to this sticky track.
