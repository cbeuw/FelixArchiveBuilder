Step 1: Obviously, the
ﬁrst step in nailing a date
on Tinder is getting that
date in the ﬁrst place. If
you’re struggling a little to
get those elusive matches
from people that are at
least more than a 3/10,
then you aren’t doing
Tinder right. You gotta
learn that sometimes,
reality needs embellish-
ing. A few exaggerations
won’t hurt. Photoshop
out those acne scars. Give
yourself a jawline. Say
you got into Oxbridge.
Step 2: You’ve got a
match! Finally. And this
time they deﬁnitely have
a pulse. Before you send
out your ﬁrst message
you have to think about
what kind of tone to set.
Humorous? Romantic?
Disinterested? Obviously,
you want to nail this date,
so whatever it is don’t tell
them what’s under the
patio.
Step 3: The conversa-
tion is going well. You’re
imagining you and your
future spouse’s lives
together and you ask them
out on a date. Where do
you bring someone on
the ﬁrst date, you ask.
Our answer: somewhere
you can really make your
intentions known without
violating your parole
agreement. That means,
of course, any café at least
100m from a school.
Step 4: It’s date day!
You’ve buffed up your
mole and smeared Tipex
on your teeth. Unfortu-
nately, its ﬁnally dawning
that you’re no way near as
cool or as attractive as you
were on your proﬁle. You
head to your date, with
some trepidation.
Step 5: You arrive
at the café at least 10
minutes early and settle
in to wait. Suddenly, they
walk in, lightly brushing
their hair aside in exactly
the manner you predicted
from stalking their Face-
book, Instagram, Yelp and
Google Plus accounts.
You are overwhelmed by
Feelings.
Step 6: First impres-
sions are hard, particu-
larly when you’ve given
someone such unrealistric
expectations, of beauty,
intelligence and number
of teeth. Instead, a better
course of action is to do
nothing. They can’t form
a bad ﬁrst impression if
there is no impression at
all.
Step 7: Your date
begins to look anxious,
searching for their ideal
online match. You can’t
bring yourself to approach
them so you sit and wait.
Fortunately, your dates
ideal online match has
just walked into the café.
They even have the face
you stole from Getty
images. They nonchalant-
ly saunter up to your date
and ask them a question.
Within minutes they are
both chatting, laughing,
ﬂirting. You watch in
silent horror.
Step 8: Your date
and their new aquaint-
ance settle down on the
table next to you clearly
enjoying one another’s
company. An hour passes
and they exchange
numbers, and make to
leave. You hear your dates
number and write it down.
Looking for a date? One of these likely living organisms could be yours!! // People we hope don’t sue us
Step 9: You call your
date, pretending it was the
acquaintance that bought
them coffee. You tell them
that you hope you never
see them again and that
they have a terrible per-
sonality. You have clearly
upset them dreadfully.
Step 10: You have
ruined something beau-
tiful. Another few dates
like this and your dream
partner will ﬁnally have
a self-esteem low enough
to ﬁnally consider you.
You look for more cafés at
least 100m from a school.
