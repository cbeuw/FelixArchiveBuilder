Shook: Becoming a father behind bars
S
hook is as close
to a perfect play
that I think I have
ever seen. Set
in a prison classroom,
three convicts, all with
pregnant girlfriends, are
receiving lessons on how
to be fathers. Opening
with rapid wit and banter
the play first comes across
as an entertaining but
fundamentally shallow
comedic experience. The
men, all violent criminals,
come across more like
boys than men as they
swap stories of school,
Avengers Endgame, and
trade sweets.
It is only when Grace
(Andrea Hall), their
teacher, comes in and
beginstryingtoteachthem
how to burp a baby that
the voids of these men’s
own childhoods emerge.
All three of them grew up
with absent fathers and
the theme repeats itself in
the next generation. The
tragedy that they will all
be absent from the births
of their first children,
despite them trying to be
better, is present in all of
their faces even if it is
never directly addressed.
In fact, Cain (Josh Finan)
the Liverpudlian motor-
mouth has already given
up. “Like we’ll ever be
good fucking dads,” he
shouts.
The joking moves
seamlessly from how
easy it was to get young
teachers to cry to discus-
sions of how best to slit
your wrists (sideways
for attention, lengthwise
for real) and your heart
goes out to these boys
who have been so cast
aside from society that
they are where “people
get sent” and there is no
lower to fall. Unlike Cain,
however, for the other two
classmates Jonjo (Josef
Davies) and Riyad (Ivan
Oyik) the classes are a
possible route to redemp-
tion. Former gang member
Riyad’s casual dominance
and imposing physical
presence masks an intense
hunger for self-improve-
ment. He is patiently
redoing his GCSEs and
in the quieter moments
of the play he admits to
the others that he dreams
of starting a business and
providing for his family.
As an audience we root
for Riyad because for a
moment he has become
like us, humanised to the
point that we feel like
we can understand him
entirely.
Tragically, the reality
of their situation drags
these boys back down
to earth. Riyad’s past
catches up with him and
he disappears into solitary
confinement never to be
seen again.
In the end, the real
victims are in the end
those unseen, unborn
children, who will, the
play suggests, end up
coming to the same jail
and having these same
conversations just like
their fathers. Desperately
sad and heart wrenching,
I came out of this play
with tears running down
my face and signed up
to volunteer in prisons. I
cannot recommend this
play enough.
