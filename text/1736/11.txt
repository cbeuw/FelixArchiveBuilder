A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
in their rooms, which has
been complained about
by some students – they
are paying the same for
a room with a worse
view. We’re considering
making a small shift of
around 5%, a reduction
for rooms with that worse
view, and an equivalent
increase spread across all
the rooms with a garden
view.
I think it would be unhelp-
ful to paint the picture in
terms of hall-by-hall costs
and such, not just because
of it being an inaccurate
picture due to the tech-
nical side, but also from
a welfare perspective.
We have the guarantee
of a halls bedspace for
every first-year student,
and that needs to be
protected. It also enters
a dangerous territory
where some students feel
resentment based on the
idea that they are getting
a sore deal just to benefit
others, which just isn’t
the whole picture and is
very unhelpful in terms
of having a discussion.
If those are the terms we
address this on, it raises a
slew of other issues – for
example, in the South
Kensington halls, the
room sizes are not all the
same. Some single rooms
are larger than others. By
pricing them all the same,
you could argue that
there is already a case for
some students within that
hall ‘subsidising’ others
within the hall, just by
virtue of the fact that they
pay the same for a smaller
room. The same goes
for the discussion about
the view in Eastside and
Southside rooms. On a
practical level, it just isn’t
helpful.
Felix: How do you
think moving to this
50/50 split might
affect students on a
community or wel-
fare level? The con-
struction of Wood-
ward has arguably
begun to lead to a
state of social or class
segregation in the
College. What are
your thoughts?
SS: The problem is that
this arises as a conse-
quence of wanting to do
something good, which is
to ensure there is provi-
sion of lower-cost housing
for students who are on
a smaller budget. On a
break-even model, that
naturally causes larger
prices elsewhere, and so
class segregation results.
Within that constraint,
there is no ‘correct’option
– it’s all a balancing act.
It’s a damaging thing to
the student community
– halls are so influential
in building student com-
munities in first year, and
university life is all about
meeting different people
and
diversity. Having a sit-
uation where people are
split on any demographic
basis, such as wealth, is
just damaging. People
don’t integrate well like
that. There needs to be a
fundamental conversation
about what we prioritise –
ensuring low-cost options
or somewhat equalising
prices to ensure we don’t
have wealth segregation.
Felix: The issues seem
to stem from the
College’s decision to
go with a break-even
model. What do you
think about using
a different model,
where the College
directly subsidises
halls prices from oth-
er revenue streams?
SS: If there is an option
along those lines, they ab-
solutely should – it is one
area where it makes a huge
difference to students,
both in terms of saving
students hundreds or up
to a thousand pounds per
year, but in terms of pro-
tecting student welfare in
terms of accessibility and
community. The College
should be recognising and
responding to that – with
the break-even model,
we’re in a situation where
there might not be any
acceptable option for
students. I really don’t
know whether that is
an option though – I
can’t say, not having the
College perspective.
I’m glad it isn’t a decision
I would make alone – it’s
one made by students at
the Union Council next
Tuesday.
The paper being present-
ed to Union Council at
the public meeting on the
3rd of December, in the
Read lecture theatre, is
available online at XYZ.
The process there will be
for students to discuss
whether they accept or
reject the model provided
by College. There will
also be discussion of
which direction students
want to take – prioritising
low-cost halls for acces-
sibility or reducing social
segregation by flattening
prices. The four options
presented in the paper are
not the only proposals;
they are a starting point
– Council could reject all
four options. The ongoing
process if that occurs
would also be discussed.
Felix: Rent renego-
tiations are clearly
a huge topic right
now – but you have,
of course, also been
working on other
things. Talk to us
about progress on
the liberation officers
reform discussed in
our last interview
[see issue 1732.]
SS: It’s more officially
underway now.Aworking
group has been set up in
conjunction with students
who are members of the
Community and Welfare
Board, which is one of the
subcommittees of Union
Council. We’re discussing
what roles currently exist,
what structure exists,
and what is missing, and
overall what needs to be
in place so that liberation
and community work
is properly done by the
Union.
We’re also thinking
about whether there are
specific groups we are
neglecting – for example,
we feel we may not be
representing students
from different economic
backgrounds successfully,
and the specific issues
that can face them. As a
result, we’re considering
introducing an ‘Equal
Opportunities Officer’,
or some such, which is
a role that exists in other
universities as well. With
the College’s new Access
and Participation Plan,
which aims to drastically
increase the number of
students from less well-off
economic backgrounds,
we need someone rep-
resenting them. Nothing
has been decided yet, but
these are the directions of
our early discussions.
We’re also looking
into structure – such as
creating student advocacy
groups with elected com-
mittees to work with the
Liberation and Communi-
ty Officers on their remits,
rather than having one
individual try to cover it
all. Hopefully that would
spread the workload and
make it easier to build
student communities –
rather than having just a
single person trying to
advocate for all women
or all disabled students at
Imperial, for example.
Felix: You mentioned
the Disabilities Of-
ficer there – can you
shed any light on
the Union’s plans to
support Disabilities
History Month?
SS: Yes! Disabilities
History Month is from the
22nd of November to the
22nd of December. The
theme this year is hidden
disabilities. So, we’ve just
hosted a talk from Eliza-
beth Takyi, who set up a
charity supporting adults
with dyslexia, and will be
running a comedy night
with comedians who each
have disabilities. There
will be staff members
giving their profile or
experiences based on
hidden disabilities as well.
The focus is on looking at
how disability is ‘more
than meets the eye’ – it
affects a lot of people who
are not, for example, in a
wheelchair.
A technical Editor’s note, for clarity:
Figures on the specific running costs and revenue generated from individual halls is not being factored into the discussion. By “subsidise”, the meaning is not that some
students are paying above the break-even point for their specific hall in order for students in other halls to pay below the break-even point. It refers specifically to a metric
which approximately describes how much is charged per square metre of room space on average. The value of a bedspace is not defined by the running costs – as an
illustrative and hypothetical example, the cost of building Beit may well have been paid off at this point, whereas the cost of building Woodward may still be being paid
off. This means that, if one were to look purely at the cost of running Beit, it may be substantially lower than that of Woodward – because the cost of building would have
been paid off over a long period of time by students in previous years. Despite this, Beit is (arguably) a more desirable location as it is next to campus and does not require
travel costs, and so should be priced accordingly. This is similar to saying that how much is left on the mortgage for a property does not define its value – a house with a
paid-off mortgage in South Kensington will still cost a lot more per square metre than a house with an ongoing mortgage in Acton. Indeed, a house with the mortgage
paid off is not free based on the fact someone else previously paid it off! On this basis, the perspective by which the balance is set between different halls is not based on
their individual running costs, but the cost and break-even point of the property portfolio as a whole, as well as other factors such as location, accessibility to the university
(i.e. providing affordable halls), and so on. See below for further discussion.
