The All-Nighter Film List for December
W
ith the end
of term
l o o m i n g
I’m sure
many of you are feeling
a mix of fatigue, anxiety,
and excitement; so what
better to re-energise you
for these last few weeks
than an all-nighter of
films?
Z O M B I E L A N D :
DOUBLE TAP (19:00)
It’s been an incredible
10 years since the first
film graced the screens
but now they’re back.
The once unknown cast
of newbies and ‘freshers’
have become superstar
sensations. With Woody
Harrelson, Jesse Eisen-
berg, Emma Stone and
Abigail Breslin reprising
their roles in this sequel,
this fun zombie-slaying
screenplay is the perfect
start.
JOKER (21:45)
For those of you yet
to experience the tension
and thrill of Todd Phillips’
origin story of the famous
batman villain, the second
film on the list is well
worth the experience.
Packed with the adrena-
line of an action film, this
will keep your eyes locked
on the screen throughout
as you explore the story
of how Arthur Fleck came
‘face-to-face’ with his
alter-ego, “The Joker”.
JUDY (23:55)
The third film’s change
in stance from action and
horror won’t let you down.
‘Bridget Jones’ actress
Renée Zellweger plays
the titular character of the
legendary Judy Garland,
who 30 years after playing
the iconic character of
Dorothy in ‘The Wizard
of Oz’ comes to London
to perform in sold-out
shows. This film will pull
on the heartstrings and
warm you to the character
of Judy – and her capti-
vating account of her final
London concert.
DR. SLEEP (02:15)
The fourth film heads
back to another sequel,
this one firmly along the
path of horror. An adren-
aline boost for those who
need it at 2 in the morning
(and forgot to get coffee
in time), this film sees the
character Danny Torrance
from ‘The Shining’ all
grown up – and as a strug-
gling alcoholic. He meets
a young girl, Abra Stone,
whose ‘Shining’ powers
are even more powerful
than his. Together, they
try and stop a cult from
feeding off their abilities.
This is one film you can’t
miss; the sequel to Stanley
Kubrick’s tour-de-force is
sure to be a thriller…
THE PEANUT BUTTER
FALCON (04:45)
The finale, watched
through inevitably
slightly-bleary eyes, once
again takes a turn for
the more light-hearted
as we explore the rela-
tionship between a boy
so desperate to become
a professional wrestler
that he runs away from
his nursing home, and an
outlaw, played by Shia
LeBeouf, who befriends
the boy and becomes his
coach. This film is not
worth missing out on –
especially if you’ve made
it that far!
Enjoy the sound of
these films? Then you’re
