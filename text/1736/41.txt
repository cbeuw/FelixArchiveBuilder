New Finance vs. Old Finance
tomers impacted reached
32 million; nobody can
guarantee that events like
this will cease to occur
in the future. As Figure 2
illustrates, the function-
ality offered by the new
entrants in the banking
space can sometimes be
quite limited. Customers
cannot yet find all of the
services provided by a
traditional retail institu-
tion, such as credit cards,
loans and direct debits.
This limitation will es-
pecially be felt by older
customers, who expect
a bank to provide all of
the above-mentioned
features.
Therefore, the risk of
these applications not
expanding beyond their
young-adult user base
still persists. How popular
these financial services
providers will become
directly affects their
profitability. Most cur-
rently enjoy a high valu-
ation. However, questions
remain about if and how
can they build a business
model which will lead
them to profitability.
For instance, Monzo
saw its net losses increase
by 54 percent in February
of 2019, following a
massive personnel ex-
pansion in order to cope
with its increasing user
base. Challenger bank’s
answer to the issue of
profitability has centered
around revenue gener-
ation through monthly
subscription services
and in-app marketplaces.
They usually offer cus-
tomers core services via
their free tiers and seek
to entice them to upgrade
to premium tiers in order
to gain access to niche
services.
As far as marketplaces
are concerned, they gen-
erally appeal to business
users by allowing them
to link their accounts to a
variety of business tools,
including professional
chat and accounting appli-
cations. The ultimate aim
is to limit their reliance on
individual consumers and
expand their reach into the
business community.
Conclusion
Digital-only banks have
indisputably disrupted the
banking sector. With a
host of features related to
helping customers assume
more control over their
spending and simplifying
transactions, they have
managedtoattractasignif-
icant user base and forced
traditional competitors to
adapt to an ever-changing
technological landscape.
Given the challenges
they currently face, it is
difficult to argue that they
can fully replace high-
street providers. None-
theless, their presence
benefits the financial
services and fintech
sectors as a whole. In the
end, more competition is
always considered desira-
ble from consumers’ point
of view.
