targets to drive the res-
toration of species and
habitats.
• Establish a new en-
vironmental tribunal to

with environmental and
nature-recovery obliga-
tions.
Green
• Get the UK on track
to reducing climate emis-
sions to net zero by 2030.
• Meet most energy needs
through the domestic
production of renewable
energy.
• Plan to have a combined
investment of over £100
billion a year in the Green
New Deal.
• Introduce new support
for solar, geothermal,
tidal, hydro and other
renewable energies to
provide much of the
remainder of the UK’s
energy supply by 2030.
• Spend £2.5 billion a
year on new cycleways
and footpaths, built using
sustainable materials,
such as woodchips and
sawdust.
• Remove subsidies to
the oil and gas industries.
• Invest £2 billion a
year in training and skills
(including new appren-
ticeships), to help people
access the new, decent
jobs created through the
transition to a low carbon
economy.
• Prepare for the rapid
decommissioning of
North Sea oil rigs and the
phasing out of the UK’s
remaining coal plants

phasing in a tax on meat
and dairy products over

stations. The green party
has stated that nuclear
is “a distraction from
developing renewable
energy”, and it carries
“unacceptable risk for
the communities living
close to nuclear energy
facilities”, “creates un-
manageable quantities of
radioactive waste” and is
“linked with the produc-
tion of world-destroying
nuclear weapons.”

flights and introduce a
Frequent Flyer Levy to
reduce the impact of the
15% of people who take
70% of flights and stop

unconventional forms of
fossil fuel extraction
• Reduce pesticide and
fungicide use by at least
50% by overall weight by

for wildlife.

mentation; and establish a

and human rights.
• Regulate financial
services to encourage
green investments, in-
cluding requiring pension
funds and managers to
show that their portfolio
investments are consistent
with the Paris Agreement
• Establish a Department
for Climate Change and
Natural Resources and
appoint a cabinet-level
Chief Secretary for Sus-
“Ban
advertising
for flights and
introduce a
Frequent Flyer
Levy”
“End support

tainability in the Treasury.

of government
• Establish UK and local
Citizens’ Climate Assem-
blies to engage the public

£12 billion over five years

energy and aim to reach at
least 80 per cent renewa-
ble electricity in the UK
by 2030.
• Require all new
homes and non-domestic
buildings to be built to a
zero-carbon standard.
• Cut energy bills, end
fuel poverty by 2025 and
reduce emissions from

for green products and
services with steadily
higher green criteria
in public procurement
policy.
• End support from UK
Export Finance for fossil
fuel-related activities,
and press for higher
environmental standards
for export credit agencies
throughout the OECD.
• Accelerate the rapid
take-up of electric
vehicles by reforming
vehicle taxation, and
invest in public transport,
buses, trams and railways
to enable people to
travel more easily while
reducing their impact on
the environment.

to restore the natural en-
vironment through setting
legally binding near-term
and long-term targets for
improving water, air, soil
and biodiversity, and sup-
ported by funding streams

five years.

tackling climate change
while creating new jobs
and reducing social and
economic inequalities.

tages include the use huge
amounts of water, causing
earthquakes, release of
methane, and severe
contamination of water
resources.
• Blue Belt programme
– programme supporting
the UK government’s
commitment to provide
long term protection for
the marine environment.
Conclusion
Once again, it is impor-
tant to take the promises
of the parties with a grain
of salt, as there isn’t a
system holding them
responsible for deliver-
ing what they propose;
nonetheless manifestos
give a general insight to
the goals of the party and
how they try to deliver
on them. Also, to achieve
anything, there will be
financial and opportunity
costs, which are not men-
tioned in the manifestos;
this is something else to
be wary of.
Climate change and en-
vironmental issues are the
most important issues of
our generation, and there-
fore it definitely should be
considered when casting
your vote.
