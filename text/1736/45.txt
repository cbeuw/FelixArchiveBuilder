I
first saw this amazing
quick pasta dish
being made in the
Netflix film ‘Chef’
(100% great to watch
when you’re procrastinat-
ing your next lab report
or essay) and it looked
delicious. Thanks to social
media sites stalking my
life, it didn’t take long for
a recipe to appear on my
YouTube suggested.
The simplicity of the
recipe means that you can
taste and appreciate every
ingredient – which is why
I would recommend using
fresh ingredients if you
have the time (however
for everyone who is busy
with work I’ve included
substitution ingredients
which make the recipe
even quicker!)
Pasta Aglio e Olio
Ingredients
This will make 4-6 portions depending on how
hungry you are!
• 500g of your favourite pasta
• 5 tbsp olive oil (can substitute a different so
long at it doesn’t have a strong flavour)
• 5 big cloves of garlic, thinly sliced (can be
substituted this for 4 tbsp garlic paste)
• dried birds eye chilli flakes
• Bunch of parsley, finely chopped (can be sub-
stituted for 5 tbsp dried parsley)

Boil pasta until ready (follow packet instructions; always salt your water) - set aside 1/2 cup of
the pasta water for later. Leave the pasta in the sieve so you can use the same pot to cook the rest
of the dish.
While the pasta is boiling is a great time to slice the garlic and chop the parsley
In the pot which had the pasta, add the olive oil and turn on the heat.
You want to make a layer of oil at the bottom of the pot, but you can use less oil if you prefer
however this might result in the pasta feeling a little dry.
Once the oil is HOT, add the sliced garlic, salt, pepper, and half the parsley - mix until the garlic
is golden then add the chilli flakes.
Add the pasta, the pasta water, and the remaining raw parsley and mix!
Plate up, take a pic for your story, and munch. Try serving with grated cheese – parmesan or
cheddar work best - garlic bread and a leafy salad.
“The simplicity
of this recipe
means that
you can
taste every
ingredient - so
I recommend
fresh
ingredients”
This is a very versatile
recipe. The simple, basic
flavours are a great base
to which you can add
additional ingredients
– from my experience,
mushrooms, chicken and
fresh chillies work really
well. You would add the
additional ingredients at
the start of step 3 – be
careful that the garlic
doesn’t burn so add it after
your extra ingredients.
This is an italian classic
as you can tell by the
name. It literally trans-
lates to pasta with garlic
and oil so nothing too
fancy but it will be sure
to wow your friends who
love the prospect of being
made an authentic dish.
Bonus points if you wave
your hands around as you
say it.
Another great thing
about this recipe’s sim-
plicity is that it makes this
a great one to practice to
perfection. That means
you can become a pro at
this to really become the
show off of the group. A
dish like this can quickly
become second nature to
you and your flare to it
can become an staple of
any group meal.
