T
he price of
rent in Col-
l e g e - o w n e d
halls is set to
increase again this year,
with the student union
acting in a consultation
role with students.
The College’s total
necessary revenue from
halls rent is increasing by
12.2% in just one year in
order to match a break-
even model, in which
revenue exactly offsets
the cost of running halls.
This amounts to approxi-
mately £22 million being
generated in revenue per
year at the new prices just
from halls rent, based on
calculations using data
from a Union Council
paper. The increase is due
to new costs included in
the break-even model
that were not included in
previous years – in other
words, from next year
new students will be being
charged for services as
part of their halls rent that
their predecessors did not
have to pay towards.
This breakeven con-
dition currently acts as a
strong constraint on the
negotiations; the options
of the Union in their con-
sultation role is primarily
to decide how the price
hike will be distributed
across different halls.
The renegotiation
precedes the opening of
the new Kemp Porter
halls in Acton, adjacent to
Woodward and featuring
functionally identical
rooms. The opening of the
new hall, featuring over
700 bedspaces, will shift
half of all first-year stu-
dents to Acton, with the
distribution of first-year
students between South
Kensington and Acton
halls becoming 51% to
49% respectively - as
opposed to 73% to 27% in
the 2019/20 year.
The Deputy President
(Welfare) and Union
President will be taking
the issue to Union
Council on Tuesday 3rd
December, which will be
held in Sherfield’s Read
lecture theatre at 7pm
and to which they have
strongly encouraged any
and all students to attend.
The paper they have pre-
pared outlines four initial
options as a starting point
for discussion, though
the Council can decide to
reject all four.
At the last rent negotia-
tion prior to the opening of
Woodward in 2015/16, the
Union Council decided to
set a ratio of 2:1 in terms
of cost per square metre
between South Kensing-
ton and Acton halls, with
the justification being that
it ensured a set of afforda-
ble halls for a quarter of
students in Acton on a
“subsidy” basis from the
remaining three-quarters
of students in South Kens-
ington. However, the shift
in student distribution
means a discussion about
the degree of subsidy
needs to be revisited.
This is the basis of the
major differences between
the four options proposed
in the paper – in essence,
whether to continue the
practice of charging a 2:1
ratio and applying a flat
12.2% price hike across
all halls, or shifting that
ratio to either a greater
or lesser extreme. Sub-
sidising the Acton halls
ensures affordable halls
and accessibility to the
university, whereas a vote
to flatten prices reduces
the growing problem of
social segregation in the
College community.

and just prior to the opening of the new Kemp Porter halls
“The
College's total
necessary
revenue from
halls rent to
break even is
increasing by
12.2%”
Some students are already
calling for the College to
subsidise halls from other
revenue streams rather
than continue to work on
a break-even basis.
Regardless of which
option one would choose,
the prices of halls are
reaching a crux point.
They are no longer much,
if any, cheaper than
private accommodation.
The College provides a
cost breakdown for budg-
eting for new students on
their website, which itself
states that the average cost
for halls of residence and
private accommodation
only differ by £1.31 per
week. As an alternate
metric: the proposed new
prices for a single ensuite
room in Beit – the type
of room for which they
have the most bedspaces
– are around £260 a week.
Spareroom provides
average rental prices by
postcode, and SW7’s is
between £230 and £300 –
a search for properties in
a more specific area local
to the South Kensington
campus yields multiple
results in the £260 region.
The same applies for the
Acton halls.
Though halls provide
social opportunities that
are beneficial for new
students, the cost of
paying enough to reach
the break-even point at
the College is apparently
equivalent to the cost of
paying for the profit of a
private landlord.
Felix will report on
the results of the Union
Council meeting in the
final issue of term.
“Some
students
are calling
for College
to subsidise
halls from
other revenue
streams”
The four options also
work on the basis of some
initial suggestions, such as
keeping the cost of Kemp
Porter and Woodward the
same, as well as evening
the cost between South-
side and Eastside halls in
Prince’s Gardens.
A noteworthy point in
the Council paper is that
the option also exists to
reject the break-even
model entirely, at which
point the process would
stop while the Union
re-approached the College
to determine next steps.
