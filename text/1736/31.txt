Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth
GAMES

Games Writer
N
ow I don’t
know about
you, but
Digimon was
the bread and butter of
my childhood, with its
classic animation style
and collection of surpris-
ingly dark moments. I’m
still traumatised by their
equivalent of Sean Bean,
Leomon, who seemingly
could not go an episode
without falling.
So you can imagine
that for me, it was a very
pleasant surprise when I
heard that Digimon Story:
Cyber Sleuth and the
follow-up game Hacker’s
Memories were coming to
the Switch in a combined
package. Fortunately, I
managed to get a press
copy courtesy of Namco
Bandai – which is timely,
given that it’s the same
week as Cyber Monday.
I had previously played
Hacker’s Memories on the
PS4, and can say that it has
carried over beautifully to
the Switch in numerous
ways.
First things first, the
biggest positive: my
favourite thing about this
port is the ability to play
the game portably without
sacrificing graphical
quality. It is an absolute
wonder, especially given
the game’s long comple-
tion time. Previously, I
felt unable to fully invest
the time needed to finish
off the PS4 version –
which doesn’t apply now
that I have the chance to
take it on the road. There
are occasional framerate
drops when the Switch is
undocked, but this minor
setback is fully worth the
flexibility and graphic
fidelity.
The game itself
revolves around the havoc
that is being unleashed in
the digital world known as
EDEN. Our protagonists
in each game – highly
colourful in Cyber Sleuth
and deliberately bland
in Hacker’s memories
– attempt to unfurl the
mysteries behind various
unexplained hackings,
along with strange

physical phenomena, as
the digital world seems
to be leaking into the real
world. We follow the pro-
tagonists as they endeav-
our to discover the cause.
In Cyber Sleuth you are
part of a detective agency
working to figure out
what’s going on, whilst
in Hacker’s Memory you
play as a member of a
group of hackers.
In terms of mechanics,
the battle system utilises
a classic ‘rock-paper-scis-
sors’ style effectiveness
system – vaccine is effec-
tive against virus, virus is
effective against data, and
so on – with an additional
layer of ‘typing’ such as
Dark, Light, Earth, or
Electric. These familiar
mechanics are combined
with attack cut scenes that
are visually gorgeous – es-
pecially as you get a kick
of nostalgia from seeing
your favourite Digimon
from childhood rendered
in fantastic 3D detail. The
‘digivolving’ system has
a magnificent amount of
depth that encourages
the player to evolve and
devolve numerous times
in order to get the strong-
est Digimon possible.
All the while, you are
also encountering and
using your favourite com-
panions throughout the
adventure – a particular
favourite of mine being
Diaboromon (the one that
was featured in Digimon
The Movie and almost
nuked a country!)
I strongly enjoyed the
game’s music, but its im-
plementation has flaws – a
notable downside is that
some overused tracks can
get a bit repetitive at times,
such as the standard battle
theme. However, that’s
balanced by the outside
battle music, which is
refreshing and alternating
as you continue through
the game.
All in all, the port is
great and I highly recom-
mend it. Despite a few
minor downsides, such as
the framerate drops and
a few repetitive tracks,
the game encompasses a
sense of reliving of child-
hood, and delving further
into the digital world.

pickups. Recently people
are becoming a lot more
savvy about the worth of
their old games, and it is
becoming increasingly
difficult to find bargains
at a market or car boot
sale, but you can still get
lucky. If you are looking
for insane deals, stick to
charity shops or eBay and
hope that fortune strikes.
But if you just want to
find something specific,
that rare gem you’ve
spent years searching for,
I recommend going to a
convention! Retro gaming
conventions are great,
but not that common.
You will, however, find
some relevant stalls in any
gaming convention you
go to. Insomnia, the UK’s
biggest gaming conven-
tion, and Comic-con are
my personal favourites.
You’ll find lots of people
selling literal crates of
old games – at the last
Comic-con I managed
to snag almost every
Spyro game from a single
seller (keep your eye out
for an upcoming article
about them here in Felix
Games!) Also, conven-
tions are quite possibly
the best environment to
be in for an avid game
collector. You’ll meet
many like-minded people
that you can spark a con-
versation with, and maybe
even make some friends
you can trade with in the
future.
Hopefully you have
a better idea of how to
get started on your game
collecting journey! Last
points: make sure you
know what your collect-
ing for! If it’s retro games,
then buy in-person and
ideally from a convention

or a charity shop. If it’s
newer titles, then buying
online or in a CeX shop
is your best option. Just
remember to have fun
with it, and don’t go over-
board – or you’ll never
get through that dreaded
backlog.
