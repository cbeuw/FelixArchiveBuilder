world of complex mul-
ti-variables. In all of this
we need to be aware of
our own traumas and the
traumas of others, what is
internalised, our experi-
ences - especially those of
our childhoods and form-
ative years - and the many
intersections present in all
communities.
I recently started
re-listening to an old
podcast series that I was
hooked on in first year,
when I went through hard
struggles and had to move
halls. The podcast series
(Russell Brand’s ‘Under
the Skin’) is one I can
thoroughly recommend,
and not a set of interviews
that some people would
think I naturally gravitate
towards: Interviews with
people on the left, social
activists, feminist authors,
and philosophers.
For those of you with a
keen eye for Felix’s news,
you’ll have seen in the
‘A Conversation With’
section last week that the
Union President, Abhijay
Sood, was questioned
about my departure - at
that point a very fresh and
mostly unknown fact. For
those of you who have
already heard, please
forgive me for reiterating,
but for those of you who
haven’t let it be known:
I am resigning as CGCU
President, effective 29th
November. An email is in
the works and should soon
be going out to the 4200
students we as a Constitu-
ent Union represent.
I am to be succeeded
by an outstanding Vice
President to the Constitu-
ent Union, Fatima Khan,
who I wish the best of
luck. Our selection of a
new Vice President (via
internal AGM and email
voting) will be sent out
over this weekend.
I understand that this
is uncharted waters, as
resignations and CU Pres-
idents departing mid-term
is an occurrence of around
once-a-decade regularity
(2009/10 being the last
time). I also acknowledge
that ‘co-opting’, as we call
it, for such a senior role is
in violation of the Union
bye-laws. However,
we felt in this case that
not using eVoting for a
broader public vote was
for the best. I am sure the
CGCU committee I leave
behind will be open to
that if it is what you, our
students, think should
happen.
To our 17 Clubs and
Societies: it has been the
greatest honour to be able
to work with you. Your
professionalism and ded-
ication is what makes the
student experience here at
Imperial so unique for so
many.
To the engineering
students I was elected
to represent, the medics
who stood next to me at
the St Mary’s debate, and
the postgrad students I’ve
assisted in their fights
within the Union and
Council: I am sorry, but
representing you, through
your Unions and ICU in
general are experiences
that will never leave me.
To the ICU staff: I am
sorry that the student
union is currently in the
state it is in. I really hope
that the positive curvature
imparted by the appoint-
ment of Tom Newman,
the new Head of Student
Experience, and the
departure of some other
staff members revitalises
ICU – and enables it to
become the great student
union it can be. You all try
so hard, and as a student
volunteer I’d like to thank
you for what you do for
the student body. I may
not have always seen eye
to eye on some issues, but
I truly wish you the best
for the future.
So it is now, softly, that
I leave you, with much ap-
preciation and admiration
for my committee and our
students for what we have
achieved and the legacy
that we continue to build
on – that from our pre-
decessors of the Central
Technical College and the
City and Guilds College,
the great institution that,
along with many others,
merged to form Imperial
in years past.
Goodbye.
I
mperial is a strange
place. A week here
can be a long time,
and yet two years can
pass in an instant. I re-
member when, as a young
fresher, I rather cockily
walked up to the CGCU
office, asking about some
position they had vacant
for “Bolt” editor.
Since then, in the words
of the replicant Roy Batty
in Blade Runner: “I’ve
seen things you people
wouldn’t believe.” The
most talented students
around me just get fucked
over by their circumstanc-
es. The best of friends
become the most bitter of
enemies overnight. Such
is life, and it can be hard
at points.
Uni life, like Imperial
and the mighty CGCU,
is also diverse. I urge you
to make the most of your
time here. Get involved,
and (although repeating it
may make me seem like
a broken record at this
point) please take every
opportunity that comes
to you to do, and see, and
learn. Grow yourself, get
into politics and art, liter-
ature and psychology - as
well the science or engi-
neering or medicine you
study and practice here
as part of your degrees.
Moreover learn from your
mistakes; that is how we
grow and develop.
Mistakes, misdemean-
ours, misinterpretations,
and cock-ups happen. We
all make them, and if you
ask anyone who knows (or
has known) me personally
then they will know that I
make them a lot. For this,
I am sorry – in my own
way. One of the many
comments on life I would
also like to mention to
you now is that nothing in
life is black or white. We
are made of and live in a
Goodbye
