UK Election Manifestos Review
POLITICS

O
n the 20th
N o v e m b e r
the Liberal
D e m o c r a t s
released their election
manifesto, summarising
their plans for the country
if they win the general
election. Unsurprisingly,
the manifesto was geared
around the issue of
Brexit with the Lib Dems
promising to unilaterally
revoke Article 50 if they
win a majority and to push
for a second referendum
if they don’t. The total
rejection of the result of
a popular referendum can
only be viewed as undem-
ocratic even with the view
that a general election win
gives them the mandate to
do so as general elections,
with this countries ﬂawed
First Past the Post system
and all the covert cross
party deals are inherently
less democratic than one
person one vote referenda.
The Lib Dems appraisal
of themselves as the
party which champions
the People’s Vote is com-
pletely undermined by
their abandonment of this
sensible policy in their
manifesto. Elsewhere the
Lib Dems promise an
appealing £7 billion a year
extra funding for the NHS.
However, they mean to
pay for this extra funding
by raising income tax by
1% in ALL tax bands in-
cluding the poorest people
who are least able to pay
it. With life in austerity
Britain already so hard for
so many people, propos-
ing to raise taxes on the
poor is a uniquely cruel
thing to do which even the
Tories haven’t gone so far
as to suggest.
One demographic the
Lib Dems seem particu-
larly keen to attract is
young voters with their
promises to reintroduce
maintenance grants for
the poorest students and
their controversial Help
to Rent scheme both of
which are to be paid for
by a supposed £50 billion
boost to our economy
caused by us staying in the
EU. The reintroduction
of maintenance grants is
particularly rich coming
from the party who,
along with the Tories,
betrayed their student
base by tripling tuition
fees in 2010 and saddled
a generation of students
with insurmountable debt
(a policy Jo Swinson
personally voted for). In
addition, the Help to Rent
scheme, which promises a
£2000 government loan to
help 18-30 year-olds pay
down deposits on rented
accommodation, amounts
to nothing more but
greater debt for struggling
young people. For me, the
Lib Dem’s promises to
young people ring hollow,
it’s all a matter of too little
too late.

T
he Conservatives
announced their
manifesto on the
24th November
with the promise to de-
liver their EU withdrawal
deal being central to
their proposals. To the
Conservatives credit
the deal is a remarkable
demonstration of self-de-
ception and hypocrisy,
having previously voted
twice against Theresa
May’s deal Boris has
managed to renegotiate a
near identical deal which
he and his supporters
now rapturously praise.
Where the deal differs
to Theresa May’s is in
its abandonment of all
concrete promises to
retain workers’ rights, its
removal of safeguards
for the NHS post-Brexit
and in economically
severing Northern Ireland
from the rest of the UK
by leaving Northern
Ireland practically within
the EU customs union
whilst taking the rest of
the UK out. Throughout
the campaign Boris has
continually parroted his
slogan ‘Get Brexit Done’
meant to appeal to voters’
fatigue with the whole
Brexit process however
his deal does not result
in the straightforward
withdrawal he pretends
it does. The withdrawal
agreement doesn’t secure
trade deals with the EU
which would need to be
negotiated during a 1 or
2 year transition period
during which time the
UK would still follow EU
rules and pay money to
the EU budget, hardly an
attractive proposal to the
nationalistic Brexiteers
the Conservatives are
trying to win over.
Secondary to Brexit
are the Conservatives
minor social spending
plans. Core amongst
these are the promise of
hiring 50,000 more nurses
and building ‘40’ more
hospitals. Unsurprisingly
the pledge of nurses is
not clearly costed and the
40 new hospitals are not
costed at all owing to the
fact they aren’t intended
to be built next parliament
making it nothing more
than an empty promise.
If the 50,000 new nurses
are delivered it will only
just bring the number of
nurses per person back to
the level before Tory cuts.
In fact the entire mani-
festo can be summed up
as the vague promise of
funding to services which
the Tories themselves
brought to the brink of
ruin throughout the last
decade of their ideological
austerity. The Conserva-
tives cannot be trusted to
save the services they are
actively destroying. Just
last month representatives
of the government met
with US private healthcare
corporations to discuss
the sell-off of our NHS
in a post-Brexit trade deal
with Trump. This is no
longer idle speculation
but a very real threat to all
of us.

Brexit policy: cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.
Brexit policy: pass the Withdrawal Agreement by Christmas and leave on January 31st with that deal.
