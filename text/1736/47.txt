cooking this pasta may
lead to death.
Orecchiette
Another versatile pasta,
the little ears are perfect
for scooping up sauces,
meat, cheese, and the like.
A fancy alternative to our
penne and fusilli.
Best served with:
Sauces containing small,
round things (like peas,
mini meatballs), or rich,
cheesy sauces.
Farfalle
They look like bow-
ties, and that’s why we
love them. That and
the textural distinction
between the soft wings
and the denser middle bit.
Best served with:
Nothing overly rich or
complex. Farfalle is the
protagonist and the sauce
should only be nominated
for supporting roles.
Conchiglie and con-
chiglioni
Conchiglie are your
shell pasta and conchigli-
oni the shell if it held a
small family of sumo
wrestlers. If you hold
one close to your ear, you
can hear the sea. Or the
frenzied cries of Italian
nonnas bewailing your
complete disregard for
tradition. They both sound
similar. Here’s a fun ex-
periment: hold a piece of
conchiglie next to a piece
of orechiette and record
the results of this magical
interaction.
Best served with:
cheesy sauces! Something
about the shape demands
it be filled with a thick,
velvety sauce that isn’t
too much of a puzzle on
the palate. It would also
work well with sturdy
meat-based sauces but
that’s much less sexy.
Rotelle
These are shaped
like wheels with spokes
and everything. I’m not
exactly sure why they’re a
thing and its resemblance
to an artifical real-world
object just makes me
think of that penis-shaped
pasta so adored by giggly
bachelorettes the world
over. I’m sure it has a rich
history but it’s a pass for
me.
Best served with:
Plenty of glue and
macaroni to make your
own 3D pasta wagon.
Its like love at first sight// Freepik
works well.
Busiate
A friend got me this one
as a souvenir one year.
It’s long, its spirally, it’s
old-timey ringlets or (sim-
ilarly old-timey) turkey
twizzlers, but a pasta. It’s
still in my cupboard.
Best served with:
Apparently only served
with pesto alla trapanese,
a pesto with almonds,
tomatoes, garlic, and
basil. I have a nut-allergic
housemate so, for me,

Then drive it into ditch of
heavily salted water at a
rolling boil and throw the
result away. Stop playing
with your food.
Macaroni
One-trick pony. Mac
and cheese. That’s about
it? Two tricks if you go
full Asian and do a soup
macaroni. That said, those
two tricks are really quite
good and perfect for a lazy
night in so we recommend
saving a bag for those
rainy days.
Best served with: Lots
and lots of cheese. Has
there ever been a better
comfort food than mac
and cheese? A departure
from tradition, but I
like topping mine with
sriracha (look away,
Italian grannies).
Anelli, Calamarata,
Rigatoni
Anelli are our baby
rings found in Spaghet-
ti-O’s amongst other
things. Feed your Anelli
enough rare candy and
watch it evolve into
calamarata, a mid-sized,
smooth ring. By the time
you’re ready to face the
Elite Four, you should
have yourself a large,
ridged tube by the name
of Rigatoni.
Best served with:
Anelli can’t do more than
swim around in soup. Ca-
lamarata is okay for most
sauces but really, we’re all
waiting for rigatoni which
can do all the things that
