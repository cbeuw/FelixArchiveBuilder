1/3 analogue, 1/3 digital, 1/3 nature: Dominik Eulberg
D
ominik Eulberg,
the 41-year-old
recluse bird-
watcher, who
happens to also make some
of the best German techno,
says that he feels drawn to
the animalistic aspects of
the genre. The sweating,
the entranced dancing,
the rapture when the cre-
scendo lifts your feet off
the ground. He brought
all of that to Night Tales,
whose venue in Hackney
has been operating since
the summer of 2018 and
offers entertainment quite
uncharacteristic of the
capital, on Friday, the 22nd
of November.
Doing an all-night set
is very brave, and for
many DJs it doesn’t work
out. I’ve seen many big
ones fail to deliver the
kind of performance that
makes you stay until the
end - even those who are
spectacular in a more
condensed 2-hour format.
That wasn’t the case for
Dominik. The young BoJo
lookalike slowly ramped
up the pressure, and it
is as much down to his
incredibly astute sense for
mixing as it is due to his
incredibly poignant and
punchy discography that
the set just kept getting
better. The bed-like seats
in the venue’s garden were
also the perfect pitstop,
helping keep legs fresh.
The atmosphere, which
was the only thing pre-
venting this from being
a perfect set, was at first
diluted by the abundant
day-trippers and Hack-
ney-hipster socialites.
But slowly, in the front
left corner, there seemed
to be building an enclave
of those who were there
to tear up the dancefloor.
There was the head-to-toe
tattooed guy with hair
down to his waist giving
it his double-jointed all,
twisting to the melodies
like a venomous snake, his
shirt long since on the floor
next to him. There were his
friends, ideal blackbodies
in their Docs and leather,
vibrating all around him
like bey-blades. The few
words that were exchanged
were all in German. We
didn’t need to speak. This
was little Berlin in the
heart of East London.
When Dominik talks
about music, he talks about
sea snails, about birds,
and about the rustling
of the leaves. These are
sounds he regularly uses
in his compositions,
rounding them out with
his beastly modular synths
and perfectly symmetric
clicky beats. His agenda
is as much to make people
dance as it is to spread
awareness of environmen-
tal conservation. He might
resemble the Tory leader
but in politics he could not
be further removed from
him.
“When we see or hear a
rare bird sing, we all giggle
like little children,” he says
of his everyday life in a
little town between Frank-
furt and Cologne. From
this heart of nature, in a
house overlooking a lake,
next to a bird reserve, he
makes his music. “Nature
is the world’s greatest
artist,” he explains. I
am inclined to agree. If
you’re passionate about
both nature and techno, I
sense that his music will
make you feel things that
no other music can. His
deftness of touch, and the
elegance of his melodies
are unparalleled. His bass
ALWAYS bites hard. You
might be in the middle of a
forest, dazzling colours all
around, and then a storm
comes. He flicks it around
like that.
As an intro to the man,
I recommend checking out
his Cercle set on Youtube
or his bird-themed website.
You won’t be sorry.
Starcrawlercomfortably blows minds at Camden show
A
h, Underworld.
So many
i n c o m p l e t e
memories of
too many nights out. So
many vivid memories of
strange men standing just
a bit too close when you’re
just trying to have a night
out with friends. Despite
my current opinion of
Underworld, it will always
hold a special place in my
wannabe-Camden-rocker
heart. So much so when
I saw Starcrawler were
playing I knew I had to go, if
only to see what a gig night
was like there. Walking in,
my sober self unjustifiably
felt the same thrill getting
past security as I normally
do when they fail to notice
I’m completely inebriated.
The support, Pretty Sick,
were drawling out some
doom-inspired punk songs,
with singer Sabrina Fuentes
rasping over them in her
New York twang. They
were actually pretty sick,
seemingly holding some
good core grunge principles
to heart while incorporating
an indie twist in their guitar
line. The anticipation grew
after Pretty Sick finished, a
rising hubbub in the air as the
crowd mentally, physically
and emotionally prepared for
the incoming onslaught. 		
Eventually, with
anticipation at a high, the
headliner appeared, one by
one as first drums then bass,
guitar and finally vocals
built up to their first song
‘Home Alone’. Starcrawler
then kicked into one of
their first releases, ‘Used
to Know’, off their first EP
which went on to garner
them plenty of attention. The
riff-driven, catchy tune soon
had a pit going while singer
Arrow de Wilde (real name)
literally pranced about
above us, stretching and
rolling across the stage. A
few songs later and guitarist
Henri Cash’s cheesy grins
emanated across the room as
he strutted his stuff wearing
a white cowboy suit covered
in glittery roses and ants.
This was a nod to their other
first song ‘Ants’ which they
then rushed into, de Wilde
capturing our attention
while performing as she first
strangled herself with the
mic cable before making ob-
scene gestures with the mic
itself. However, the majority
of the songs throughout the
set seemed to be lacking,
despite the energy from the
band and crowd. Their punk
energy and style didn’t quite
match up with the music,
with lots of their similar
pop-punk tracks making the
set feel bunched into one
unenthusiastic song. This
was evident with songs like
‘Hollywood Ending’ and
‘Tank Top’, although notable
songs that came across
incredibly well live included
‘Lizzy’, ‘She Gets Around’
and the Marc Bolan-inspired
riffage in ‘Pussy Tower’.
Starcrawler even treated us
to a rendition of their cover of
Ramones’ ‘Pet Sematary’, as
featured in the credits of the
latest remake of the Stephen
King classic. Finishing up
the set, ‘Train’ built up the
energy again to throw the
crowd into a frenzy, before
new hit ‘Bet My Brains’
closed up the show. Overall,
I left not feeling bowled
over, but I definitely hadn’t
wasted my time creeping
back to Underworld again.
