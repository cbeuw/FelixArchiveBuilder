olunteering for
a constituent
union comes
with a lot of
responsibility. Not only
do we oversee our own
operations, but also act
a management group for
multiple societies, in-
cluding the departmental
societies of our faculties.
Hell, my committee and
I have a duty to represent
the interests of all 3000+
natural sciences students.
All this being said,
you’d imagine that ICU
would ensure we’re
adequately prepared for
our roles. Maybe provide
me and my committee
with a bit of training and
ensure we at least had a
basic handover. As you
might’ve guessed from
the title of this article, that
never happened.
Don’t get me wrong,
ICU tried to get me
trained. They run a union
volunteer training session
called “Officer Academy”
at the end of the academic
year. Unfortunately, it was
on my final day of second
year exams, so I couldn’t
make it. To add insult to
Most of the planning for
Freshers’ fortnight occurs
over the break, and I had
absolutely no clue what
I was doing, but at least
I had my predecessor’s
handover to look forward
to, right?
Well, my handover
consisted of being led
into a study room, having
my responsibilities
quickly explained to me
(albeit with the aid of a
whiteboard), and a short
goodbye. And of course,
there was no handover
document, so if I forgot
something, then tough
titties.
Fortunately, with the
help of a few experienced
union volunteers, (thanks
again Lloyd, Michaela and
Aishy) I was able to learn
most of what I needed to
know. However, if I had
been less fortunate, Fresh-
er’s fortnight, or maybe
even the RCSU, might’ve
been an absolute mess.
There were other
incidents regarding a
failure to receive training.
Typically, constituent
union presidents are
invited to attend certain
sessions of the officer
trustee training. For some
unknown reason, we were
not invited this year. ICU
also planned a CU-presi-
dent-specific training day
near the beginning of this
academic year, but they
cancelled it a few days
before it could take place.
If ICU wants us to do
our jobs competently,
they should give us proper
training, not force us to
learn by trial and error,
or by asking the other
volunteers. Not only
is the current system a
nightmare, but it feels like
a goddam lottery, with the
grand prize being a decent
handover.
The strange thing is,
ICU should have a pretty
significant incentive to
train us. We are all serving
the same students, and if
the CUs do their jobs well,
they can take some of the
load off the ICU.
Given that we are
nearing the end of the
first term, the answer
to “When am I going to
be trained?” is probably
never. However, the
Union president, Abhijay
Sood, has promised to
improve the training for
next year, so I guess that’s
a plus. Time will tell if he
can deliver on this, and all
of his other promises.
Thanks for reading and
have a great week.
“Fresher’s
fortnight, or
maybe even
the RCSU,
might’ve been
an absolute
mess.”
injury, the next training
session was scheduled for
the 27th of September,
after the summer break
was practically over.
When am I going to be trained?
