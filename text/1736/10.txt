A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week, Felix sat down with Deputy President (Welfare) Shervin Sabeghi for a second interview, where we
discussed halls rent renegotiations(!) and chased up on the Liberation Reform and Disabilities History Month
Felix: One thing
which has been
making quite a bit
of noise is the halls
rent renegotiations.
This is something
that involves the
DPW heavily as it
impacts student
welfare heavily. What
are your thoughts
regarding the price
hike and the different
options, from a wel-
fare perspective?
For more details on the
situation thus far, see this
week’s News section.
SS: It goes deeper than
the obvious financial
implication of ‘rent higher
= difficult finances = bad
welfare’. The different
breakdowns of rent prices
across different halls can
have a big impact on the
student communities
living there, as well as
general accessibility to
the university.
One important change is
that the introduction of
Kemp Porter and closure
of Pembridge means
that the proportion of
students living in South
Kensington-centric halls
(Prince’s Gardens, Beit,
Wilson, Pembridge, etc.)
shifts from 73% to 51%,
with almost half the bed-
spaces being in Acton and
thus much further away.
We need to decide how
to deal with that – inde-
pendently of any overall
average price rises, there
would still be a discussion
around prices in different
halls with that shift and
the split of the student
body.
At the moment, the
Woodward halls are
effectively subsidised by
those in South Kensing-
ton. It was decided last
time these negotiations
came around that the ratio
between South Kensing-
ton and Acton halls would
be 2:1 in terms of price
per average square metres
of a room type (or, rather,
a similar metric to that.)
This ratio may need to
be readdressed, particu-
larly considering that the
proportion of students in
South Kensington versus
in Acton will shift so
drastically – rather than
three-quarters of students
providing a ‘subsidy’
to a quarter of students,
without change it would
become half subsidising
the other half. Combined
with the overall price
increase, that would likely
result in students in South
Kensington paying ridicu-
lously high rents.
However, reducing the
ratio too much may result
in there just being no low-
cost, more affordable halls
anywhere in the property
portfolio. Other factors
such as travel costs, which
comes out to around £22
per week for students in
Acton, also need to be
considered. Finding the
balance is something
we, as students, need to
discuss.
If the ratio is unchanged,
then taking into account
the overall increase in the
number of bedspaces after
the introduction of Kemp
Porter and closure of
Pembridge, the increase in
price on average has been
calculated to be around
12.2%.
But there are so many
factors to consider. For
example, equivalent
rooms in Southside are
around 5% more than
those in Eastside – and I’m
not sure historically why
that is, but we’re looking
at making that equivalent.
Equally, there are rooms
in both those halls which
look out on a wall instead
of onto Prince’s Gardens
and receive little sunlight
