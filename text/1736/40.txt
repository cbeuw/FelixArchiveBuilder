Advantages
What makes this new
type of bank special?
In broad terms, they
allow their customers
greater control over their
accounts. Particularly,
they notify their custom-
ers about the details of a
transaction immediately
after it has been complet-
ed. They also generate
monthly expenses reports
and forecasts about future
spending. One of the
most important features is
the ability to set savings
goals, which has now
been replicated in the
mobile applications of
their established com-
petitors. A large number
of customers also appre-
ciate the bill-splitting
feature which has proven
useful in several social
contexts. In terms of
currency exchange fees,
they differ significantly
from their conventional
rivals as they tend not to
charge commission for
transactions abroad. This
decision renders them sig-
nificantly more attractive
for customers wishing
to spend money outside
of their home country
without incurring fees
from mainstream banks.
Finally, certain challenger
banks allow their users
access to cryptocurrency
trading.
What about security?
The sign-up process
for these banks is just
as rigorous as that of
established institutions.
Upon creating an account,
users are asked to submit
a digital copy of their
passport or national
identity card as proof
of identity and provide
several identifying details,
such as their address,
amongst others. As far
as accessing an existing
account is concerned,
these newly created finan-
cial institutions offer the
highest safety standards
possible. Their authenti-
cation methods include
fingerprint scanning
along and facial and voice
recognition alongside the
regular PIN code. In the
event that a card has been
lost or stolen, customers
can login to their account
to immediately freeze it.
Needless to say, the card
can be unfrozen in the
exact same manner, if it
is recovered. Perhaps the
most important concern
potential customers will
have is: Can they trust
these banks with their
savings? These institu-
tions are regulated by
the Financial Services
Authority (FCA) and the
majority of them covered
by the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme
(FSCS), which guarantees
deposits up to £85,000.
Those wishing to create a
new account should defi-
nitely check whether the
provider they are interest-
ed in has gained regulato-
ry approval and access to
the FSCS. Months-long
delays have been observed
between the launch of
an app-only bank and its
receiving the pertinent
licence. Moreover, these

app-based banks tend to
partner with fully licensed
banks, which are the ones
that actually hold custom-
ers’ savings.
How do these chal-
lengers vary amongst
themselves?
Overtime,mostofthese
challenger banks seek to
emulate their traditional
competitors as closely as
possible. However, the
way they have started
their businesses has been
different as they have
sought to target their ap-
plications towards specific
audiences. On one hand,
there are those which
shine in international
money transfers. They
can be used in hundreds
of different currencies
and at a significantly
reduced cost compared to
high-street banks. Revolut
has been one of the most
prominent in this area. It
charges no extra fees for
global money transfers
and spending abroad and
also uses the Interbank
Exchange Rate, which
helps save consumers
even more. The Interbank
Exchange Rate is the rate
used by two banks to
transfer capital between
themselves. Banks tend
to charge a fee on top of
the rate used to make the
exchange, a trend that
Revolut has decided not to
embrace for transactions
between Monday and
Friday, when the currency
markets are open. On
the other hand, there
also exist those focused
on a more conventional
banking experience, such
as Starling. This kind
of upstart institutions
offer a current account
and usually, though not
always, pay interest on
their customers’ balance.
The list of services avail-
able typically includes
overdraft; challenger
banks clearly state what
fees they will charge
for using their overdraft
feature. In March 2017,
Starling launched the
UK’s first app-based
current account. Monzo
and Berlin-based N26
soon followed suit.
Another UK company,
Monese, can appeal to
foreign nationals and free-
lancers because it aims to
remove as many obstacles
as possible from the
account set-up process. It
lets people create a bank
account without needing

due to the regulations that
dictated the establishment
and operation of a bank.
Following the 2008 fi-
nancial crisis, regulatory
frameworks around the
world were significantly
overhauled. In the UK, the
2012 Financial Services
Act was written in a
way which enables new
companies to enter and
compete in the banking
industry. The changes in
legislation combined with
continuous technological
innovation led to the
set-up of a new type of
banks, which provide ser-
vices exclusively online
as they do not have local
branches. Customers use
mobile apps to manage
their accounts and can
receive support through
online chat. Most ‘es-
tablished’ startups now
provide customers with
a debit card, which has
the same characteristics
“In broad
terms, they
allow their
customers
greater control

accounts”
The figure demonstrates
that certain companies,
such as Revolut and
Curve, specialise in in-
ternational transactions,
while Starling, Monzo
and Atom Bank, among
others, emulate the func-
tionality of their domestic
competition.
What are the challeng-
es they face?
The most obvious diffi-
culty faced by a bank op-
erating based on a purely
digital infrastructure is
the reliability of said
infrastructure. Customers
cannot manage their
finances unless they are
connected to the Internet
via Wi-Fi or mobile data.
The December 2018 O2
outage demonstrated once
again that Internet access
should not be considered a
given. The number of cus-
