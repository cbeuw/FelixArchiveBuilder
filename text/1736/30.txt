s an avid fan
of all things
gaming, I love
to look over at
my wall and see stacks of
games lining the shelves.
From the Atari 2600 to the
Nintendo Switch, I love
them all; unfortunately,
I have a student budget
which does not come
close to fuelling my need
for games. Over the years,
though, I have learned
a multitude of ways of
getting as many games,
consoles, and peripherals
as possible with the limit-
ed cash in my wallet. This
week I will go over all of
these tips and tricks – as
well as which consoles
I recommend you start
collecting for, right now!
The first thing you need
to do before getting into
collecting is to decide
what you want to collect.
I like to collect physical
games, especially for
retro consoles, ‘complete
in box’ (which means
you have the game, box,
and instruction manual
all together). But that
isn’t the only thing you
can collect. Many people
I know enjoy collecting
consoles. The GameBoy
Advance, for example,
has more colours than I
can reasonably list here.
The 3DS has a plethora
of minor variations (2DS,
new 3DS and so on) that
could cover your entire
bookcase. Furthermore,
you could collect periph-
erals! Who remembers
the tennis rackets for the
Wii or, going even further
back, the GameBoy
Colour printer?! If you
want to collect games
you will also need the
consoles and peripherals
to play that game – but
beyond that the choice is
yours.
There are so many dif-
ferent consoles nowadays.
If you only include the
big three (XBOX, Play-
Station, and Nintendo),
and only include home
consoles, there are 14
unique consoles you could
purchase. Damn. Luckily,
if you are already into
gaming you likely have at
least one of these, so you
already know where to
start! You might as well
start by buying games for
a console you already own
– then you don’t have to
dump a load of cash on an
entirely new console.
If you are consider-
ing purchasing a new
console, I have a few
recommendations. The
PS3 is insanely cheap at
the moment, along with
its game library. It has
been officially dead for
a few years now, but the
upcoming PS5 releasing
in 2020 is rumoured to
be backwards compatible
with PS3 games. This will
result in a big price hike
for PS3 games when the
PS5 releases, so now is
the time to start collect-
ing! Another option is the
NES (Nintendo Entertain-
ment System), which was
Nintendo’s first true home
console (ignoring the col-
our-tv game from the 70s).
NES games are becoming
surprisingly affordable
recently, but are likely to
go up in price within a few
years as they become rarer
and rarer. Additionally,
the homebrew scene for
NES games is booming
at the moment, with
many different types of
games easily available to
purchase online. Together,
these two things mean it’s
the perfect time to corner
the NES market.
Once we have decided
what we are collecting
for, we then need to
know where we can find
them. There are many
options online. For new
games, you can simply
go to Amazon and order
them new, but there are
also plenty of options for
older games. The obvious
choice is eBay, a go-to
simply because it has
such a huge variety of
games available, as well
as having much more
reliable sellers. Facebook
marketplace can be a
good resource too, and
you can often find people
listing bundles of games
for WAY cheaper than
they are worth as they’re
unaware of the true value.
However, the issue
with purchasing online is
twofold. Firstly, it is very
easy to sell fake games.
As the value of retro
games climbs, it attracts
con-artists – scammers
are getting very good at
producing labels that look
almost identical to the true
products. I have fallen
prey to this before, pur-
chasing Pokémon Yellow
on eBay a couple of years
back only to receive it in
a fake box with a fake
cartridge. Secondly, pur-
chasing older games that
used cardboard boxes is
risky – if the seller does
not package it properly,
the box can get damaged
in transit, meaning your
newly-purchased near-
mint copy of Mega Man 2
could arrive as a crumpled
mess. It hurts my heart to
even type this.
Luckily, purchasing
games in person is also an
option. Granted, searching
in-person does not offer
the same seemingly un-
limited range and variety
that shopping online
provides, but the ability
to check out the game
and make sure it is legit
and undamaged gives any
buyer better ‘peace of
mind’.
For common games,
especially those after the
5th generation (the PS1
and N64 era), Computer
Exchange (CeX) is your
best friend. CeX is a chain
of shops specialising in
used video games and
electronics. There is
bound to be one within
walking distance of you,
with as many copies of
Wii Sports as you could
ever need. CeX has very
fair prices, and they make
sure all of their products
are in working condition –
with a warranty. The only
issue with CeX is that
they are lacking in a) rare
games, and b) older, retro
games.
For most people, then,
CeX is your best friend –
but if you’re like me and
enjoy diving into the rich
history of video games,
you’ll want to know
where to get the rare stuff.
For this, there are many
options. Charity shops
are always a good shout.
Although not commonly
found, sometimes you can
come across something
rare for significantly
less than it’s worth. I’m
talking Super Smash
Bros. Melee for £1. This
is because, for example,
many parents will simply
give away their children’s
games when they move
out of the house. Equally,
car boot sales are an
excellent choice. A few
years ago you could
find bucketfuls of rare
