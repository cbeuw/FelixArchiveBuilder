Exploitation of Animals in Wildlife Tourism
Behind the scenes, animals involved in the tourism industry often lead miserable lives, and just how miserable are
we talking here?

E
cotourism has
gained traction
in recent years,
focusing on
socially responsible travel
to destinations where
flora, fauna, and cultural
heritage are the main
attractions. Wildlife-
encounter tourism is not
a new phenomenon, but
thanks to social media it
has steadily gained pop-
ularity. Who amongst us
would not want to cuddle
a baby tiger, or ride upon
the back of an elephant?
That is, until the
illusion is dispersed; in
some institutions with
unscrupulous handlers,
tourists are oblivious to
the fact that many of the
captive animals have been
abused. Even more abhor-
rent is the discovery that
elephants at a resort in
Thailand, where elephants
can be seen roaming
freely, are the same ele-
phants that perform tricks
under the watchful eye of
their masters, sometimes
‘prompted’ with a sharp
metal stick, at another at-
traction mere miles away.
For all the visibility that
social media provides,
notably advertising
activities that were once
confined to guidebooks, it
doesn’t appear to encom-
pass the view beyond what
is initially portrayed. Most
tourists that enjoy a close
encounter with a tiger are
blissfully unaware that
they may be declawed,
drugged, or both. Or that
the abundance of cubs
waiting to be held and
cuddled have in fact been
bred at speed and snatched
from their mothers only a
few days after birth. Or
that the three performing
bears and their cubs at
the Bolshoi State St.
Petersburg Circus are kept
chained to a wall to force
them to become strong
enough to walk on their
hind legs.
The wildlife tourism
industry caters to the
public fascination with
wild animals and often
seeks to maximise profits
by exploiting animals
from birth until death.
Bottlenose dolphins are
integral to an industry
that spans the glove;
swim-with-dolphin insti-
tutions utilise dolphins
both caught in the wild
and bred in captivity to
interact with tourists.
The media increasingly
denounces aquatic
shows featuring dolphins
performing tricks, yet
many travellers are
photographed swimming
with captive dolphins at a
holiday resort, often in an
all-too-small pool.
There is controversy
surrounding whether
establishments with ‘high
standards’, including
pools filled with ocean
water and veterinarian
staff on-call, can be
considered humane for
marine life. The Humane
Society of the United
States argue that dolphins
have evolved to swim
vast distances and live in
complex social groups,
which cannot be repli-
cated in the confines of
an enclosed pool. Often,
these animals are placed
into unfamiliar groupings,
making communication
between them impossible.
Coupled with the
limited space, and bare
and sterile surroundings,
captive dolphins experi-
ence little mental stimu-
lation which frequently
sparks frustration, even
aggression.
Considering these
mammals possess in-
credible intelligence and
sentience and have been
documented on numerous
occasions engaging in
playful activities like flips

and leaps out of the water,
one begins to draw loose
parallels to human behav-
iour and consider whether
the same mistreatment
would be glossed over
in the mainstream media
if the subject in question
was a human?
