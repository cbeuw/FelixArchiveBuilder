Heartache for Hertfordshire

W
ith the
squeals and
whimpers
of the
Canterbury ‘players’ still
fresh on our minds, we
headed back to fortress
Harlington to kick off our
cup run. Today’s victims
were familiar faces, they’d
received a gentle 26-7
spanking a mere 5 weeks
ago, an experience they
were clearly unsatisfied
with. The naughty boys
had travelled far from
their quaint Hertfordshire
village, begging for a
firmer hand. We were only
too happy to oblige….
The game started well,
from the very first phase
Sochi’s fifth appendage
came swinging through
their back line, catching
both centres across the
cheek. A penalty lead to
an early lineout, driven
over the line by the valiant
forwards of ICURFC.
Hiding at the back of the
mall, I was able to claim
all the credit for the third
time this season. An easy
snipe for FAF followed
not too long after, it was
all going swimmingly.
Being the ‘take no shit’
‘bad boys’ of the South
Eastern BUCS leagues,
we inevitably gave away
a series of penalties.
Unfortunately, being too
handsome and doing
whatever the f**k we
want has its drawbacks
and saw us defending
a lineout just 5 metres
from our try line. After
winning approximately
ZERO lineouts in the last
game, Hertfordshire had
given up all conventional
tactics from the set piece.
A sneaky short ball and a
lapse of concentration, led
to the sweatiest of try’s,
lifting the opposition’s
spirit. We were deter-
mined to put them back in
their place.
After some sensual in-
terplay between our backs
the boys had quickly run
the ball out of our own
half with a single strike
play, putting Al Amino
over the line. Jealous of all
the attention, the forwards
followed suit, scoring
from yet another driving
maul. The tries just kept
coming, I’m watching the
recording and I still can’t
keep count. A particular
highlight has to be the
efforts of Air Marshal
Wheaton who had just
landed his single prop
pitch-side not 2 hours
before. Selflessly lurking
on the wing all game had
finally payed off when
he took off down the
touchline, leaving their
entire backline in the dust.
A final (and laughable)
attempt at a tap tackle
was shrugged off by the
fighter Ace, allowing him
substitute for the number
10 position, had spat his
dummy out. Not only had
he helped us answer the
age-old question ‘Who ate
all the pies?’, he was about
to bless us all with some
quality entertainment.
The ball had only
entered his orbit a handful
of times before he’d had
enough. His cheeks were
red raw, hot to the touch.
The open palm of the
Imperial men’s 1st XV
had struck one too many
times, the toys were firmly
out of the pram.
Despite attempting
to bully our honourable
scrum half all game,
Egor wasn’t happy about
Elliot’s reaction. “Don’t
touch me!” He whelped
(to a man the size of his
breakfast), scampering to
the other side of the field
with tears in his eyes. “I
said, don’t touch me!”
he exclaimed once again,
clearly misunderstanding
the definition of a ‘contact
sport’. The onslaught was
taking a toll, and it was
only about to get worse.
The pummelling
continued, what a sight it
was. The final score line
of 55-10 had us huffing
our own farts for the
second week in a row. The
smell of victory is sweet.
The defeated team left the
premises with mixed ex-
pressions. Most with a coy
smile, blissfully rubbing
sudocrem onto their
botties, having received
the treatment they’d come
for. Others hanging their
beer bellies in shame,
waved on by ICU’s finest
“See you in the new year
fellas!” *blows kiss*

severe defeat just 5 weeks before
