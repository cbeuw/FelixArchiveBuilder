Special Union Council Meeting - Halls Rent
The Union is currently negotiating the price of rent in halls with the
College, and we have a real opportunity to shape what the new model
could like. If you want your voice heard about this, join us at Union
Council on Tuesday 3 December, 19:00-20:00, in the Read Lecture
Theatre in the Sherfield Building, where we’ll be debating and deciding
on the best way to move forward.
The plan is for the President and Deputy President (Welfare) to present
the information they have and invite questions and contributions from
the floor, and then for elected student reps from across the College
to take a vote on the best option.
Please join us and make your voice heard! Let us know you will be
attending the meeting at imperialcollegeunion.org/halls-rent.
