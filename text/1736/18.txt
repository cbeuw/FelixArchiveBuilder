Hyde Park Winter
Wonderland Comedy Club
The Tiger Will See You
Now
B
e t w e e n
November and
December of
every year,
Winter Wonderland opens
its doors to Londoners
and tourists alike as one
of the most visited attrac-
tions. It has the perfect
atmosphere for just going
around the Christmas
markets and enjoying the
rides (of course while
drinking mulled wine) but
did you know that there
are Comedy Club shows
there?
Shows start at 9pm
and are 45 minutes long.
They take place from
Thursdays to Saturdays
from 21st November until
21st December, with a dif-
ferent comic lineup every
week.
For my visit, the lineup
consisted of Emmanuel
Sonubi as the host, while
Thomas Green and
Marcus Brigstocke were
the opening and the head-
lining acts respectively.
Sonubi was the
funniest by far, thanks
to his excellent engage-
ment with the audience.
His show focused on
satirical comments on
modern ‘language’ and
how certain words have
become forbidden over
the past decades.
Green, the pan Austral-
ian comedian based in the
UK, started by making
some friendly jokes that
compared the UK to
Australia. Then, he moved
on to tell funny, albeit pre-
dictable, stories and jokes
focusing on problems
within a relationship.
Brigstocke, the star
of the night, started by
bonding with the audience
by asking different
people’s nationalities
and made hilarious and
entertaining jokes for
each country mentioned.
This was really great
fun. He then talked about
the ‘division’ between
people in support and
in opposition of Brexit,
especially within his own
family. Unfortunately,
he could not keep the
momentum going, and
did not finish as well as
he started, ending his set
with cliched jokes about
marital relationships.
Generally, all the per-
formers were funny but
rather forgettable and pre-
dictable. It left me feeling
that the event was targeted
more towards tourists and
casual Winter Wonderland
visitors rather than regular
comedy club goers, which
led to the quality of
comedy suffering. Acts
refused to show person-
ality, instead opting for
cliche jokes dealing with
racism, politics, sexism
and relationship problems.
The attendees seemed
to enjoy themselves but
the price, fixed at £15 plus
transaction fees, is too
high for a 45-minute-long
comedy performance.
Nevertheless, the rest
of this year’s lineup looks
promising with plenty of
talented comedians set to
perform. If you end up at
Winter Wonderland one
of these coming weeks
and want to experience
something other than the
same old attractions, I
suggest you check out
the lineup for that day,
on Winter Wonderland’s
official website. Despite
the price tag, you might be
in for a very entertaining
45 minutes.
I
live with medics, and
from the way they
go on, one could be
forgiven for thinking
that the last thing that any
of them want is to be a
doctor. Which is why it
is so funny that the ICSM
medics chose to put on
Tiger Country last week
as their autumn play. This
is a play based on the as-
sumption that given how
difficult it is to become
a doctor, the only people
willing to give it a go are
the horrible, the neurotic
or the uncaring. I bet re-
hearsals were a real laugh.
“Right guys, let’s just
rerun the patient dying
from sepsis contracted as
a result of a surgical error
and the underfunded heart
attack unit scenes and
then we can go home and
do some anatomy!”
Thankfully the medics
took to their roles with
relish. This was what they
had been training for, in
some cases for 6 years
and boy, were they going
to show it. Patients were
lifted around by burly and
not so burly paramedics,
acronyms like OSAor F28
were thrown around willy
nilly and the cast seemed
to be having a genuinely
good time.
Astandout performance
from lead actress Vashti
(Eri Aung) who drew all
eyes to her whenever she
was on stage. Playing the
role of the highly compe-
tent but difficult surgeon
she came across as 8
feet tall despite probably
barely scraping 5 foot.
Her despair as she is
forced to choose between
the health of a relative
and her own career were
genuinely touching and
hard to watch.
The other notable per-
formance for me was Mr
Mercer the cancer sufferer
(Ehsaan Zaman) while not
present for long (thoughts
and prayers), his noble
resignation was sensitive
and mature.
While lacking energy
at points from certain
members of the ensemble,
the strength of the plot
and the leads drives the
story onwards to its sad
and cold conclusion.
Tiger country isn’t so
much about doctors as it
is doctor adjacent. It is
about people who have
been expected to care
about others for so long
and with such intensity
that many of them crack,
sinking into despair and
nihilism. The cast has a lot
to look forward to.
One final point: if
you were in the light
box on Thursday night
you should be ashamed
of yourself. The whole
audience could hear you
talking and laughing. You
let yourself and the actors
who had worked so hard
down.
