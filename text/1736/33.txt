Cybertruck Unveil
E
lon Musk an-
nounced Tesla’s
new electric
pickup truck -
Cybertruck. The physical
appearance of the truck
sure caught everyone off
guard. With a low-poly in-
spired futuristic aesthetic,
this truck challenges
the conventional design
of modern vehicles in
general, let alone pickup
trucks. While some may
regard it as ‘ugly’, others
view it as a fresh approach
and ultimately a brave
move by the company to
signal a new design trend
throughout the industry,
just like Apple did in
2016 by ditching the
headphone jack.
The reason for the
vehicle’s appearance is
because the body panels
are made of Ultra-Hard
30X Cold Rolled stain-
less-steel, which cannot
be stamped. Tesla claims
that the body is “made for
ultimate durability and
passenger protection.”
Tesla’s design chief
demonstrated its impact
resistance by swinging at
thrown at with heavy
metal balls during the
presentation.
The higher-end model,
with a triple motor setup,
has a 0-60 MPH time of
under 2.9 seconds, which
is absolutely ridiculous
for such a heavy pickup
truck, rather cybertruck!
More than improving
performance, the cyber-
truck aims to be the most
practical Tesla. Already in
high demand with more
than 200,000 reservations,
this vehicle is expected to
reach markets by the end
of 2022.
VR Headsets On Cows
Our recent past
expected a near future of
flying cars and personal
robot assistants, yet here
we are, sticking virtual
reality headsets on cows.
Fun aside, the headsets
are being used on cows
in the Moscow region
of Russia to simulate
a “calming summer
environment.” This re-
portedly has resulted in
decreased anxiety levels
and increased the overall
emotional mood. Inter-
estingly, this experiment
was not conducted by a
university, but rather by a
news site for the Russian
diary industry. Overall,
their aim is to test whether
this method contributes
positively to the yield.
Facebook Acquires
Beat Games
The developer behind
the highly popular game
Beat Saber, was acquired
by Facebook and eventu-
ally grouped under Face-
book’s Oculus Studios as
an independently oper-
ating developer, similar
to WhatsApp. With more
than one million copies
sold worldwide, the
rhythm game provides
an incredibly satisfying
experience as you smash
through blocks in tune
with the music. Following
the acquisition, the de-
veloper reported that the
game will continue to be
supported on all platforms
and that their 360 degree
levels are still on track for
a December release.
Android’s Ambient
Mode
Google is set to launch
Ambient Mode, which
effectively converts your
android smartphone into
a smart display when it’s
charging. The ambient
screen displays a set of
quick actions that help
you accomplish most
daily tasks through a
single tap. Alternatively,
the screen can be used as
a digital photo frame as
well as a control panel for
your smart-home devices.
Google assistant’s product
manager stated that “It’s
fundamentally about
moving from an app-
based way of doing things
to an intent-based way of
doing things.” This repre-
sents a new shift in how
general, everyday tasks
are tacked through your
android smartphones. He
also stated that since it’s
closely integrated with the
android operating system,
it’s not a standalone
feature. This “proactive
experience” is one of
many that are expected to
roll out in the future.
NASA’s ISS Robot
Trio: “Bumble”,“Hon-
ey”, &“Queen”
The International Space
Station receives a new
crew member - Honey, a
free-floating autonomous
robot. Honey and its
slightly older companion
Bumble are “Astrobee
robots”, which are aimed
at helping ISS astronauts
manage daily life tasks
and activities. If this
sounds similar, you’re not
wrong. The movie “In-
terstellar” depicts robots
helping astronauts as well,
albeit in a highly futuris-
tic and advanced way.
Another Astrobee robot,
named “Queen,” is set to
be activated soon. Apart
from helping astronauts,
these robots are tasked
with the immense respon-
sibility of maintaining the
station. The robots truly
mark an interesting step
towards human-robot
collaboration.
