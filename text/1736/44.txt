Nottingham Varsity Report
T
his might be
confusing, but
last Sunday the
IC Dance Club
competed at Nottingham
in Stoke. Held in
Stoke’s King’s Hall by
Nottingham University
(does it make sense now?),
the Nottingham Varsity is
the first major competition
on the university circuit. I
admit that very few great
days start at 3:45 in the
morning or feature Hilton
Park services, but once us
49 dancers (along with
thousands of sequins and
several gallons of hair
spray) had arrived, you
could feel the buzz in the
air.
There’s the entire
spread of university
dancers competing:
ex-students who’ve been
doing this sort of thing
for many years as well
as beginners who started
learning to dance about
five weeks earlier, but
everyone’s just as excited
as one another and eager
to compete.
Ballroom rounds take
up the morning, featuring
the elegant Waltz, the
passionate Tango, the
dizzying Viennese Waltz,
the smooth Foxtrot and
the speedy (duh!) Quick-
step. Bowen Kwan &
Man Qiu came second in
Pre-Intermediate, Fern
Hughes & Isabelle Wilson
came sixth in Intermedi-
ate as well as second in
the Same-Sex category
and Victor Solecki & Iris
Roatis came second in
Advanced.
We also had several
ex-student couples com-
peting such as Florian
Osterholzer & Avery
Koh who came fifth in
Ex-Student Beginner/
Novice and four (count
them four!) finalists in the
main Ex-Student com-
petition (Luca Florescu
& Stephanie Rathmann
(1st), Henry Hesten &
Sarah McMullan (2nd),
Matthew Abdul-Rahim &
Yue Shi (5th) and Alistair
McMurray & Izumi
Kurokawa (6th)). The
open Viennese Waltz was
also a strong competition
for us with two finalists
(Victor & Iris (2nd) and
Luca & Stephanie (3rd)).
Latin followed in the
afternoon, with the sharp
Cha Cha Cha, the fies-
ta-like Samba, the sensual
Rumba, the absolute bull
of the Paso Doble and the
kicky, flicky Jive. Bowen
& Man came third in
Novice and Jordan Kio
& Anastasia Sheptitskaya
came fourth in Advanced
whilst Ben Biggs & Zoe
McGee came sixth. Fern
& Isabelle made a third
final of the day and came
fourth in Same Sex.
Carsten Beck & Gaia
Young came fourth in
Ex-Student Beginner/
Novice and Christopher
Ho & Adela Capilnasiu
and Teodor Rusu &
Evgenia Agroti came first
and second respectively
in the main Ex-Student
competition. Christopher
& Adela also came second
in the open Paso Doble.
But that wasn’t the end.
Oh no, for in the evening
we had the Team Match.
We form up into teams
of four couples with
each couple dancing one
of the Waltz, Cha Cha
Cha, Quickstep and Jive.
Coming off the heels of
Blackpool in February
with an overall victory
(and a first placing for
our A-Team), the pressure
was on.
Our A-Team were vic-
torious for the second year
in a row at Nottingham/
Stoke defeating Cam-
bridge whilst just missing
out on the final were the
B-Team (8th) and the
C-Team (joint 9th). If we
can keep this up, we may
get another clean sheet
when it comes to team

matches throughout the
year.
We’re all looking
forward to next term with
three more competitions
(including Blackpool)
to defeat Cambridge at
(especially now that we
have a somewhat official
Varsity with them in the
form of the Liger Cup in
May).
Special thanks go to
Laura and Marika for
training us so well – we
certainly couldn’t have
done it without them.
