What Will the UK be Voting On?
Arts Editor Eamon Farhat gives his perspective on what the UK electorate thinks is important
COMMENT

O
n December
12th, the British
people will
vote, but who
and what are they voting
for? Are they voting for
thorough policies outlined
in a manifesto or headline
ideas performed on TV?
Is it about the local candi-
date in their constituency
or the celebrity like figure
who leads that party?
This week, the election
campaign has trudged
on and some important
events have taken place:
TV debates and manifesto
launches. We have had the
first of a series of debates
and interviews with party
leaders going head to
head, under the spotlight
for millions at home to
see. We have also been
treated with hundreds of
pages of manifestos to not
read from all the major
parties, outlining policies
and pledges.
For politicians, these
manifestos might seem
hugely important and it is
true that key policies in the
past have swayed voters
but in a post-truth era, is
this all changing? Many
voters do not believe a
word a politician says,
writes or even carves onto
a stone tablet. This does
not necessarily mean that
they won’t vote for them,
but whether they pledge
10 or 100 billion on the
NHS, the voters will take
it all with a pinch of salt.
This is partially due to the
fact that so many election
pledges in recent years
have been broken. These
broken promises range
When voters put their X
in the box on a cold night
in December, it won’t be a
Party or a manifesto they
are voting for but a local
candidate. Most people
take little notice of this
person and look instead
at the party leaders. These
are the people who could
become our nations prime
minister. For some, it
is the qualities of this
person, whether it be
leadership or trustworthi-
ness, that matters most.
All the leaders will use
their public appearances
and TV performances to
try and shine a light on
these characteristics. For
example Boris Johnson re-
peating his Brexit mantra
35 million times to show
he is a man of conviction.
Jo Swinson showing
strong leadership… of
her finger as she presses
the red button for nuclear
annihilation. The way the
leaders interact with the
moderators, audience and
of course their opponents
gives a unique insight into
their temperament. Even
when asked the toughest
questions, will they keep
their cool?
Despite the temptation
of focusing on circus of
all of it, I believe a party
should be judged on its
policies past, present and
future. The manifestoes
help paint part of the
but must be put into
held by the Conservative
leader. Furthermore, the
rampant spreading of fake
news and the tendency to
understate the truth by top
politicians is definitely
something to watch out
for. Trustworthiness is
becoming a rare thing,
but we must not accept
to be fed straight lies and
must reject anyone who
peddles them.
Overall, this election
should be about a wide
range of policies and the
general direction that
different parties want to
push the country towards.
For example, Labour
pledge 28 pounds for
every pound the Tories do
towards public services.
Reading manifestos in
the context of the party’s
past performance is key
to do this. As the media
whips of a storm about
each leader’s performance
during interviews and
debates, it is important to
take a step back and really
remember that policy is
always more important
than this pageantry. The
next leader of our nation
Finally, a political piece
written in the post-Cam-
eron era would not be
complete without a little
mention of Brexit. This
election is of course being
viewed by some as a qua-
si-referendum, and thus
for them all that matters
is a party’s position on
Brexit. Not what the
manifesto outlines on
paper or what the leader
says on stage. Although I
believe that Brexit should
play a part in the decision,
it should only be part of a
bigger picture when deter-
mining who to vote for.

context with the party’s
recent history. However,
does this mean that the
behaviour and character-
istics of each leader is not
important? I do believe
that in the current age of
popularism, these factors
are often overstated but
there is some weight that
should be given to them.
The language and rhetoric
used by the leaders is defi-
nitelyone.BorisJohnson’s
comments about Muslim
women looking like letter
boxes and bank robbers
or calling members of
the LGBTQ+ community
bum boys are examples.
These are not policies,
but rather point towards
the beliefs and values
from university tuition
fees to the NHS, and from
immigration targets to air
quality. Wide reaching
broken promises mean
that trust has been broken
across all demographics.
This dangerous cycle
is self-fulfilling. As less
people believe pledges,
the less politicians will
work to complete their
pledges. If the public
already believes the
policies will never be
carried through, the reper-
cussions for that are not
as harsh. For this reason,
I believe it is really im-
portant to read manifestos
and try to understand what
areas different parties put
importance on.
