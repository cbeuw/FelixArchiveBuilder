Reimagined, Redesigned, and Revamped
It makes up part of the scenery at Imperial, sitting just a right turn out of the South Kensington tube station on
Exhibition Road, but the Science Museum’s latest gallery is more than just background viewing

E
arlier this month,
the Science
Museum un-
veiled their latest
exhibition, ‘Medicine: the
Wellcome Collection’, a
gallery that, put simply,
showcases the history
of medicine, taking up
3000 square metres of
space, spanning over 500
years of history right up
to the present day, and
presenting with a global
reach. More accurately,
though, it is a collection
of stories that spotlight
both the people practising
medicine or driving for-
wards its advancement,
and those on the receiving
end who have profound
experiences to share.
Science Museum
veterans might recall
the previous medical
history gallery which was
displayed in specific time-
bound periods, such as
medicine in the war era.
This new gallery takes
the best of the old but is
completely reimagined,
redesigned, and revamped
with items from the
world’s most extensive
medical archive: the
Wellcome collection.
Reimagined
“We wanted to take
a new approach.” Katie
Baumer, Curator of
Medicine at the Science
Museum, explains the
Museum’s masterplan.
“We’ve gone for a more
thematic exploration of
our collection and the
history of medicine... So:
our exploration of the
body, our development of
treatments, and looking
from a community scale
of how we deal with
medicine as a society.”
This thematic pres-
entation is powerful, with
items like an alchemist’s
glassware for boiling up
batches of urine placed
in the same cabinet as a
modern-day toxicologist’s
autosampler, used to run
blood and urine samples
on for the detection of
drugs. Advertisements
for cigarettes over the
last century are displayed
side-by-side, showing
changes in public percep-
tion of the health risks of
smoking.
The chosen themes
seem to suit the
fast-changing, and
arguably, more scientifi-
cally complex advances
of the recent time period
than perhaps a traditional
chronological display
would, allowing develop-
ments in instrumentation
for understanding disease
or human health to be
showcased. There’s
X-ray crystallography,
DNA sequencing, and
electroencephalography
(ECGs) – by grouping
into subthemes such as
‘seeing’ or ‘measuring’,
the generalist visitor can
understand the technique
as an extension of more
familiar ways of seeing
and measuring. And for
those of you who thought
physiology dominates
medical history, it’s grati-
fying to see the advances
in fields like biochemis-
try, molecular biology,
toxicology or analytical
chemistry take a bow!
Redesigned
The exhibition is not
just redeveloped in space,
but also redesigned in
expression. This gallery
incorporates various in-
teractive and multimedia
elements, including a
‘battle the virus’ game
station and a Victorian
Pharmacy you can enter
and ‘shop’ round. But for
me, the most compelling
were the videos and
audio tapes of individuals
telling their own stories,
such as Caroline Presho,
who discovered she had
the BRCA 2 gene (which
increases her risk of
developing breast cancer
later in life), and chose
to undergo a preventative
double mastectomy.
Strong stuff – especially
when I realised the nearby
cabinet displayed a cast
of her breasts before the
mastectomy.
It is really something to
experience the exhibition
from within pockets of
personal stories – and
there are many more than
Caroline’s to hear. In fact,
the whole exhibition is
connected by the strong
sense of community and
how we as individuals
interact with medicine and
healthcare. The emotional
journeys we go through
in health scares or battles
with disease can generate
as much hope and fear as
a religion inspires, and
this sense comes through
in many of the stories on
offer.
Revamped
The history of medicine
has a few staple facts that
always get trotted out; the
invention of penicillin
by Alexander Fleming,
the first vaccination for
smallpox by Edward
Jenner, the discovery of
the double helix of DNA
by Watson and Crick (and
Rosalind Franklin’s data,
as we now know) – as
Baumer calls them, the
‘big boys’.
But my favourite part
of the exhibition was the
wealth of new stories
it tells – and stories of
women. Those big boys
are still there, but they
aren’t, for once, the focus
of their cabinets. Instead,
they are joined by a litany
of women counterparts.
So, when you visit, you
might need to make room
in your famous female
scientist list, right there,
between Marie Curie and
Florence Nightingale.
Now you can add the two
X-ray sisters, Edith and
Florence Stones, who
made their own way to
the frontline in WWI with
mobile X-ray machines
after being denied entry
into the Red Cross on
grounds of gender; and
Dorothy Hogkins, whose
work in X-ray crystal-
lography was key in
determining the structure
of insulin and advanc-
ing diabetes treatment.
There’s the American
Mary Jacobi who dis-
proved the prevailing
theory that women’s
pulses weakened during
menstruation. Or Edith
Widdowson, who took it
upon herself to undergo
extreme diet experiments
to support the Govern-
ment’s wartime food
ration policies.
It was my personal
favourite, however, that
really struck home; brain
specialists Vivian Davey
and her husband William
Walter, who built the
first autonomous robots
modelled on the human
brain. To see the descrip-
tion written that way
made me hopeful that this
generation of children
brought to the Science
Museum on school trips
or family fun days would
grow up seeing both men
and women they could
connect with in their ex-
perience of science.
Re-visit
I’m sure the Science
Museum is a regular
trip for many Imperial
students, given its prox-
imity, and of course a few
other vital student quali-
ties like being dry, warm,
and most importantly,
free. But even if it wasn’t,
I’d highly recommend the
next time you come out of
the tunnel on Exhibition
Road, make a right turn
– the Science Museum
certainly has.
