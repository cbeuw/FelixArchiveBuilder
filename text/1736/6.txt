Union Kitchen Receives 2/5 Food Hygiene Rating
An inspection undertaken in August found that hygienic food handling was not up to par in the 568 kitchens

T
he Union kitchen
has received a
low 2-out-of-5
rating for their
food hygiene, after an in-
spection by a local council
Environmental Health
Officer (EHO) took place
on August 23rd.
The areas assessed
were hygienic food
handling, cleanliness and
condition of facilities,
and management of food
safety. While the latter
two were considered
“generally satisfacto-
ry”, the hygienic food
handling was described
with “improvement nec-
essary” and influenced the
low overall score.
The officer found
mice within the Union
bar and cockroaches in
the kitchen, which were
gaining access via gaps
and cracks in the building
as a result of age. Despite
the pest problems high-
lighted in the report, the
Union has stressed that
this was not the cause of
the kitchen closure, which
was instead related to
electrical faults.
Other issues highlight-
ed during the inspection
are currently unknown,
though Felix should
obtain the report written
by the officer in the
coming days.
Julia Mattingley, the
Head of Commercial
Services at the Union,
clarified that some of the
issues raised in the report
were not fully valid – crit-
icisms that were levied
had, in fact, already been
addressed,butcouldnotbe
evidenced at the time. The
EHO was accompanied
during the inspection by
an agency-hired interim
Head Chef, covering for a
long period of sickness on
behalf of the permanent
Head Chef, and a perma-
nent member of Union
staff. Both have now left
the Union. The interim
Head Chef was appar-
ently unaware of certain
processes that had been
established, for which the
Union was marked down
– inaccurately, they claim.
The unfit state of the
kitchen is, Julia said, par-
tially down to dependence
on agency staff – describ-
ing some of the interim
Head Chefs that have been
in place as “downright
unsuitable”, and noting
that even in the case that
they are not, agency staff
are often transient.
“We have had some
really fantastic and
hard-working agency staff
and similarly we have had
some very poor agency
staff who didn’t care
much and didn’t control
things in the way that we
would have liked. This,
unfortunately, can be the
attitude of some transient
workers who are here
today and gone tomorrow.
The level of account-
ability from an agency
chef can be different from
a permanent member of
staff as there is nothing
to stop the agency worker
leaving and not coming
back at any point.”
The Union is taking
extensive action to rectify
the raised issues, both
with regards to the EHO
inspection and the electri-
cal faults. In both cases,
they are working closely
with the College’s Estates
division, as building in-
frastructure maintenance
falls under their remit.
A deep clean of the
space and the organisa-
tion of regular visits by
Rentokil – pest extermina-
tors – is being organised,
as well as a large-scale
project to plug the various
gaps in the building that
were allowing access.
Currently, most of those in
the bar area have already
been tackled.
With regard to the
electrical faults which
caused the kitchen
closure, specific details
have been revealed. The
circuit board could not
carry the full electrical
load of the set of appli-
ances being used in the
kitchen, thus activating
the trip switches – which,
across the circuit board,
were only described with
unclear or outdated label-
ling. The labelling is now
being renewed.
Additionally, all
the equipment is now
receiving tests from the
Estates teams to ensure
their electrical safety
– however, the heavi-
est-duty appliances need
specialist equipment to
test, extending the length
of the process. Additional-
ly, the overall provision of
electrical infrastructure is
being assessed, including
testing sockets to ensure
they work, checking that
there are enough sockets
to appropriately handle
the amount of equipment
being used, and that they
are located in safe places
around the kitchen.
On the administrative
and staffing side, refresher
training is being delivered
to staff, staff records are
being updated, and assess-
ments of health and safety
paperwork are being
conducted.
The extent of these
assessments means that
the Union kitchen will be
closed for the remainder
of term, but Julia stresses
the importance of ensuring
everything is fully up-to-
scratch before returning to
business. “Unfortunately
this is not a five minute
job and we need to ensure
that everything is done
properly before reopen-
ing.”
