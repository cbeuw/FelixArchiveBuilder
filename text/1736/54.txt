O
n Sunday 17th
November, a
rowdy group of
56 of Imperial’s
finest specimens woke
up in the wee hours to
catch their 6:36 train from
London Bridge. While
most would cringe at
the idea of such an early
wakke-up on their rest
day, the ICXCAC runners
all rose to the challenge
and (nearly all) made it on
time as it marked the be-
ginning of a very special
day in the club’s tradi-
tions: the Brighton 10k:
a flat and fast race on the
seafront with a main out-
and-back loop followed
by a 1.5km out-and-back
finish which provides all
the runners with relentless
encouragement from their
teammates, regardless of
their position in the race.
While some finished
(and others just began)
their night on the train to
the seaside town, the sun
rose and started shining
upon the athlete’s game
faces. With a habit of
breaking PBs at this
event, and perfect race
conditions on the day, all
were ready to put in strong
performances.
Heading to the Bright
Helm Wetherspoons first
to get changed, have one
(or two) last coffees and
loo stops, the team then
set out to the waterfront to
drop their bags, get their
face paint on and warm up
for the main event.
At 9:30, the gunshot
signalled the start of
the competition and the
1500-strong crowd hit the
tarmac and the fierce race
was on.
The boys were led
by super-speedy Niki
Faulkner who managed a
rapid 32:19 to take overall
12th in the race, hot on
his heels was captain,
Henry Hart, with 32:44
and an overall 15th spot.
Mihaly came in just 10
seconds behind. Tour Sec
Misy also came in an
outstanding 25th place
in a blistering 33:36!
Treasurer Tom Bayley ws
next in for the men in 46th
place in 34:45, followed
by Euan Bell in 54th place
in 35:07, just a second
ahead of men’s captain
Charlie McFadzean!
First of ICXCAC’s
girls was Women’s
Captain Georgia Curry
who adds to her strong
season by nailing a 10km
PB with 36:50 and also
took overall 9th Women.
Sarah Johnson came in
close behind in 36:58,
followed by Social Sec-
retary and rising star Alix
Vermeulen in 38:18.
Catherin Spurin
finished in 42:20, gaining
a 10km PB which means
she’s managed to PB at
5km, 10km, half-mara,
mara and ultra this year -
no mean feat!
Other notable perfor-
mances include Jessica
Dring-Morris who
smashed her 45 minute
target by coming across
the line in 42:46. As well
as Charlotte Barratt who
succeeded on the negative
splits, finishing the race
with a 4:10min/km to
come across the line in
44:47!
In the alumni, Chris
Thomas put in an ex-
traordinary performance
coming 5th overall in a
also featured a new 5km
PB!
After a nice lunch,
some rest, a few pints
and a swim in the sea
for the most courageous,
the team headed home
mid-afternoon, feeling
content from this very
successful day.
Brighton rounded off
a cracking Autumn term
for our team with strong
efforts both in training and
at races from all 200 (and
growing...) members.
