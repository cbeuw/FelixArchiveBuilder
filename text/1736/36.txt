General Election 2019: What are the environmental
policies and promises of the parties?
T
he public concern
towards environ-
mental issues are
at a peak, and this
is reflected in the mani-
festos of political parties,
which have a heavier
focus on environmental
policies than those of pre-
vious years.
As manifestos are
long and hard to navigate
through, I have picked out
relevant environmental
information from the main
parties of Conservatives,
Labour, Liberal Demo-
crats, and Green. To keep
things concise, I have
not included the DUP,
SNP, and Plaid Cymru,
although they do discuss
environmental issues in
their manifestos, so please
read about it especially
if you have the choice
to vote for those parties.
The objective of this
article is to summarise the
environmental policies
and promises of the dif-
ferent political parties in
a non-biased way. Please
do keep in mind that the
manifestos aim to appeal
to the eco-conscious
voters, and whether they
actually deliver on their
promises is uncertain for
sure. It would definitely
be great to do further
research on the track
record of the parties as
well as the individual
MPs you are voting for.
The summary of proposed
plans to target climate
change are as follows:
Conservatives
Reach Net Zero green-
house gas emission by
2050 with investment in
clean energy solutions
and green infrastructure
to reduce carbon emis-
sions and pollution.
In the Costing document
it is said that there will
be £640 million capital
spending on Nature for
Climate Fund over five-
year period.
Support environmentally
friendly homes that have
low energy bills and line
all new streets with trees.
• Moratorium of fracking
(a pause rather than a
ban). The manifesto stated
that the Conservatives
“will not support fracking
unless the science shows
categorically that it can be
done safely.”
• Support gas for
hydrogen production and
nuclear energy, alongside
increasing commitment
to renewables. Aim for
offshore wind industry to
reach 40GW by 2030
• Use the UN Climate
