their oil dependence and

reduces, their economy
could shatter if there were

In recent years,
Chinese economic growth
has slowed, and Chinese
foreign investment has
sunk worldwide, except in
the Middle East. In 2007,
the Middle East contribut-
ed to only 1% of Chinese
foreign investments, but
now, China has become
the Middle East’s largest
investor, with 1 in every
3 euros invested being
Chinese. To China, the
strategic importance of the
Middle East is of utmost
importance - it holds 48%
of global oil reserves and
40% of global natural gas
reserves. The Chinese
plan to topple American
dominance of Middle East
has two main parts.
The ﬁrst is seen in the
investment strategy China
commonly uses to create
economic interdepend-
ence, through schemes
such as the Belt and
Road Initiative, to give
themselves leverage over
other nations. Investment

The Chinese government has created the Petroyuan system to compete with the
American Petrodollar // Nikkei Asian Review
global superpower.
This new Chinese
approach comes at a time
where the United States
is profoundly altering its
Middle Eastern strategy.
Both the Obama and
Trump administrations
have wanted to lessen
American dependence on
OPEC oil, lower military
presence in the region
and rather prioritise its
focus on the Asia-Paciﬁc
region. The United States
has reduced the number of
troops in nearly all parts
of the region – with an
exception to SaudiArabia,
who it has pledged to
protect.
Moreover, the United
States has tried to reduce
its dependence on foreign
oil. In 2007, it imported
12 billion barrels of oil
per day, whereas in 2017 it
imported 2 billion barrels
of foreign oil per day.
Recently it became a net
oil exporter, competing
with the Middle Eastern
oil giants.
The US increasingly
views the Middle East as a
strategic defence location,
and China is attempting to
ﬁll in America’s position
as the dominant power
in the Middle East for 2
reasons; to secure its oil
sources and for strategic
purposes for shipping.
The port of Duqm is also
currently receiving US
and Indian investment.
Moreover, having a port
in Duqm and a trade
route into the Middle East
can potentially reduce
Chinese dependence on
shipping in the Indian
Ocean, in which China’s
access can be blocked by
the USA and India, the
two main naval powers
in the Indian Ocean.
Increased inﬂuence in
the global oil trade would
empower Beijing and give
it leverage over rivals
such as India – a country
which is currently seeing
faster economic growth
than China – who also
depend on oil imports.
In conclusion, if more
countries switch to the
Petroyuan system, the
inﬂuence and global
dominance of the United
States of America will
greatly decrease while
Chinese soft power would
grow. This would impact
everyone in the world in
nearly all aspects of life;
from international laws
and regulation, to leverage
on freedom of speech and
media freedoms. The
endgame on who becomes
the dominant power of
the 21st century may be
dependent on decisions
by OPEC on whether to
cease or continue trading
oil in dollars. For better
or worse, the world as we
know it will change.
infrastructure, business
partnerships and the sale
of military technology.
In Middle East, the
Chinese government-con-
trolled SINOPEC and
oil behemoth Saudi
ARAMCO has a joint
venture to build a $10
billion oil reﬁnery, and
a similar reﬁnery is also
being built in cooperation
with the Government of
Kuwait. However, the
largest Chinese invest-
ment is in Oman. The city
of Duqm, only a decade
ago it was a small ﬁshing
town with a population
with 5,100. However, it
is expected to grow to
100,000 by 2020 due to
increasing foreign invest-
ment by China, USA and
India. The Chinese will
create infrastructure such
as highways, buildings
and build a port in the
area, which will signif-
icantly beneﬁt Oman’s
economy. However, it is
of greater beneﬁt to China
as it provides a location
which avoids the Strait of
Hormuz, which is an in-
creasingly unstable body
of water due to Iranian
seizures of oil tankers.
Secondly, in addition
to creating links with the
Middle East, China is
attempting to create an
oil trading the Petroyuan,
to compete with and
topple the Petrodollar.
Trump:“Does the USA want to
be the Policeman of the Middle
East getting NOTHING but
spending precious lives and
trillions of dollars protecting
others who, in almost all cases,
do not appreciate what we are
doing? Do we want to be there
forever? Time for others to
finally fight”

Currently the Yuan has
very little inﬂuence on the
world in comparison to
the Dollar and the Euro.
This is primarily due to
the high liquidity of the
Yuan and the low trust in
the Chinese legal system
which scores in the bottom
20 in the world in the WJP
Open Government Index,
which ranks legal systems
of nearly every country
in the world (the USA
scores in the global top 15
in comparison). Nonethe-
less, the Chinese govern-
ment is trying to tempt
more countries into using
this alternative system
by making the Petroyuan
a gold backed currency,
with options to fully
exchange Petroyuan to
gold in both the Shanghai
and Hong Kong exchang-
es. Additionally, countries
facing US sanctions can
avoid them by switching
to the Petroyuan. So far,
4 countries have started
to use this system; Iran,
Russia, Venezuela and
Angola, all countries that
have been sanctioned for
reasons political reasons
and human rights abuses.
This escape from US
sanctions and being a gold
backed form of currency
are very attractive to
many countries. This new
system – if successful
– would enable China
to grow their slowing
economy and allow it
the same privileges that
the US has seen with its
Petrodollar system, po-
tentially making China a
