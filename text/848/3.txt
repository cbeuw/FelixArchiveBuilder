Summer Breeze
Gate Theatre,
Notting Hill Gate.
Runs 'til 18th Nov
The British Premier of Arthur Schnitzler's play Im Spiel
der Zommerflute shows Glynis (Dempsey and
Makepeace) Barber in the part of a cooly played
jealous wife, who suspects her absent husband of
having it away with Viennese ladies whilst on
business. Meanwhile, his son and his nubile
nymphomaniac niece wind up having it away in an
isolated mountain hut—"It was pouring with rain, so
I just had to stay there with Edward....he showed me
his botany set."-and the characters generally vie
with one another until the news of an impending duel
brings things to a logical conclusion.
Schnitzler was a Doctor of Psychology, and his
works display the twitchings and vibrations of the
human psyche with a tenderness and compassion
which lend a sense of humour and some witty
moments, as well as a perceptive accuracy.
A strong cast turn in some fine performances, and
you leave the Gate Theatre feeling both entertained
and stimulated. If you haven't seen anything on the
London Fringe before, this venue above the Prince
Albert Pub at Notting Hill has to be an excellent
example of decent theatre at some very affordable
prices. Summer Breeze runs until 18th November.

Cult competition
This week's contest features the names and places
appearing in the soon to be released fourth paperback
volume in master storyteller L Ron Hubbard's 'Mission
Earth Series'. It's entitled 'An Alien Affair'. Narrated
by the alien killer who travelled 22 light years to seal
the fate of Earth. 'An Alien Affair' races non-stop from
a deadly Long Island speedway to the extraterrestrials'
secret base in Turkey, from a battle on an observation
platform of the Empire State building to the bizarre
pleasures in the basement apartment of the sadistic
Miss Pinch.
In this competition the first five winning entries will
receive three paperback volumes of this story by L
Ron Hubbard.
