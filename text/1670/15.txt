The story of one life, and another, and another, and
another
I
n 4321, Paul Auster
sets out his main
hypothesis on the
second page. He’s
telling the tale of Isaac
Reznikoff, a European
Jewish immigrant who
moves to America at the
turn of the century, and
is bestowed the name
Ichabod Ferguson by an
immigration official at
Ellis Island. A kind of
immigrant-everyman, his
life is tough, and money
is tight, and so the only
things he can give his
family are stories about
“the vagabond adventures
of his youth.” “In the long
run,” Auster writes, “sto-
ries are probably no less
valuable than money, but
in the short run they have
their decided limitations”.
If this is the case,
and written words are
as valuable as dollars
and cents, then 4321 is a
bullion. A tombstone of a
novel, it stands at nearly
900 pages long, complete-
ly impractical for reading
on the move. Throughout
the course of the novel,
Auster takes us through
the early life of Archibald
Ferguson, the grandson of
Ichabod, who grows up in
the New Jersey-New York
area in the 1950s and 60s.
Or rather, he takes us
through the early lives of
Ferguson, since from the
off the timeline is disrupt-
ed, with four Fergusons
diverging off from each
other in parallel, their
experiences all slightly
different. Early trials
and tribulations play a
larger role in how the
Fergusons develop than
later developments, and
symmetries and patterns
develop between the four
timelines. The Schneider-
man family, for instance,
play a key role in each
narrative, but each time
different members come
to prominence; Amy Sch-
4321 subverts the tired
trope of the ‘immigrant
novel’, turning around
the idea that any individ-
ual story of hardship can
encapsulate 20th
Century
American life. If one were
to separate out the four
timelines of 4321, and
present each as a short
novel, then each could
probably be described
as ‘a microcosm of the
mid-century USA’ – by
presenting them together
Auster reveals how hollow
such platitudes ring.
When Auster was 14,
he himself had an early
brush with death, coming
narrowly close to a light-
ning strike that killed the
boy next to him. This has
clear influences on 4321,
with the title becoming a
countdown of Fergusons
remaining as the others
shuffle off their mortal
coil. The first of these
comes less than half way
through the book – a
dramatic shock that is
intensified by the blank
chapters that take up the
rest of that character’s
narrative, which function
as a bleak epitaph.
Auster draws on his
own experiences at
other points too: three of
his Fergusons become
writers – in a variety of
disciplines – and two
write books that are direct
copies of the lines Auster
had written earlier on in
the novel. These kind of
metafictional twists are
what Auster does best, and
4321 is no different.
As an exercise in meta-
fiction, Auster’s intention
is clear, but 4321 still
manages to hold up as
a straightforward piece
of fiction – an excellent
thing, since it makes up
for the wrist strain ex-
perienced from carrying
around the tome. With
lengthy, verbose sentences
that run into each other in
a delirious train of descrip-
tion, Auster contemplates
a number of big themes,
centring around the Jewish
mid-20th
Century experi-
ence, and the special place
New York – “the capital of
human faces, a horizontal
Babel of human tongues”
– has in that milieu.
Philip Roth’s 1997
masterpiece American
Pastoral takes on similar
themes, but while Roth’s
narrative is darker, and
goes further forward into
the paranoiac decade of
the 1970s, 4321 remains
relatively buoyant. The
action plays out against a
backdrop of the turmoil of
the 1960s, with the killing
of Martin Luther King, the
1967 Newark riots, and
the 1968 Columbia Uni-
versity protests cropping
up – the casual anti-sem-
itism of WASP America
makes an impact, causing
one Ferguson to reflect
that “until that moment
it had never occurred to
him that he might not be
an American, or, more
precisely, that his way of
being an American was
any less authentic” – but
the Fergusons move
through relatively un-
scathed, and their world
views remain remarkably
similar, despite their dif-
ferent life experiences.
Auster’s sentences are
a delight to read, but can
have a tendency to veer
into self-parody. Consider
this one:
“As Ferguson listened
to Amy defend New York,
declare her love of New
York, it occurred to him
that she herself was
somehow an embodiment
of her city, not only in her
confidence and quickness
of her mind but also and
especially in her voice,
which was the voice of
brainy Jewish girls from
Brooklyn, Queens, and
the Upper West Side, the
third-generation New York
Jewish voice...”
The sentence then con-
tinues for the remainder
of the page, and while it
is beautiful, it is one of a
number of moments where
you feelAuster might have
required a firmer editing
hand. Similar issues crop
up towards the end of the
novel, where things come
together a bit too neatly –
the threads of destiny are
tied together by Auster
in a way that, to me,
came across as trite. That
being said, 4321 remains
a powerful experience –
Auster has managed to
sustain a simple conceit
through an epic length,
thanks to his powerhouse
control of the written
word. In the long run,
that is definitely worth its
weight in gold.
