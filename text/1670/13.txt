Alternative Music Society Recommends An Album
Time by Electric Light Orchestra is a retrofuturistic classic, a time-travel epic that still feels fresh in 2017
T
om Petty sadly
passed away this
week, aged 66.
He was prolific,
both as a solo artist and
within groups. One nota-
ble side project of his was
the Travelling Wilburys,
a late eighties supergroup
with a stellar line up of
Petty, Jeff Lynne, Bob
Dylan, George Harrison
and Roy Orbison. Some
years earlier, however,
Jeff Lynne was doing his
own thing as the frontman
and lead songwriter of
symphonic pop group
Electric Light Orchestra.
Picture the scene: it’s
1981, Lynne has just heard
that people are making
music using computers
now, and he wants in. With
all this new-fangled, fu-
turistic technology at their
fingertips, the natural thing
to do, of course, is to write
a concept album about
a man plucked from the
80s and forcibly dropped
in the year 2095 with
no way of getting back.
With this comes a new
space-agesound;takingin-
spiration from the likes of
OMD and Human League,
this album sees ELO
dropping their distinctive
orchestral whimsicalities
in favour of synth-pop,
robot voices and strange
intermittent bleep-blops.
Goodbye, Mr Blue Sky.
What’s stranger still
Nights to get your heart racing: London’s DnB scene
habit, I do suggest you
hang out in the smoking
area, a natural congre-
gating area for artists
and like-minded people.

for this gig yet, but it’s
a free rave on a Friday
night in a venue with
very few sound restric-

is that, somehow, it
really works. From the
thunderous wonderment
of ‘Twilight’ to the aches
and longing of ‘Ticket to
the Moon’, the narrative
is strong, endearing, and
full of comically dated de-
scriptions of tomorrow’s
world. In ‘Yours Truly,
2095’, our protagonist
says of his new robotic
girlfriend “I met someone
who looks a lot like you
/ she does the things you
do / but she is an IBM”.
Welcome to the future,
ladies and gentleman.
And despite the sty-
listic sidestep, the sound
is still glazed with the
beautiful layers of intri-
cate Beatlesque pop for
which ELO are known
and loved. A sonic
delight and lyrically
quaint, this is an LP that’s
sure to make you smile.

Goldie’s historic label is
still going strong after
23 years with some solid
recent releases from
Detboi and Digital. If
you’re into your dark
and moody DnB then
this won’t disappoint.
And if you’re new to
DnB, then be sure to

If you haven’t heard of
SIM yet, you oughta.
Hosted by Bailey and
Need for Mirrors, these
free nights usually take
place on a Wednesday
and are always a good
time, since they’re filled
with the right kinds of
DnB-heads, with hearts
filled with passion
for the music. While I
wouldn’t recommend
you take up a tobacco
regret was to be born 15
years too late. Rupture’s
Jungle nights are the
closest thing you can get
to that authentic 90’s rave
vibe in London, and with
the legendary Corsica
Studios soundsystem,
you’re in for a real treat.

Not gonna lie - I think
liquid nights can be quite
boring, but with a lineup

earplugs are a must).
Brookes Brothers is one
of the biggest names in
DnB right now; keep
your eyes peeled for this
one. Also: an LTJ Bukem
night at Village Under-
ground on the same day
if you like it old-skool.

Are you into Jungle? The
correct answer is yes,
and that your greatest
to resist. With almost
25 DJs, pretty much
every liquid artist you
might ever want to see
(or not) will be there. If
you still want more after
this, Liquicity is making
a rare appearance in
London the next day.

MUSIC Slight caveat: unfor-
tunately, it’s not in
London. But, if you can
cough up the money
for the Eurostar or
bus, then the Rampage
Weekend is only four
to five hours away and
will provide you with all
the Jump-Up goodness
you need for the year
(or the rest of your life).
Best soundsystems
The soundsystem at a
venue can make or break
a night out. Because
different venues attract
different subgenres and
movements, knowing
your particular niche
will entail knowing
about the right clubs
to find it in. If you’re
into your half-time,
Phonox has an excellent
system. Fabric’s Room
2 is revered by audio
junkies everywhere
(Room 1 is just loud).
Fire or Lightbox, both
in Vauxhall, are your
destinations for Jungle
(let’s rehash: a genre
you should be into).
Overall, however, the
award for best soundsys-
tem has to go to Phonox
or Corsica Studios.

November 24th
Fabric has arguably been
on a steep decline since
the last time (Eds: make
it future-proof) it closed
down, but the lineups
are still impressive. If
you’re partial to grime
and in-your-face neu-
rofunk, then you will
not regret attending
this legendary venue
(while you still can).
