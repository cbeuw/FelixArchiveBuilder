Royal Academy shows the links between two titans
Their latest exhibition explores the links between Salvador Dalí and Marcel Duchamp, two of the most influential
artists of the 20th
century
ARTS

S
alvador Dali and
Marcel Duchamp
are both regarded
as two of the
twentieth century’s most
influential artists, but
are often seen as polar
opposites. Although their
personal and professional
lives have been studied
extensively in literature,
this exhibition at the Royal
Academy is the first to
display their works side
by side, exploring their
friendship. Duchamp’s
work is highly conceptual;
today he is perhaps most
commonly remembered
for Fountain, a displaced
urinal he submitted to an
open exhibition under a
pseudonym, only to defend
it in a magazine under his
own well-regarded name
once it had been rejected.
Duchamp rejected the
idea that art was meant to
be aesthetically pleasing.
Although he personally
distanced himself from
any movements, he was
highly associated with the
Dadaism; an avant-garde,
intellectual movement
wherein artists produced
art rejecting bourgeois
values in the wake of the
First World War.
Dali, on the other
hand, is best known for
his highly technical,
renaissance-influenced
surrealist paintings, ex-
ploring the dream world
post-Freud, moving away
from rational thought. His
persona was based on a
‘love of everything that is
gilded and excessive’, and
he was highly criticised for
returning to Spain during
Franco’s reign, living out
his final years with his
wife in a castle.
Despite these differ-
ences in philosophy and
outlook, the playful artists
were united in their wit
and cynical view on life
and art. The exhibition
presents common themes
in the Artists’ work across
three rooms. The first,
Identity is both chron-
ological and thematic.
A highlight is Dali’s A
Portrait of my Father
(1925), painted just after
Dali had been kicked out
of the Academy in Madrid
for telling his examiners
they were unfit to judge
him. This is alongside
Duchamp’s Portrait of
the Artist’s Father (1910),
“The exhibition
is the first
to display
their works
side by side,
exploring their
friendship”
looking thoughtful and
fatigued. It is clear that
although Duchamp was
17 years older than Dali,
their interests and satirical
rebellion followed similar
trajectories, pushing the
boundaries of cubism and
futurism. Their shared
sense of humour can be
seen in their moustachioed
takes on the Mona Lisa.
Duchamp’s is titled with
a pun – L.H.O.O.Q (1919)
sounding out the French
sentence “She has a hot
arse.” while Dali’s Self
Portrait as the Mona Lisa
(1964) parodies his own
self-centredness.
The second room,
The Body and the Object
explores how both men
challenged conventional
media of art. Duchamp’s
ready-mades including
the fountain and bicycle
wheel sit on a backdrop
of Dali’s antipaintings; a
series of abstract shapes
on canvas which were an
expression of his frus-
tration over whether an
original form of painting
could ever be found. For
Fisherman in the Sun, Dali
refused to be restricted by
the confines of the canvas
and used rope to extend
it. Both artists abandoned
painting. Duchamp per-
manently in 1913, and
Dali temporarily in 1928.
Although this is before
the artists’ friendship,
it is possible that Dali
had been influenced by
Duchamp criticism of art
being appreciated only on
a ‘retinal’ level.
Perhaps another topic
of conversation in their
30-year friendship was
fascination with science
and questioning reality.
Dali’s Apparition of
Face and Fruit Dish on
a Beach (1938) is full of
visual puns. Once a few
are recognised, the reader
is tricked into looking for
more, finding shapes in
the clouds perhaps where
they were not originally
intended. These optical
illusions were an explo-
ration of his interest in
psychoanalysis and reality
itself. Duchamp’s ‘three
standard stoppages’ is my
favourite work in the exhi-
bition – three meter-long
ropes were dropped from
a height and their new
length end-to-end encased
in glass and declared a
‘standard’ unit of meas-
urement, almost laughing
at the arbitrary bases of
physics.
Another common
theme of the artists’ work
is eroticism and voyeur-
ism. Although Dali and
Duchamp are not the only
men in the world to have
appreciated nudes, their
artworks and lewd puns
extend beyond the chat of
dirty old men. Duchamp’s
final work, which he
worked on in secret over
the last two decades of
his life, Étant donnés
(1946-1966) is too fragile
to travel but is represented
with a photograph. The
work is perhaps one of
the first art installations,
and sits at the Philadelphia
Museum of Modern Art
behind a wooden door that
must be peeked through.
Inside lies a diorama of a
naked woman lying with
her legs splayed apart on
a bed of twigs and fallen
leaves. This sits alongside
Dali’s near pornographic
paintings, including The
First Days of Spring. Both
artists play with a reduc-
tive perspective of desire.
The focus of the final
section, Experimenting
with Reality and perhaps
the whole exhibition is a
replica of Duchamp’s large
glass, The Bride Stripped
Bare by her Bachelors,
Even. The objects sus-
pended in the panels
– including cones that
were left to gather dust to
depict ‘slow’ art – are par-
ticularly impressive. This
piece took over 10 years
to complete. A parallel is
drawn between the glass
and Dali’s Christ of Saint
John of the Cross (1951).
Both are the size of altar
pieces and have a definite
top and bottom half, but
this comparison seems the
crudest and weakest of the
whole exhibition, perhaps
an excuse to present one of
Duchamp’s most interest-
ing pieces, for which the
interpretations are endless.
One of the final works
in the exhibition is a
photograph of Dali and
Duchamp sat playing
chess, a shared hobby and
fascination which served
as inspiration for both. The
exhibition adds a personal
dimension to the under-
standing of both artists,
investigating a friendship
that spanned decades and
continents, allowing us
to better understand the
emotions of two revolu-
tionary painters.

TooYoungForWhat?:Ashowcaseof Basquiat’slegacy
and the creativity of London’s young artists
FHL: What makes
Basquiat’s art so im-
portant to you?
CW: What’s important
to me is the response it
evokes in the people I
work with. Whether it
is families visiting the
gallery with children
who have never heard of
Basquiat, or the Young
Barbican members who
have been waiting most
of their lives to see his
work in real life – it has
struck me how inviting
and accessible his work
is to everyone who comes
to see it. Laden with
symbols, text and imagery,
Basquiat’s work draws
out people’s curiosity and
invites the audience to
make their own interpre-
tations.
FHL: How do you
think Basquiat has in-
fluenced art today?
CW: Basquiat’s work
continues to inspire new
artists across all the art
forms; young people are
inspired by the fact that he
had no formal training and
broke the boundaries of
the art world – I think his
cross-arts approach and
the collaborative nature of
the New York scene also
resonates with the next
generation of artists who
are increasingly under
pressure to do more and
be multi-disciplinary.
FHL: Why did you de-
cide to curate this
event and why now?
CW: We heard a lot of
excitement from the
young people we work
with at Barbican Guildhall
Creative Learning when
Boom for Real was first
announced - the work of
Jean-Michel Basquiat
really resonates with
young people. It felt fitting
to curate an event that
gives young people the
opportunity to explore and
showcase their creativity.
Poets, curators, reviewers,
artists and photographers:
Basquiat’s cross-arts
practice provides a perfect
platform to bring these
art forms together at
Barbican.
FHL: How and why
did you choose the
established artists in-
volved?
CW: The artists involved
are a mix of artists we
have existing relationships
with, like poet Jacob
Sam-La Rose who leads
Barbican Young Poet and
Paula Varjack, a performer
who is a tutor on Barbican
Junior Poets, and artists we
have cultivated projects
with specifically for this
show, like glitch artist
Antonio Roberts who we
are undertaking a new
glitch portrait project with.
We have also engaged
four past-members of
Barbican Young Poets to
host conversations on the
‘SAMO©, but different’
stage, and have a group of
sixteen young artists from
across all our programmes
who will be creating new
work in a two-day ‘Art
Hack’ and showcasing
it on our main stage. To
engage new artists we
have partnered with Poet
in the City to co-curate
several parts of the event
– through our work with
them we’ve been able to
find an exciting group of
writers, poets, musicians
and street artists, all of
whom feel a personal
connection to Basquiat’s
work.
FHL: What first drew
you to these artists?
CW: We approached them
mainly because their
practice had a link or con-
nection to Basquiat. For
some artists this was a very
literal connection – for
example Gemma Weekes
will be sharing an excerpt
of her performance Who
Murked Basquiat?, a piece
inspired by the work, life
and times of Basquiat and
her own struggles with
misogynoir. For others it
was more about finding
parallels in practice. I
approached glitch artist
Antonio Roberts because
of his interest in copyright,
ownership and appropria-
tion of content – Antonio
is both an artist and the
curator of the show ‘No
Copyright Infringement
Intended’ and the themes
that run through his
practice resonate with
Basquiat’s process.
FHL: Is the future of
art in collaboration?
CW: Collaboration is
always going to be impor-
tant to art, but it is espe-
cially essential for young
creatives today who are
under pressure to be artist,
curator, agent, marketer
and often commissioner of
their own work. It is im-
portant that young people
are supported and feel
they are a part of a creative
community that both
supports them and pushes
their boundaries. With Too
Young For What?, we are
trying to draw inspiration
from the collaborative
scene that Basquiat was
a part of, while drawing
parallels to the London
scene today. Many of the
workshops and activities
are collaborative in nature
and the ‘Make A Scene’
room invites visitors to
have a say, discuss and
create content that reflects
their creativity today.
Why is it important
to have platforms for
young artists?
CW: With increasing
pressure and standardisa-
tion in formal education,
it’s important that young
people have opportunities
to explore their own
creativity and measure
their progress against
their own goals and stand-
ards. Barbican’s Young
Creative programmes
give young people an
opportunity discover their
creative voice and work
with mentors who support
them to showcase their
best work. There are many
routes into careers in the
arts and it’s important to
provide young people with
informal opportunities that
fit around the pressures
in their lives – our pro-
grammes like the Young
Visual Arts Group give
young people insight into
what a career as an artist/
curator looks like, but also
into the inner workings of
arts organisations, so they
gain an understanding
of how to programme,
market, deliver and
evaluate their own arts
event.
Too Young for What will
take place at the Barbican
Centre on Saturday the 7th
of October from 12 noon.
Admission is free. Check
barbican.org.uk for full-
programme of events
Too Young For What? is a free day of art and activities at the Barbican Centre inspired by Basquiat: Boom For
Real, a retrospective on the work of American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. The day will feature work by glitch
artist Antonio Roberts, poet Jacob Sam-La Rose and performance maker Paula Varjack as well as workshops and
discussions. Freya Hepworth-Lloyd spoke to curator Chris Webb about Basquiat’s legacy and the importance of
supporting young artists.
