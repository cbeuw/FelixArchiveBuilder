Fancy trying something new? Helping others? Developing your
skills? Or just having fun? Come along to Imperial College Union’s
Volunteering Fair!
Here are some of the top three reasons you should volunteer:
1. Good for your health and wellbeing – whether it’s out in the
fresh air or having a break from revision, volunteering will help your
mental health and wellbeing!
2. Development – volunteering is the perfect chance to learn new
skills and develop your existing ones (great for future employment)!
3. Chance to help others – you will get that feel good feeling of
knowing that you have helped other people and hopefully changed
some lives!
There are many other reasons why you should volunteer so come
and find out more and meet over 40 different organisations and
charities you could get involved with!
There fair is taking place in the Great hall between 11:00 – 14:00, we
hope to see you there!
