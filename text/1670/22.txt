IC MusicTech
Imperial College
Speakers Toastmasters
Club helps undergraduates
and postgraduates improve
their public speaking and
communication skills in a
friendly, supportive envi-
ronment.
At every meeting,
members give prepared
speeches, practice im-
promptu speaking, offer
constructive feedback to
each other, and socialise
with a diverse group
from across the Imperial
College community.
Every meeting provides
valuable opportunities
for students to refine the
public speaking skills
essential to lab meetings,
class presentations, and
viva voce exams, as well as
in professional situations
such as job interviews.
Our club helps connect
students from different
educational backgrounds,
fostering the exchange of
ideas while broadening
our members’ intellectual
horizons. We offer men-
toring, in which experi-
enced members guide new
members through their
first speech projects and
help them get comfortable
with the meeting roles.
International students
have greatly benefited
from practicing both
conversational and formal
English at our meetings. In
addition to public speaking
training, our meetings
also help students refine
their interpersonal skills
through interactions with
people of different cultural

IC CROSS COUNTRY

We’re the club that
does all things running,
throwing, and jumping for
all abilities!
We offer varied training
sessions every day of
the week: a typical week
contains a circuits session
popular for building
fitness, a track session
for power, a lunch run
around the Royal Parks,
an interval session for
speed, a core workout
for strength, Saturday
morning park runs, and
legendary Sunday break-
fast runs along the River
Thames. Despite having
nearly 200 members last
year, we are one of the
most friendly clubs, with
regular socials and races.
Autumn term highlights
include a trip to the
Brighton 10k, cross-coun-
try races against other
London universities, and
indoor athletics champi-
onships.
We also adventure
outside of London with
trips last year to Newcas-
tle, Sheffield, and Oxford
as well as the Netherlands
and the Pyrenees.
Whether you’re a
running expert or have
never made it past
walking, come along to
one of our sessions –
you’ll soon be hooked on
the infectious squad banter
whilst staying fit at the
same time!
