A call to arms! Why we need to
change our mental health provision
Imperial students are being let down by the support they get whilst at
university. It’s time for that to change.

I
t’s a well-known fact
that the majority of
students at Imperial
will experience some
mental health difficulties
during their studies.
Typically, the first place
they are sent is to the
Imperial Counselling
Service. However, to
send students there by
default operates under
the assumption that the
service is fit for purpose;
in its current state, it most
certainly isn’t.
According to last year’s
Mentality survey, 40%
of students waited over 3
weeks to be seen, with just
under a fifth of students
waiting over six weeks. If
a student is struggling, by
the time the counselling
service offers them help,
the moment has often
passed. Moreover, each
student is only offered a
handful of appointments
per year, with a maximum
of seven being offered
to students most at risk.
These time constraints
mean that students often
felt like they only received
generic advice, could
only tackle superficial
issues they were facing,
and some reported feeling
under pressure to use the
sessions as efficiently as
possible which only ended
up generating additional
anxiety. One student even
reported feeling like they
were burdening the service
just by using it. Evidently,
the service that’s supposed
to be making students feel
better isn’t doing its job.
The service’s biggest
failing is clearly its waiting
times. An important part
of mental health services
is checking if there is
any immediate risk to the
patient, which cannot be
done weeks after they’ve
asked to be seen. It’s not
asking too much to have
a counselling service that
offers initial appointment
within a few days of
enquiry, especially when
other college services
offer similar; Ethos has
an online booking system
for activities and classes
where you can even get
same day slots. The fact
that you can take an Ethos
induction on the same day
as you booked it and yet
have to wait six weeks for
a counselling appointment
is staggering, and just
goes to demonstrate how
off college priorities are.
Now, that’s not to
say that the counselling
service is at fault. In fact,
they’re doing the best they
can with what they’ve
got – which is exactly the
problem. More impor-
tantly, the issue with the
service is twofold: not only
is the counselling service
underfunded, but it also
doesn’t have any room
to expand. The service
is in some hidden-away
corridor in the Sherfield
Building, with no more
rooms to house coun-
sellors even if the funds
were available. There
isn’t even a waiting room:
you just have to stand in
the corridor, awkwardly
waiting for the counsellor
to call you in. Frankly,
Cube Faculty Building
and significant sections of
the Sherfield Building; the
majority of the staff there
don’t need to be located
on campus, let alone in
such central locations.
There’s plenty of room
for the counselling service
to expand, it’s just the
college do not consider
it important enough to
inconvenience themselves
with the moving process.
The current status quo
is not acceptable. With
the creation of the White
City campus, discussions
are happening right now
to decide what’s moving
to the new campus and
what’s staying in South
Kensington. This gives
us the perfect opportunity
to fight for counselling
service expansion, but this
will only succeed with
student action behind it.
To find out more about the
campaign, come to ICU’s
World Mental Health Day
event on the 10th October,
or email at icu-mental-
health@ic.ac.uk. Help
make this the year where
things finally change!
Here’s what I’m up
to at the moment!
S
tepping into the newly-created role
of Mental Health Liberation Officer, I
was acutely aware of the scale of the
challenges faced. In the Mentality
Survey, which was run two years ago, 70% of
student at Imperial reported mental stresses
or a mental health problem. It’s so important
that we hit the ground running this year.
We’ve organised our first major event of
the year: on Tuesday 10th October, World
Mental Health Day (WMHD), we’re going to
be raising awareness of mental health, as
well as raising money for the Young Minds
charity. I’ve organised a partnership between
Imperial College Union and Young Minds,
which does fantastic work in promoting
self-care, addressing mental health stigma,
and encouraging young people to lobby the
government on mental health issues. If you’re
interested, come along to Beit Quad next
Tuesday, where we’ll be running a number of
different events – you can find out more info
about Young Minds, and see how student
societies can make a difference at Imperial.
I’ve also been speaking to incoming
undergraduate and masters students across
Imperial, about how the Union represents
them regarding mental health issues. It’s vital
that all students at our university know about
how they can make their voices heard, and
where they can turn to for help.
However, there is no point in raising
awareness if there is no commitment from
the College and faculty to increase the
provisions available to students. One of the
major issues is that there simply isn’t space
for the counselling service to expand – we’re
launching our campaign to pressure the
College to change this on WMHD, so please
come along and ask me any questions you
might have about what we plan on doing.
During the rest of the year I will be putting
pressure on the College – it’s time that your
voices are heard, and real change is achieved.

“The current
status quo of
mental health
provision at
Imperial is not
acceptable”
the current location is just
embarrassing.
This is a complete slap
in the face when you
consider how much room
on campus is dedicated
to college staff that have
no contact with students
whatsoever. Some obvious
examples are the Blue
