Maintenance grants could make a return as Tories fight
to win back the youth vote
NEWS
The Union announced
the change earlier
this week, which has
prompted ire from
some students.

U
nion bars have
poured their
last pints of
Stella Artois
4%, as they switched
their house lager over to
Bud Light on Monday.
The move was an-
nounced to students by
Matt Blackett, Deputy
President (Finance &
Services), in a Facebook
post on the morning of
Monday 2nd October.
The change comes after 5
years of Stella 4 being the
house larger across Beit
bars – 568, Union Bar,
and Metric – h-bar, and
Reynolds.
The prices will remain
the same as 2016/17, at
£2.70 for a pint of Bud
Light. This is in line with
Blackett’s manifesto
promise of “no above-in-
flation drink prices”. The
also mentioned in The
Guardian three days pre-
viously). An anonymous
senior source told the i:
“We don’t think it is right
that the poorest students
come out of university
with most debt.”
Maintenance grants
were scrapped in 2015
in favour of loans, which
were more generous but
also had to be paid back
with interest. Then-chan-
cellor George Osborne
made the changes on the
basis that maintenance
grants cost the taxpayer
£1.57 billion a year. He
claimed that lifting the cap
on student places would
double this figure to £3
billion and there would
be a “basic unfairness in
asking taxpayers to fund
grants for people who are
likely to earn a lot more
than them”.
The IFS estimates that
switching from loans to
grants would cost just
under £500 million.
The changes to tuition
fees would also require
an additional £2 billion
government funding. The
government has declined
to say where this extra
money will come from.
Any details will emerge
in Philip Hammond’s
autumn budget statement
next month. Let’s hope the
magic money tree is still
alive and well.

Union claims the price
freeze will save students
more than £10,000, since
remaining with Stella
would have required an
increase in price by 10p.
In a statement, Blackett
said “the opportunity
arose for us to reduce the
cost of our house larger
whilst also increasing the
investment in other areas
of the bars to improve
student experience, whilst
not losing any quality in
the products we offer”.
He said that this increased
investment should “give
you a better service and an
improved experience at all
of our venues”
While Stella 4 has,
as the name suggests, a
strength of 4% ABV, Bud
Light only has a strength
of 3.5%. On BeerAdvo-
cate, which describes itself
as “your go-to resource
for beer, powered by an
independent community
of enthusiasts and profes-
sionals”, Stella 4 achieves
a rating of 2.97 out of 5,
while Bud Light is on
1.86.
One of the bar staff
Felix spoke to said that
they had overheard a cus-
tomer react to the change
by saying it was “a cold
day in hell”. Students who
spoke to Felix expressed
similar sentiments: one
described Bud Light as
“literal piss”; another
said that the “hypocrisy”
of the Union’s failure to
consult students on the
change, while criticising
the College for making
changes to Campus Ser-
vices without consultation,
was “chilling”.
It wasn’t all bad news
though: one student
claimed that Bud Light
made a much better mixer
for his snakebite.
Blackett told Felix:
“We constantly change the
offering in our bars with
no student consultation, as
it is not always appropriate
and timely for feedback
from students to be gar-
nered.” He explained that
the decision on the change
needed to be made within
two days of the offer being
recieved, and his being
elected on a manifesto
promises to you” section,
Imperial College Union,
which is a not-for-profit
charity, states that “the
range of products we offer
will be regularly reviewed
to ensure we are providing
you with the products you
want”. They also promise
that “prices will be com-
petitive”, and they will
“regularly let you have
a say in the products we
sell”.

Onwards and upwards...
S
o, we’re getting
a bit better this
week: the edi-
torial is being
written at 8pm, rather
than just before the
deadline. If this keeps
up, we’ll have comput-
ers machine writing the
whole issue, and I’ll
be jetting off to travel
around Italy before
Xmas. But for now it’s
progress enough.
This week sees
Felix kicking back into
action. We’re back, with
everyone’s favourites:
puzzles! Endless pages
of Arts! Union hackery!
It’s like we never really
left.
When chatting with
the News team about
what should go on the
front page this week, we
were trying to decide
between two stories: on
the one hand, a shadowy
powerful body has
made what seems to be
a decision against the
wishes of their elector-
ate; on the other hand,
Theresa May announced
they were going to cap
tuition fees.
In the end the tuition
fees debate won out,
but while I suspect it
will have more of an
impact on the financial
futures of so many of
us, at the end of the day
all that most of us really
care about is being fed,
clothed, watered, and as
happy as can be possible
whilst working in the
Physics department.
For that reason, I think
the story that will have
more of an impact this
week is the fact that
the Union have poured
their last Stella, and are
swapping their house
lager to Bud Light.
While I’m more
partial to stout myself,
I can see why people
are upset – not so much
about the change, but
about the fact that
they weren’t consulted
about it beforehand.
Matt Blackett, Deputy
President (Finances and
Services), explained
some of his reasoning
to Felix, and only time
will tell how things will
go. But this is what we
should be doing at Felix:
fostering debate and
dialogue; encouraging
students to share their
views; and ensuring that
those in power – both the
Union and the College –
are held to account.
Dialogue was some-
thing I was thinking
a bit about after the
Freshers’Fair this week.
While Felix was out-
flanked and out-teched
by ICTV, we still had a
lot of interested students
coming up to us. Some
wanted to write. Others
just wanted to know
what we were. Others
still thought we were a
cat appreciation society
– an easy mistake to
make.
Even if you missed
us this week, I want to
use this editorial to try
and convince you to get
involved. Not only do
you get to work with a
great bunch of people,
but you also get free
tea and coffee in the
Felix Office. With that
in mind, we’re holding
a pizza party in the West
Basement next Monday
at 6pm – come along,
enjoy some drinks and
food, and meet the
people who stay up
stupid hours to get the
paper out on time.
Some of you might
end up writing for us.
Many more will just
read Felix, just like
you’re doing now. Bless
you – that’s enough for
me.
