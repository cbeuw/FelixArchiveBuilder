When in Rum
W
adi Rum,
AKA the
Valley of
the Moon,
is Jordan’s largest valley.
Not that the size matters
much in itself. It’s also
Hollywood’s go-to
location for all movies
Martian, which tells you
all you need to know about
the kind of landscapes
on offer. I was initially
dubious about spending
several days of a short trip
surrounded by endless red-
ness but, in the end, Wadi
Rum proved to be nothing
short of spectacular.
It’s the perfect place to
unwind with a good book
or meditate in silence
among the stillness. Or,
for the more energetically
charged, it also offers
endless sandstone and
granite mountains to scale.
And that’s before the sun
sets and the stars rise.
If you were interning in
London over the summer,
you’ve probably forgotten
what stars look like. Well,
I’ll remind you: they’re
magical twinkles of hope,
a testament to the beauty of
the cosmos, and a symbol
of both your irrelevance
and insignificance, some-
thing you probably need
reminding of if you’ve
been stuck on a trading
floor all summer.
The Nabateans, of Petra
fame, left their mark in
the form of graffiti, rock
paintings, and temples.
Nowadays, Wadi Rum is
home to several communi-
ties of Bedouin, nomadic
people living across the
deserts of NorthAfrica and
the Middle East. While
some Bedouins have aban-
doned their nomadic tradi-
tions in favour of a more
modern lifestyle, many
groups have retained their
traditional practices of tent
knitting, arts and crafts,
and clan structures. Many
such groups are very much
open to outsiders, who
often act as a main source
of income.
One of the issues faced
by Bedouin communities
is the complete erosion
of traditions in favour
of western comforts, a
process facilitated by
certain types of tourism.
New fancy desert camps
are emerging all the time,
tending towards ugly,
self-contained ‘pods’ in
place of traditional tents.
Such camps threaten to
displace local people and
ruin the pristine land-
scapes. Meanwhile, ex-
cessive around-the-clock
air conditioning within
the pods contributes to the
climate change.
Thankfully,somecamps
are refusing to abandon
traditions by offering an
authentic Bedouin expe-
rience instead of luxury,
one that respects local
indigenous history and
culture. That’s not to say
that there’s a sacrifice in
comfort or quality: the
more traditional camps
are perfectly pleasant and
suitable for both back-
packers and families alike.
One standout camp is
Rahayeb Desert Camp,
whose simple quarters,
found in a peaceful
location within the protect-
ed area, offer a true escape
from the chaos of the
newer camps. The staff are
friendly and knowledgea-
ble, and provide support in
organising camels, jeeps,
chicken and lamb, slow-
cooked beneath the sand.
This is by far the best base
from which to explore the
surrounding area.
Finally, no trip to Wadi
Rum would be complete
without escaping the
Martian rock immersion
to appreciate its true mag-
nitude from 4,000 feet.
In fact, the Royal Aero
Sports Club of Jordan was
founded by King Abdullah
after discovering the thrill
of flying and seeing the
beauty of the country from
above. This non-profit
organisation now offers
activities, such as hot air
balloon rides, from which
you can really appreciate
the magnificence of the
area. The panoramic views
are out of this world and
not to be missed.
