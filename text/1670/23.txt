D
odgeball is
a fast paced,
new and exciting
sport. The concept is very simple,
there are two teams competing and the aim
of the game is to get everyone out by either
hitting them with the ball or catching their
throws.
Imperial Dodgeball is a fun and social
club for people of all abilities, ranging
from those who have never played before
to full international players. As a club we
are growing each year both off and on the
dodgeball court. Last year our first team,
while enjoying socials ranging from Brick
Lane curry to trampoline dodgeball, won a
national University League. Over 7 rounds,
competing against 7 other university teams,
our first team took the title creating fantastic
montage clips along the way whether it be
diving or double catches.The success wasn’t
limited however just to them, as our second
team also won the plate in the London
Tournament with a highlight reel of face
shots and falling off the court.
We want to continue this success, and we
are aiming to enter, and win, both the men’s
and women’s leagues this year. If you want
to help us win or just blow off some steam

5-6pm. For any of you lucky Woodwardians
we have a session in iGym Saturday 10am-
12pm. Or just come and find our team at
sports night.
To quote a great man,“Imperial Dodgeball
is a fun and social club for people of all
abilities”.

n Wednesday
23rd August
I m p e r i a l
College’s Cross
Country and Athletics
team began to make their
journey to their interna-
tional summer tour. Their
destination was Font-
Romeu – 1800m above
sea-level in the Pyrenees
and a 2.5 hour 1€ bus
journey from the airport in
Perpignan. Upon arrival,
it was discovered that
they were to be sharing
an apartment complex
with athletes of a similar
calibre to their own – the
Korean triathlon team.
The stunning views and
impressive peaks visible
from the balconies whet
their appetite for a week
of gruelling hills, tricky
trails, and challenging
climbs.
The week of training
saw a number of events:
steady group runs to take
in the local sights, such
as Europe’s largest solar
furnace; a questionable
“rest” day featuring a re-
covery-turned-tempo run;
a super early run to watch
the sunrise from a vantage
point by the ruins of a
castle; a competitive con-
tinuous relay session at the
athletics track; attempts at
ranking highly on some
of the nearby Strava
didn’t consist solely of
running!
During the week, the
four rooms took turns to
host a Come Dine with
Me-style evening of food,
drink, and entertainment.
The themes included
wedding, Ancient Greek,
British pub, and tradition-
al French, with food high-
lights including an assort-
ment of canapés, stuffed
peppers, three-in-one
pasta, homemade curry,
tartiflette, sticky toffee
pudding, apple crumble,
and Greek doughnuts.
The evening entertain-
ments featured various
games that revealed lots
about the club members,
particularly the pub quiz
which featured a round
involving embarrassing
past Facebook statuses
from tour members and a
size comparison between
Big Ben, a Mini Cooper,
a King-sized bed, the Taj
Mahal, and the penis of a
blue whale.
Besides all this, the
CX about to drop the hottest running mixtape of 2k17 // IC Cross Country and Athletics
week saw countless games
of Perudu, questionable
uses for bags of flour, and
large portions of banter
– sometimes reaching
dangerously high levels!
On the last night, to cele-
brate the end of the highly
successful week, the team
headed for a late-night
rave by one of the larger
statues in the outdoor
statue walk.
The club would like
to thank outgoing club
captain Will Jones for
fantastic work in organ-
ising the trip and wish all
members of the club grad-
uating/leaving all the best
for the future. Our fingers
are crossed for another
successful year under the
helm of Alex Mundell,
and the club looks forward
to welcoming many new
members over the next
few weeks!

A quest for adventure! Triathletes take on Wales
O
n the 2nd
S e p t e m b e r
2017, 15 super
keen triath-
letes took to the hills of
the picturesque Brecon
Beacons to compete in the
second to last event in the
Questars Adventure Race
series!
These adrenaline-filled
adventure races involve 90
minutes of trail running,
2.5 hours of mountain
biking and one hour of
kayaking on local canals
– not something for the
faint hearted. There’s also
an orienteering twist to the
races, as teams compete
to reach pre-positioned
checkpoints and gain
points. The tougher the
checkpoint is to reach, the
more points are assigned
to it. At the end, the team
with the highest number
of points is crowned the
champion.
We split-up into in-
dividual teams of three
or four to take on our
fellow tri members and
50 other equally fit &
motivated teams. Olympic
rower, Helen Glover,
even decided to make an
appearance! This race
certainly wasn’t going to
be a walk in the park.
Being a team race, one
constraint was that team
members could not be
more than 10m apart –
meaning the entirety of
the threesome/foursome
had to complete grueling
uphill climbs or long
kayaking distances to be
allowed the checkpoint
points.
When the klaxon
sounded at 9am, it was
each team for themselves.
Everyone headed off in
different directions, each
believing theirs would lead
them to glory. The teams
only ever encountered
each other on the kayaking
section, where slaloming
tactics (potentially due
to poor technique) were
employed by some to try
and hinder other teams
progress.
Sweat, tears, and a
few blisters later, all the
IC teams conquered the
hills and (just about) did
not get lost. We then had
an agonizing wait before
the race results were
processed and the winner
announced! Luckily, tri IC
isn’t competitive at all and
everyone’s all for the ‘it’s
the taking part that counts’
moto...
As it’s commonly
known, there is only one
winner and unfortunately,
this wasn’t an Imperial
team. However, the
top-ranking IC team came
a respectable 23rd overall
and more importantly
they were the winner
of bragging rights over
everyone else!
Thanks Questars
Brecon Beacons – Tri IC
will definitely be back for
more next year.

Imperial Rugby kick off this year with trials and pints
I
mperial rugby pre-
season kicked off
on Monday 18th
September, resulting
in a rag-tag crew of motley
looking seniors and fresh-
faced freshers gathering
at Ethos. Among the new
faces were reliable fellas
such as Amin, Michael,
and Jacob, as well as a
Lord Farquaad imper-
sonator and a nervous
young fresher called Will
Aynsley (poor lad, he was
practically shaking).
Summer was officially
over, and it was time
to begin excavating
the long-buried rigs of
ICURFC in preparation
for Freshers’Week and the
promise of far-off ACC
nights parading around
the union as Spartans.
Once gathered, the squad
was informed that the
first session would be a
rigorous fitness test to
see just how great our fall
from grace had been over
summer. Upon hearing
these news, Lord Alling-
ham of his father’s estate
promptly paid off the Sport
Imperial staff to feign a
knee injury, and spent the
rest of the training session
loudly commentating as
everyone else was put
through their paces.
With fitness testing
over, the next few
days got underway as
expected, the team gelling
together over rugby and
weights sessions. The
new coaching setup, now
joined by Martin’s broth-
er-in-bicep Coach Lovejoy
and led by flair-master
Coach Will, was firing on
all cylinders and we were
beginning to look like a
real squad again: Chopper
was chopping (people and
pints), Owen was sniping,
Allingham was coaching,
Toby was watching
other people train, and
Blackett was breaking all
the promises he’d made
in the run-up to his Sabb
election; it was Imperial
rugby as it should be.
The first of our two
preseason matches,
against King’s, saw a tight
fixture in which the new
game system was used
to great effect in the first
quarter but ultimately
dropped off as our fitness
levels faltered. After a less
successful second half we
ended up with a 20-5 loss.
However, not to be put
out by this, the next night’s
annual Oxford social saw
a full turnout and a great
night on the town. One or
two of the lucky Oxford
gals even managed to bag
themselves a long, steamy
night of cuddling. Saucy.
Apart from that, preseason
finished successfully, a
friendly against Brunel
University took place,
and more freshers than we
could anticipate showed
their faces. Unfortunately,
Sylvia has yet to make an
appearance (perhaps she
heard about Brady’s antics
and decided to steer clear),
but apart from that we are
ready to hit the ground
running in the new season
and look forward to seeing
all of our new members
soon!
