ACC Football tour report (2nd draft)

I
t was suggested by
certain Felix editors
that Football come
up with an engaging
piece on its recent summer
tour to Budapest because
everyone cares about what
we did for our summer va-
cation. I diligently wrote a
piece, though seemingly
my first draft wasn’t good
enough for this highly
coveted newspaper and
for that I am tremendous-
ly sorry. Since I’ve got
nothing better to do with
my time than my pesky
doctorate I decided to take
to heart the editors com-
ments and do my utmost
to make it interesting and
less personal. Without our
outstanding content, how
else will Imperial student
be able to know what ACC
football did on a summer
holiday tour?
Because reality is
slightly boring, I’ve had
to embellish parts of our
trip for reader satisfaction
and view counts. It was
decided that the setting
of Hungary was a bit too
mundane so I’ve changed
it to a beautiful beach in
the Panamanian archipel-
ago of Bocas Del Toro,
bordering Costa Rica to
engage readers more.
Furthermore, because
football is not to every-
one’s liking I’ve chosen to
remove all mentions of the
sport. For now we’ll call
them “non-descriptive”
activities to best allow
for reader immersion into
the story. Another major
selling point for any story
is a feel good ending. So
instead of the protagonists
having any sort of fun and
relaxing, I’ve replaced the
character’s motivations
with nobler causes such
as helping the elderly,
eliminating malaria in the
due to foreign corpora-
tions buying them out.
Now that we’ve outlined
all major changes made to
our dire trip to Hungary,
we may begin our fantas-
tical journey.
The football team went
to Hungary for a sporting
tour and all members
involved had a lot of fun
together. Sometimes we

ICUAFC make a heroic comeback after Sports Editor criticises their previous effort at a tour report
that’s what we did for our
summer and I owe it all to
those editors for inspiring
me to write this all out so
that now I can put “Felix
Contributor” on my CV
and all it took was 400
words.
Note from the Sports
Editor: Yes, apologies for
being honest about the
first draft... Look on the
bright side: you can tell
freshers you are a pub-
lished contributor now.
For anyone looking to
contribute to the sports
section (tours, match
reports etc.) shoot an email
to fsport@ic.ac.uk. Keep
it entertaining though. A
story-form-itinerary isn’t.
