Autumn Elections open, introducing the newWellbeing
Representative Network

The Network, which
was introduced this
year, marks a radical
shift in the Union’s
structure of student
volunteers

for Imperial
College Un-
ion’s Autumn
Elections opened last
week. Over 400 roles are
open to students, includ-
ing positions on the new
Wellbeing Representa-
tion Network (WBRN).
The nominations, which
opened on 30th September
will remain open until the
end of next week, closing
on 12th October. Other
positions include roles on
the Academic Representa-
tion Network (ARN)
– a body of students
responsible for feeding
back educational issues
to their department – Or-
dinary Council Members,
Constituent Union roles,
and the Gender Equality
Liberation Officer.
This is the first year that
the WBRN is being run.
The scheme is “unique
among British universi-
ties”, and modelled on
the existing ARN. The
Union’s definition of
‘wellbeing’ covers five
key areas where support
is available to students:
‘Health’, ‘Financial Con-
cerns’, ‘Relationships’,
‘Equality and Diversity’,
and ‘Personal Safety’.
The WBRN consists
of 85 student volunteers,
from across all depart-
ments: there will be one
‘Departmental Wellbeing
Representative’ for each
UG department, and one
‘Year Wellbeing Repre-
sentative’ for each year of
a course. Each represent-
ative within the Network
will have to complete
a mandatory induction
delivered by the Union.
Some representatives will
also receive Mental Health
First Aid training, which
will not be mandatory;
additional training will be
made available throughout
the year, focusing on
various aspects of wellbe-
ing.
The framework has
been arranged under a
CASPER framework:
reps are responsible for
“Campaigning, Awareness
raising, Signposting, Pro-
moting positive conversa-
tions, Early intervention,
and Representation”. Rep-
resentatives will collect
students’ views on well-
being-related issues and
refer students to available
areas of support, although
they “will never act as a
support network”.
any such Welfare Officers
would be incorporated
into the WBRN, should
they so wish.
O’Connor, said the
WBRN was created as
part of the Union’s strate-
gic aims for 2017-20: “To
improve our capacity to
support students through
the academic, emotional
and social challenges of
studying in the high-per-
forming, pressurised and
fast-paced environment of
Imperial.”
O’Connor added
that the Network would
“facilitate better commu-
nication between staff and
students”, as well as “give
us a deeper understanding
of the issues students
face.” He told Felix that
his ambition is that the
Network, which he will
head, “will provide us
with the evidence base to
support a broader wellbe-
ing strategy.”
Damian Coveney, the
CGCU Welfare Officer,
welcomed the introduction
of the WBRN, saying that
“introducing more volun-
teers dedicated to all facets
of wellbeing...can only be
a positive change around
campus. Since Wellbeing
Reps will be obliged to
report issues they have
been presented with by
their peers, it has the
potential to find out what
truly affects students.”
He went on to say that
CGCU would be using the
WBRN to gather data on
wellbeing in their Faculty
to determine differences
between year groups.
However, some student
representatives have con-
cerns about the WBRN:
Michael Edwards, RCSU
President, said that
while the network has “a
significant potential to
make a lot of change”, the
Union needs to “realise
that one of the costs will
be the well-being of the
students that take up
these roles in the trial
years.” Abhijay Sood,
RCSU Academic Affairs
Officer, raised issues with
how the WBRN had been
developed: “If the Union
really gave a damn about
democracy, they’d have
consulted properly with
students; there wasn’t so
much as a vote at Council
on this...if the Union ever
does anything this big
again, we need to make
sure they tell us ahead of
are already doing: “I am
concerned that the Union
has too much work to do
already, and this will only
worsen things”, said one
student representative.
Another student told
Felix: “The Union has
a lot of problems – not
having enough roles isn’t
one of them.”
O’Connor told Felix:
“We have spoken at length
to a small number of stu-
dents who had legitimate
concerns about the safety
of Wellbeing Reps, and
we are grateful for their
views, which have helped
improve it. Their concerns
were often ones that we
had already identified our-
selves, and we have put
the safety of our members
at the heart of our planning
for this Network.”
Nominations close next
Thursday. Voting will be
open for five days, from
16-20th October. Interest-
ed applicants can register

“The Wellbeing

Representatives will
also regularly meet to
discuss issues raised
by students. They will
be invited to sit on the
Union’s Community and
Welfare Board, and De-
partmental Reps will meet
with faculty members in
termly Student Staff Com-
mittees.
There will be crossover
between current Welfare
Officers of some depart-
mental societies – such as
Bioengineering Society’s
Welfare Officer, who was
elected in March – and
the new Network. Deputy
President (Welfare) Fintan
O’Connor told Felix that

mperial president
Professor Alice Gast
has been chosen
as a non-executive
member of UK Research
and Innovation (UKRI).
She is one of twelve
board appointments
recently announced
by science minister Jo
Johnson.
UKRI, which will
formally come into being
in April 2018, seeks to
develop the strength of
its constituent research
councils, Innovate UK,
and new council Research
England. It will advise
on budget allocation
(including the Industrial
Strategy Challenge Fund)
to maximise the benefits of
social impact. Documents
published by UKRI also
claim the UK produces
a “disproportionate per-
centage of the world’s
top research” which must
be better translated into
commercial outcomes.
This focus on the
economy is made clear
by the high proportion of
business leaders on the
board.
UKRI has said it will
push for quality and
competition and stick to
the Haldane principle (i.e.
researchers will decide
where funds are directed,
not politicians).
Professor Gast said:
“UKRI aims to be the best
research and innovation
organisation in the world
and will play a critical role
in making sure we have
an environment where re-
search and innovation will
flourish. I look forward
to working with the
science minister and my
colleagues on the board to
support our world-leading
institutions as we push the
boundaries of discovery
for the benefit of all in our
society.”
Johnson said: “UKRI
has a pivotal role in our
future as a knowledge
