ear Freshers,
Seeing as
you’ve all
descended upon
campus to begin your
arduous journey towards
getting a pretty piece of
paper from some people
with letters in front their
names, I thought I’d tell
you a couple things I’ve
learnt in my own time here.
These are four things that
I’ve learned about univer-
sity that I think will help
every fresher get through
first year – because a little
heads up doesn’t hurt.
Make an effort to
meet people
This is probably one of
the most important things
to do in the first term of
university – a good be-
ginning here can set you
up for success throughout
your degree and beyond.
During the first term,
people are still forming
friendship groups and are
open to new people. It’s
a socially-fluid situation,
and requires work to make
connections with perma-
nence. Identify people you
think are cool, and turn
them from ‘people you’ve
seen once’ into ‘people
you know’ by making the
effort to meet them two
or three more times. Once
that initial connection is
made it’ll likely last for a
while, and then you can
suss them out to see if
you actually get on with
them beyond the universal
‘ooh-we’re-both-freshers-
isn’t-this-cool-but-also-a-
little-scary’.
As time goes on, people
will have started to form
loose groups, and by the
time the end of first year
rolls around they are a little
bit more established. It can
be a little bit more difficult
to ‘break in’ to an entirely
new friendship group, es-
pecially since people have
less time for socialising
in exam season. I’m not
saying go to every mingle,
pub crawl, and club night
at Metric – nobody’s got
the time (or liver capacity)
for that. All I’m saying is
to make that initial effort
even though it may be
scary, and it’ll pay itself
back in a big way.
A good thing to do is to
try and establish multiple
semi-independent social
groups: your halls friends,
your course friends, and
your society friends. This
is useful if you accidental-
ly leave a metal spoon in
that bowl of soup you’re
microwaving and the
whole thing explodes and
now everyone in halls
can’t talk to you without
making soup puns. If
this happens, take refuge
in a different group,
isolated from soup-related
catastrophes, and count
your blessings for having
multiple robust social
support structures.
Aim for a 2:1 in first
year
Grades in first year may
not count (or count very
little) towards your final
degree, but they reflect
more than just your marks.
First year is when you’re
learning how to learn at
university. It’s a very dif-
ferent style from second-
ary education, and getting
a handle on it in first year
sets you up for success
in the remaining years of
your degree. To be clear:
no-one expects you to be
making perfect notes in
the first week of lectures –
or even in your last week
– and no-one expects
you to have it completely
worked out by the end of
first year. Developing your
personal learning style
is essentially a process
of trial and error that
never stops. You’re never
may be an internship or
placement, or even a little
project on something
unrelated to your degree.
Either way, opportunities
for summer abound, but
you have to be looking
out for them. Have this
in the back of your mind
throughout the year, and
don’t be afraid to inquire
when you hear about
something potentially cool
going on in the summer.
There’s every chance it’ll
help you figure out what
you may want to do after
you get that pretty piece
of paper at the end of your
time at university.
Keep an ear out for
potential housing op-
tions
Where you live in
second year, and who
you live with, can make
a big difference to your
experience. You don’t
need to worry about this
until about halfway to
two-thirds through the
year, but thinking about
it sooner rather than later
can save you potentially
large amounts of aggro
and stress. Having a rough
idea about the people you
want to live with provides
that feeling that it’ll likely
turn out OK and you’ll
have a good second year,
even if you can’t get your
dream-home.
So, follow these tips,
my dear freshers, and
you’ll be on the path to
having a better time than
if you didn’t. Even if you
don’t follow these tips,
take heart from this: loads
of people have gone to uni
before you, and loads of
people will do it after you,
and everyone finds it hard
at some point. The fact that
you’re here means that
you’re capable, and very
likely to have a great time
and do well. Welcome to
Imperial, and have fun!
Tip number 5: Join Felix // ICU
gonna know if any way of
learning is ‘the best’, so
you should just focus on
getting a 2:1 in first year.
If you achieve that, then
whatever method you’re
using can’t be that bad,
and you’ll develop good
habits that’ll carry into the
rest of your degree.
Be looking out for op-
portunities for sum-
mer
The summers between
university years are a
small nirvana for students.
You’re technically a full
adult now, with mates and
a good chunk of time in
which to do cool things.
One of those cool things
