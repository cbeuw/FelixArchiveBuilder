Rick and Morty – back where we started?

W
hile offer-
ing some
great ad-
v e n t u r e s ,
this season lands be-
tween the previous two,
as more time is devoted
to the resolution of ex-
isting plot lines than the
creation of new ones.
Some might argue that
this is a natural develop-
ment of overarching plot
lines introduced in earli-
er episodes – which this
season executes stun-
ningly in The Ricklan-
tis Mixup – but I see as
Harmon’s and Roiland’s
writing catching up to
them.
The driving theme of
this season is Beth and
Jerry’s divorce, and Morty,
Summer, and Rick’s place
in the resulting family
unit. Unfortunately, each
of this years stories serves
the end goal of reaching
the resolution of Beth
and Jerry’s divorce. It’s
this rush to resolve this
plotline by the end of the
season that pushes what
could have been fantastic
standalone adventures to
the side, instead making
them slaves to the season’s
narrative.
Cast your minds back to
early April, when Roiland
and Harmon teased us
with an early April Fool’s
episode, one devoted to
breaking one of our titular
characters out of a mind
prison. For four months
we were left up the creek
without any zany, nihil-
istic, Sci-Fi paddles. It is
maybe because of this time
between this first episode
and the rest that leaves
The Rickshank Rickdemp-
tion feeling more like the
second half of last year’s
finale, rather than a fresh
start to season three.
Season three doesn’t
really kick off until the
third episode, Pickle Rick,
which is a fairly bread and
butter episode that would
fit thematically into any of
the three seasons. Like The
Whirly Dirly Conspiracy
and Rest and Ricklaxation,
this is as close as we get to
a true standalone episode
this year. Still, Rick spends
most of this episode
avoiding dealing with the
issue of his daughter’s
divorce, something I wish
the shows creators would
have done too.
Episode continuity can
be a fantastic way to keep a
may have made the series
so successful to begin
with, the actual result is
to render many of the key
plot points irrelevant.
Perhaps realising this
shortcoming, we are
treated to what is easily
one of the strongest and
most complex episodes yet
in The Ricklantis Mixup.
The gimmick of having
every character be a Rick
or a Morty is much more
than that, as having these
blank canvases allows
them to both assume
cultural tropes and remain
recognisable and familiar.
The fact that the episode
is literally Justin Roiland
talking to himself for 23
minutes takes nothing
away from the density of
storytelling in this episode.
It culminates in a dramatic
dolly out, accompanied by
the recurring theme for the
series’ darkest moments
Do You Feel It? which
eagle-eared fans might
remember from that time
Rick tried to kill himself.
Placing this episode in
the middle of the season,
however, is like having
your cake before your
steak, especially as the
season ends on a dry,
unremarkable tale that
could have fit into any
part of the season, save
for the fact that Beth and
Jerry finally get over their
throughout the season.
However, the small
insights into Morty’s
deleted memories we do
get is lighthearted and fun.
Well, as lighthearted as
a story about a suspected
peaodophile’s suicide can
get.
The last episode is a
thematic continuation
of The ABC’s of Beth,
the first real time Beth’s
character complexity is
actually explored. This de-
velopment comes across
as retroactive considering
we have known these
characters for 28 episodes
already. However, it does
also serve to end the
season, with a disposable
taleaboutthePresidentand
return to both the family
and premise we loved in
the first two seasons. Let’s
just hope that this season
was a necessary evil for
Rick and Morty’s return to
the quality we had come to
expect.
Catch the last episode
of Season 3 on Netflix and
Adult Swim this Sunday, if
you haven’t pirated it like
you should have done.
Everyone’s favourite neglectful Grandfather has graced our screens and left almost as schwiftly as he arrived with
a season that presses the reset button on last years finale

show feeling like a living,
breathing world. But when
the last episode negates
the whole reason we have
spent so much time on the
development of our char-
acters it feels cheap and
frustrating, as we know
how good this show can
be at its best. Whether to
start afresh with the many
story opportunities that
a full family offers, or an
attempt to recapture what
“A dry,

tale that would

irritating divorce. The
disappointing climax has
led to many fans specu-
lating that there are more
episodes to be released,
and that the season isn’t
really over. As much as
I’d like to believe this too,
to do so is to make the
same error that befell fans
of Sherlock, and afford
an initially promising
showrunner far too much
credit. Sometimes a dis-
appointing ending really is
just that.
While I appreciate
Harmon and Roiland’s
twist on a clip show,
cramming all of this
season’s standalone
adventures into Morty’s
Mindblowers was short
sighted, as they would
have been welcome as
fully fledged episodes
