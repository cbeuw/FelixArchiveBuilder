FashSoc bashed and smashed in antifa fracas
HANGMAN
A violent brawl broke
out at the Freshers’
Fair this week, as
antifascist activists
targeted a student
society.

D
uring the fair
last Tuesday,
a little after
2pm, antifa
activists stormed Fash-
ion Society’s stall in
Beit Quad. Wearing bal-
aclavas and black boots,
they started attacking
students who tried to
defend the stall, and
set fire to the society’s
banner. Security were
the stall before it was
completely destroyed, as
they “got distracted by
the Spotify igloo – they
were giving away hats”.
It is believed that the
activists were from Im-
perial Left Forum, who
were placed with the arts
societies in Beit Quad,
rather than the other polit-
ical groups. “We’d just set
up our stall,” said Thomas
Rhidian, head of the Left
Forum, “when we started
hearing freshers talk about
‘FashSoc’. We asked them
where the stall was, and
they pointed to the other
side of the Quad. Before
you could say ‘five year
plan’, we’d donned our
antifa kit, and made our
way over there”.
Eye-witnesses say the
activists were chanting
‘bash the fash’ as they
approached the table,
brandishing weapons from
the nearby IC Artisans
Workshop stall.
The head of Fashion
Soc, Aimee Chaslow,
spoke to Felix: “it was
completely terrifying.
We were just trying to
get freshers interested in
pleather peplums when
these masked hooligans
started ripping up our leaf-
lets and tipping over our
table. I thought they were
from PETA, so I started
trying to explain it was all
faux-fur, but they punched
me in the jaw”.
Another member of
Fashion Soc, who didn’t
wish to be named, said
“yeah, I’m a fan of Hugo
Boss’ suits, but none of
that Nazi stuff. I don’t
know why they attacked
us”.
Felix spoke to Imperial
Left Forum’s two other
members, who gave
conflicting reports of the
violence: “there was a lot
of confusion, but as soon
as I saw that they were
more interested in vintage
fairs than authoritarian
governments, I stepped
back” said one; “yeah, I
knew who they were,” said
the other, “but the fashion
industry is a paradigm
exemplar of Marx’s theory
of commodity fetishism,
so I just carried on.”
In total three students
had to be taken to hospital,
and a number of freshers
required support from
the counselling service
for emotional distress.
They’ve been put on the
waiting list.
“Security
were called
immediately,
but were
distracted by
the Spotify
igloo”
called immediately by
concerned students, but
were unable to reach
“Activists
were chanting
‘bash the
fash’as they
approached
the stall”

Union opens “biggest election ever”, with over 9,000
positions available
HANGMAN ISSUE 2
O
n Tuesday
morning, in
an email sent
to all students
at Imperial, the Union
announced their plans
to increase the positions
available from 412 to
9,426, enough for every
single undergraduate
student to have a role.
Nominations opened
today, and will remain
open for the next two
weeks. Following this,
there will be a week dur-
ing which students can
vote through the Union
website, before results
night on Friday 20th
October. Attendance is
mandatory for all Im-
perial undergraduates,
but a drinks token for a
half-pint of Bud Light
will be provided to all
attendees.
Any roles that remain
unfilled will be randomly
assigned to students who
don’t have one, meaning
that by the beginning
of November every
undergraduate student will
have a role in the Union.
New roles that have been
created include Vice Vice
Vice Vice Vice Secretary
(PhotoSoc), Extra-Or-
dinary Council Member
Chair of ‘Deepening
Democracy’ Forum, said
that he was “exhilarated”
by the changes, which
were inspired by the
Soviet Union’s policy of
full employment: “these
elections really show that
your Union is completely
committed to firing up
our democracy. Whereas
before students would
have to make their con-
cerns known through their
elected representatives,
after these elections we’ll
have completely direct
democracy, and give stu-
dents the means to repre-
sent themselves. We want
to show that we are com-
mitted to the democratic
principle ‘one person, one
vote, one union role.’”
However, not everyone
was as excited about the
changes. An anonymous
source from the Union
expressed their concerns
to Felix, claiming that
the Union would not be
able to cope with the
sheer number of student
I don’t think the Union
has the infrastructure to be
able to support that many
students – the flooring of
the Union Dining Hall, for
example, would need to
be reinforced if there are
going to be 2,000 new or-
dinary council members”
A student also raised
issues with the logistics of
the new election format:
“before, I only had to
cope with about 30 friends
sending me Facebook
invitations pleading me
to vote for them, but now
I’ve got over 8,000 events
on my calendar, and my
phone’s logic board has
completely melted’.
There are still no can-
didates for President (Jazz
and Rock Society).
