Chasing kaleidoscopic corals in Jordan’s Red Sea
Linking up with the Gulf of Aqaba’s undisputed coral conservation leaders

T
his summer
marked the re-
lease of Chasing
Coral on Netflix
UK. The documentary
follows a group of divers
and scientists document-
ing disappearing coral
reefs across the globe. The
team used the technology
behind Google’s Street
View to create a set of
360-degree images, allow-
ing anyone with internet
access to take virtual dives
at world-class dive spots.
They also conducted sur-
veys to better understand
changing reef health.
The cause of the
disappearing reefs and,
arguably, the largest
current threat to reef eco-
systems is coral bleaching,
a phenomenon caused by
rising water temperatures.
When water becomes
too warm, coral polyps
expel their symbiotic
algae. Without the energy
provided by the algae
many corals starve, with
knock-on consequences
for the rest of the ecosys-
tem. Unfortunately this
is an increasing problem,
with 2016 having one
of the longest and most
severe global bleaching
events on record.
One area that has thus
far been spared is the Red
Sea. In spite of the high
temperatures experienced
throughout the summer,
the majority of corals have
managed to avoid bleach-
ing entirely, although
some localised outbreaks
have been reported. As a
result it has been proposed
that these corals could
help to regenerate coral
communities in other lo-
cations that have been lost
due to bleaching.
This highlights the crit-
icality of protecting such
ecosystems, and luckily
the corals here appear to be
more bleach-resistant than
most. Yet despite their re-
silience when it comes to
bleaching, Red Sea corals
do face threats in the form
of unsustainable shipping
practices and increases in
tourism. If the area is not
fully protected, we there-
fore risk losing not only a
beautiful ecosystem, but
also an invaluable bank
of corals that could help
to mitigate the impact of
future bleaching events.
Enter Ahlan Aqaba
Scuba Diving Center.
Owner Shadi Hatoky and
his team are the only PADI
centre in the area with a
Green Star Award, thanks
to their collaborations
with Project AWARE in-
novatives to conduct reef
health surveys and – most
importantly – actively
rid dive sites of trash.
Upcoming partnerships
include educational
projects with the Royal
Marine Conservation
Society to improve public
understanding of conser-
vation. Ahlan Aqaba are
leading by example when
it comes to protecting the
local area, and are also
now offering internships
for divers intending to
acquire that coveted Dive-
master certification.
Aside from the encour-
aging conservation efforts
underway, the diving in
the Red Sea is world class.
There are generally no
strong currents, palatable
water temperatures, and
excellent visibility. The
spots on offer include
the majestic Japanese
Gardens, whose kaleido-
scope of colour will keep
you entertained for as long
as your tank has oxygen.
There’s also a shipwreck,
best explored by night,
followed by a top deck
barbecue and late night
boat party. Overall, Aqaba
is a fantastic place to
spend a few days getting
lost beneath the waves.

Hopping to the stars and beyond
K
nown for ever-
lasting stretches
of desert and a
monopoly on
marsupials, Australia is
not a country commonly
affiliated with the space
above us. But this is set
to change in 2018: the
Australian government
have announced the
country will launch a
national space agency,
bringing them in line
with other countries like
Canada (and importantly
New Zealand).
The government said
the development of a
national agency will
assist Australian efforts
in the global $330 billion
space industry, and hopes
the move will focus the
country’s economy on
innovation and science
activities. But it has said
little else.
With no budget or
specific aims the agency’s
announcement seems a
little premature. This is
not to say, though, that
they aren’t involved in
the world of space-related
sciences. Australia rapidly
jumped on the satellite
bandwagon back in 1967
and images of astronaut
Neil Armstrong’s first
steps on the moon were
transmitted by NASA’s
Honeysuckle Creek
tracking station inAustral-
ia. Since then, however,
governments have stalled
at the prospect of creating
a space agency because of
the related cost.
Prime Minister
Malcolm Turnbull con-
firmed the agency would
be “small”, though it is
not yet clear how much
money will be allocated.
The government indi-
cated the costing would
be included in the 2018
federal Budget.
So, what exactly is a
‘space agency’? And why
would a country that has
had been happily without
for half a century choose
now to form one?
A space agency is an
official organisation that
brings space exploration
and satellite technology
under one branch of
national government. As
expected, of the 71 coun-
tries with space agencies,
no two run theirs exactly

the same, and each have
slightly differing priorities.
Australia currently
relies on data collated by
other countries’ satellites.
This includes data used for
security and surveillance
purposes. Under a national
agency ,the 11,500 people
working in the space
industry would be able to
record their own data and
Australia would have more
control over the informa-
tion collected. Starting
up the agency will not
be an easy or cheap task.
However there is clearly
space for improvement.
