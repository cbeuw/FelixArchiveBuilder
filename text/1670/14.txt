B
ass legend Les
Claypool returns
with the only
band to earn
its own ID3 genre tag.
The band is known for
off-kilter prog-funk with
metal roots. Trademark
syncopated riffs return
with newfound min-
imalism. This album
conceptually focuses on
the “desaturating seven”,
a band of goblins who
chase rainbows and eat
their colors, as based on
Ul de Rico’s The Rainbow
Goblins. The album under-
delivers; while the concept
is interesting, this is clear-
ly not Primus’s best work.
Good for completionists
and Primus superfans.

W
olf Alice is
a band with
a diverse set
of influenc-
es. There are detectable
traces of shoegaze, pop,
folk, punk, grunge, and
indie, to name just a few
components of the musical
palette brought to bear on
this album.
There is never a dull
minute as Ellie Roswell
& co. leap from phrase
to phrase, always finding
a fresh way to voice a
line. Roswell’s singing
has remarkable range,
and everything from the
silkiest harmony to the
wildest shriek can be
found.
The crew behind the
album has undoubtably
managed to put together
one of the most sonically
interesting indie releases
this year.
“The album
underdelivers:
it’s clearly not
Primus’s best
work”
