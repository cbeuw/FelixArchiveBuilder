Is Elon Musk Big Brother?

O
ur story begins
with the jelly-
fish, the first
animal to have
a nervous system – or
rather a nervous net. An
animal without a nervous
net can’t respond to its
environment, so its odds
of survival could be
likened to flipping a coin.
Having one was a real
breakthrough.
Later on, the flatworm
developed a central
nervous system, realizing
that it was more efficient
to turn decision making
into a centralised process.
From that point on, the
animal nervous system
grew and matured, gaining
the limbic system, the ne-
ocortex, and more blocks
that would eventually
form the brains of the first
humans. One of those
humans, approximately
50,000 years ago, came up
with the idea of associat-
ing sounds with physical
objects – language – and
our collective knowledge
as a species took a giant
leap. Then came writing,
and human progress
became seemingly expo-
nential, continuing to this
day. Yet according to one
man, we aren’t developing
quickly enough: enter
Elon Musk.
50,000 years have
passed since that memo-
rable discovery; humanity
has been to the moon and
possesses the power to
destroy the very planet it
was born on. Yet when it
comes to communication,
we’re using millennia old
technology to get our ideas
across. The idea behind
Neuralink’s first
products are to be implants
restoring motor skills to
those that lost them to
severe brain injuries, but
just like humanity itself
they are set to develop far
beyond that
Seemingly, Musk’s
vision entails humanity
becoming a species of
invisible cyborgs. Sounds
great, but where’s the
catch?
Arguably, Neuralink is
Musk’s most ambitious
venture to date. For one,
the human brain remains
the most powerful and ver-
satile supercomputer in the
known universe, running
on less power than most
laptops. A good explana-
tion for why we have such
a hard time understanding
our brains boils down to
this quote by Dr. Moran
Cerf, “If the human brain
were so simple that we
would understand it, we
would be so simple that
we couldn’t”.
Ultimately, the greatest
challenge we may face
as a species could be
understanding not some
outlandish technology, but
rather ourselves.
Technological hurdles
aside, it turns out not
everyone is ready to jump
the gun on becoming a
cyborg. In a 2016 survey,
69% of Americans stated
that they were “worried”
by the prospect of brain
chipimplantsforimproved
cognitive abilities. Often
associated with a loss of
privacy, brain implants
still generate more scep-
ticism than anything else
at the intersection of tech
and biology. Elon Musk
claims to be no Orwellian
Big Brother, but whether
anyone will believe that
remains to be seen.
The world is becoming
increasingly more digital,
but the question remains
of whether digitalizing
our thoughts is the natural
next step in that evolution.
The fact that someone is
determined enough to try
and find out is something
to cherish.

“When it
comes to com-
munication
we’re using
millennia old
technology to
get our ideas
across”
“It turns out
not everyone
is ready to
jump the gun
on becoming a
cyborg just”
brain-machine interfaces
is that there must be a
faster way to exchange
thoughts than reading and
writing.
This is where Neural-
ink comes into play: it
promises to free humanity
from the need to verbalize
our thoughts and allow
multiple brains to work on
problems without the need
for explicit communica-
tion as if they were one.
Musk calls this “essential-
ly consensual telepathy”.
