Bold, vibrant, poignant: the unrealised genius of Jean-

ailed as a
‘radiant child’,
Jean-Michel
B a s q u i a t
erupted onto the 1980s
New York art scene in as
a teenager. He was just 18
when he began to scrawl
poetic graffiti on the
streets of New York with
one of his school friends
Al Diaz as SAMO© – a
contraction of ‘same old,
same old shit’. When the
duo were exposed as the
figures behind SAMO©,
Basquiat turned to creating
art under his own name,
first hawking handmade
postcards outside New
York’s galleries, and then
working on large scale
canvases.. His primitivist,
neo-expressionist paint-
ings drew the admiration
of everyone from Keith
Haring to Andy Warhol.
His raw, exuberant style
paired with his tragically
short career – there was
little more than half a
decade between his first
solo show and his death
at the age of twenty-seven
from an heroin overdose,
has mythologised Basquiat
into the annals of modern
art history.
The photographs of
SAMO© reveal Basquiat
and Diaz’nascent attempts
to shed light on inequality
and their frustration at the
lack of diversity in the
art world through art, and
sometimes cryptic tags.
“Which institutions hold
most political power?”
reads one: “the church,
television, SAMO or
McDonald’s?” (the box
for McDonald’s is ticked),
“SAMO as an end to
9-to-5, ‘I went to college’,.
‘not 2-nite honey’ bluz
think”. Basquiat’s can-
vasses translate the insou-
ciance of his graffiti into a
host of brilliantly vibrant
paintings – a hastily
daubed double portrait of
himself and Warhol is not
technically brilliant such
fizzes with a magnetic
energy.
The rooms towards the
end of the exhibition, filled
with works from the end
of his career are the most
compelling. These show
the artist gaining maturity.
Basquiat never went to art
school but his voracious
appetite for learning from
the art canon is evident.
His adoption of elements
from Picasso and Cy
Twombly’s work is easy
to spot, yet Basquiat’s
affinity for the non-West-
ern canon seems to have
influenced him the most.
His thick pastel linework,
heavy with scratchings,
figures jutting into patches
of solid colour seem
sculptural, reminiscent
of African tribal rock
carvings.
In his later works
Basquiat’s began to
explore the themes of
race in America in greater
depth; references to
slavery, the cotton and
sugar trade abound. His
work also became more
contemplative. In one of
the most striking pieces of
the exhibition – Jawbone
of an Ass is a rumination
on the futility of violence,
and its ubiquitousness
in world history. The
struggle between Africa

“His paintings
translate the
insouciance
of his graffiti
into brilliantly
vibrant
canvasses”
“We are left
with the sense
that Basquiat
is still trying to
synthesise his
thoughts ”
and the Western world is
illustrated by references to
the legendary Carthagin-
ian general Hannibal and
the Roman consul Scipio,
under whose command
Carthage was defeated.
There is often too much
to unpack, whole lists of
seemingly random people,
places and things appear
together in one canvas –
everyone from Vasco da
Gama to Malcolm X to
big trucks of strawberries
are referenced. We are
left with the sense that
Basquiat himself is trying
to synthesise his thoughts,
painting as he thinks,
making connections,
drawing threads of conclu-
sion that aren’t altogether
clear to him, let alone to
us.
His notebooks, where
he set down ideas and
refined the poetry he’d
later graffiti are espe-
cially poignant. For all
the breadth of assembled
pieces, the spectre of
work unfinished hangs
over the exhibition. I kept
turning corners expecting
one flash of brilliance to
bring it all together, but it
never came. Instead, what
emerges is a picture of an
artist with tremendous po-
tential still figuring things
out; a voice silenced
before he had said all that
he wanted to .

Edinburgh Fringe: celebrating diversity and genius
ARTS

h i l e
studying in
Edinburgh,
I got the
impression that this
usually mild-mannered,
quietly beautiful city takes
on a completely different
personality every August.
Students who had been
around in August spoke
of the Royal Mile being
flooded with tourists, the
impossibility of getting
anywhere, the buoyant
merriment and perma-
nently festive atmosphere,
with street performers
around every corner and
everything staying open
till 4am. Naturally, I des-
perately wanted to experi-
ence all that. Thus, a few
months ago I managed to
make it up north for the
last few days of the Fringe,
and was overwhelmed by
the levels of energy and
creativity concentrated in
one city.
Established in 1947, the
Fringe is now the world’s
largest arts festival, with
53,232 performances of
3,398 shows in 300 venues
at the festival this year.
Billed as an open event
welcoming performers
and groups from all over
the world, the Fringe is
especially known for its
diversity, with shows
spanning across the
genres of theatre, comedy,
improv, spoken word,
dance, physical theatre,
circus, cabaret, musicals
and everything in between.
It is also known as the
place for newcomers to
break out and be noticed.
The festival celebrates
both the mainstream and
the alternative, the edgy
and the family-friendly,
the well-established acts
and the newcomers.
When I stepped out of
the train, what caught my
attention most was how
every inch of available
wall was covered with
colourful posters of any
size. ‘Strong and Stable
Productions present
Brexit: The Musical’ one
declared. Extra fences had
been set up for the purpose
of accommodating the
infinite number of posters.
What I found most
attractive, however,
was the constant festive
atmosphere penetrating
every corner of the city.
Walking around the
city that was at once so
familiar yet to foreign, it
felt like everyone was in a
merry mood. The gardens
in which I spent countless
hours lying on the grass
revising had transformed
into the giant street food
and bar area, with fairy
lights strung across. Every
street revealed a new
surprise venue, pubs that
I never knew existed were
suddenly hosting stand-up
comedy shows.
Initially worried that
I did not have a detailed
plan of what to see at what
time on which day, I even-
tually realised that those
fears were unfounded and
in fact it was a blessing
in disguise that I had not
planned what to see. In
my four days there, I saw
ten shows, and it was
those that I spontaneously
walked into that turned out
the most impressive.
One of these impressive
surpriseswasTheCrossing
Place by Romantika, a
theatre company founded
in Estonia but now oper-
ating across Sweden and
the UK. I was handed a
flyer and saw that it was
‘a visual theatre piece
based on the poetry of
Tomas Tranströmer’, and
immediately decided I
was going to see it – I love
Tranströmer’spoetry.Min-
imalistic and powerful,
the piece was performed
on a top-floor studio
space, and consisted of
three identically-dressed
men using energetic,
full-body movements and
intense facial expressions
to convey the themes of
loneliness, monotony
and loss in Tranströmer’s
words, which they recite
at the same time.
Another show I saw
as a result of a flyer was
the Reduced Shakespeare
Company, which I had
wanted to see since I
was a secondary school
student in English class
being shown their version
of Romeo and Juliet. That
was a wonderful case of
childhood dream come
true unexpectedly, and
they did not disappoint,
delivering a hilarious
amalgamation of Shake-
spearean tropes and plots
in his alleged ‘first play’.
Of all the shows I saw,
however, the one that
impacted me the most and
which I found the most
insightful and technically
brilliant was Mouthpiece,
a collaboration from
Canada between Quote
Unquote Collective and
Why Not Theatre. The
set is simple – the stage is
completely empty except
for a plain, white bathtub
at the centre, and two
women dressed in identi-
cal white strappy leotards.
The two women perform
the conversation within
the character, who has just
lost her mother the night
before and has to now go
about her day choosing her
mother’s casket, her dress
for burial, and arranging
the service. In an expertly
executed and beauti-
fully precise sequence
of a capella harmony,
dissonance, physicality,
lighting and text, the
struggles of the modern
woman are revealed by the
scintillating performances
of Amy Nostbakken and
Norah Sadava, as the
protagonist reflects on her
mother’s death and her
subsequent tasks. I am
usually not a fan of ‘nasty
women’ art that shouts too
loudly in one’s face, but
this was a subtle, elegant
and nuanced portrayal of
the female psyche, quietly
angry in the precision of
its performance.
The Fringe provides
something for everyone,
and is a holistic artistic
experience as a whole. As
a wellspring of passion
and creativity, I found it
inspirational and hearten-
ing, and will definitely be
returning for more.
This writer’s virgin Fringe experience was marked by unexpected childhood dreams come true, favourite poetry
come to life, and an overdose of creative genius.
