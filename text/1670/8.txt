and really enjoyed it.
A: Is your interest in
drama purely a hob-
by, or do you see it as
a future career? And if
the latter, why are you
studying Mech Eng at
all?
O: I like the idea of it be-
ing a future career; the
glamour of being a profes-
sional in the film or thea-
tre world. I have looked
around for jobs in the the-
atre sector – acting, direct-
ing, getting into writing at
a ground level – by send-
ing out works I’ve done
and seeing if people like it,
and I’ve looked for jobs in
engineering. But I priori-
tise the engineering.
I’m in the position of
enjoying my subject as
well as really enjoying the
drama I do on the side. I
wouldn’t mind a career
in either, but a job in en-
gineering would be a lot
more profitable and safe.
If I went into engineering
I’d still do a lot of drama
in my spare time and if I
went into drama I’d still

my spare time.*
enjoyable. I’ve not been
trawling towards the end
of the degree wishing it to
end. But there are people
I know who have started
their degrees and fallen
so in love with acting,
writing and directing that
they’ve left after two
years and gone to acting
school. And a lot have
been success stories. I
think a lot of that stems
from the fact we’re in the
theatre capital of Europe.
It’s intoxicating. And to be
at a STEM university with
no competition from those
studying arts, it’s easy to
get taken away with that.
I’m lucky enough to be
able to appreciate both
sides of that life.

burning passion for fixing

Rhodes must fall: a passionate retelling of a real-life
student revolution
T
old through a se-
ries of compelling
monologues, The
Fall is a drama-
tisation of the real events
surrounding a group of
activist students studying
at the University of Cape
Town (UCT), several dec-
ades after apartheid. Spe-
cifically, it tells the sto-
ry behind the fall of the
statue of colonialist Cecil
Rhodes, which stood for
years outside the Universi-
ty as a staunch reminder of
the violent events that un-
folded over a century ago.
Through the discussions
and personal accounts
given by the seven-strong
ensemble cast, the ma-
jor issues affecting their
lives as regular students
are explored. Through a
clash of personalities the
significance of race, class,
patriarchy and gender in
modern-day South Africa
raises questions on how
to bridge the gaps in-be-
tween through dialogue
about decolonisation.
Written by the cast
- who are playing them-
selves, the play draws on
their own experiences,
building a deep narrative
surrounding the events
that happened.
Each cast member has
a definitive attitude, and
tells the story in a way that
reflects their own iden-
tity; be it the headstrong
Boitshoko who comical-
ly wants to take on the
statue using “a chisel and
hammer”, to the young
Chwaita who is strug-
gling to find her voice in
the group, constantly ask-
ing questions about what
exactly they’re striving
for. Lead by the incredi-
ble Zandile Madliwa as
the leader of the Black
Radical Feminist move-
ment, and Cleo Raatus as
a non-binary council rep,
the play lights up with in-
tensity when the students
confront each other and
begin to find deeper un-
derstanding through a se-
ries of strongly worded ar-
guments. Ameera Conrad,
who plays Camilla, was
particularly impressive
during her fiery speech
that divides the group and
thrusts gender issues into
the limelight.
The scenes are inter-
spersed with impressive
choreography and tradi-
tional song, echoing the
strong collective spir-
it they have as a group
to address the needs of
their country. In the short
space of 80 minutes, the
audience were taken on a
roller coaster of emotions,
laughing at the naivety of
questions and comedic
chides to crying alongside
characters forced to make
difficult moral decisions.
Projections of the real-life
protests that happened fol-
lowing the #RhodesMust-
Fall movement centre the
play synchronously along-
side the history of the
movements.
Whilst the stories are
told with colour and pas-
sion, the way they are ef-
fortlessly interweaved to
follow a historically-ac-
curate narrative makes
you come out of it feeling
just as enlightened as you
were entertained. There’s

never a dull moment, as
the writing is fast-paced,
thought-provoking and
deeply emotional. All in
all, this ensemble produc-
tion is full of heart, and
boldly speaks out for the
strength in student revolu-
tions around the world.

Clash of cultures: can the arts thrive in the science-
dominated campus of Imperial?
‘The arts’ is not a phrase that springs to mind when you think of Imperial. But as it turns out, there are a bunch of
arts-loving, STEM-studying students here. In the first of a series of interviews on the topic, Arts Editor Adam Gellatly
interviews DramSoc President Oscar Gill.
ARTS
Adam Gellatly
Arts Editor
O
scar Gill is a 4th
year Mech Eng
Student and
sitting President
of Imperial DramSoc. He
was also my flatmate for
2 years and we’re right
old chums. We sat down
over a mediocre cup of
SCR coffee to discuss his
relationship with the arts
while studying at Imperial.
Adam: Can you brief-
ly describe what arts
you’re interested in
and how you’re in-
volved with the arts
at Imperial?
Oscar: I’m interested in
the performing arts, and
in particular, theatre; so
that’s anything from mu-
sicals, to comedies, to
Shakespeare. I got inter-
ested in it quite a while
ago. My entire family are
thespians, everybody’s
come from some theatri-
cal background. I was in-
volved [in theatre] quite a
lot growing up, but during
my A-Levels I didn’t do
anything at all and felt re-
ally bad about it. So, when
I went into 1st
year, I was
really determined to get
into a play as soon as I
could. I found the Imperi-
al Dramatic Society and it
went from there.
Now, as the President I
executive produce every
single DramSoc show that
is performed during my
tenure; making sure there’s
a production team, and a
producer and director that
work together. As well as
that my duties extend to
managing the committee,
which consists of the
acting and technical side.
A: There’s a percep-
tion from the outside
that Imperial stu-
dents are only inter-
ested in their chosen
STEM degree. Can
you talk more about
your own experience
of balancing interests
in Mech Eng and the
performing arts?
O: A lot of people tend
to mix their skills from
their degree with what
they do in their clubs and
societies. I like to keep
them completely sepa-
rate. Everything I do in
Mechanical Engineering
is different to what I do in
Drama. And I like that di-
vide; it means I can take a
break from one and do the

other.
Other people definitely
view us as a STEM uni-
versity and that’s tricky
at times. When you come
here you don’t expect
arts to be a big thing, but
it really is. I feel that the
most when DramSoc goes
to the Edinburgh Fringe
Festival. ICL has almost
no name to work with and
it’s difficult to get over
that perception of being
at STEM university and
proving that we are artis-
tically talented.
A: How do you get
over that?
O: In recent years, we’ve
tried to massively expand
our image over London by
taking part in the London
Student Drama Festival.
All the colleges in London
get together and compete
with a piece of drama writ-
ten by themselves. All of
them are critiqued by pro-
fessional writers and crit-
ics. It allows us to show
what Imperial is made of
and mingle with the other
universities, which I think
is very important in cre-
ating the image of arts at
Imperial as being a ‘real’
thing.
A: Do you think the
quality of Imperial’s
dramatic output suf-
fers from the fact that
no one studies acting,
or writing here?
O: I think it can be prob-
lematic. But we’re not try-
ing to put out the highest
quality drama as STEM
students. The society is
an amateur theatre group
and quality is something
we aspire to. At times it’s
hard to achieve that, not
because of the people we
have – because we have
talented people – but be-
cause of the time commit-
ments people have with
their subjects. Degrees
like medicine, like engi-
neering, are very full-on
and don’t leave a lot of
time for people to practice
and improve their artistic
side.
A: When you look at
a group like the Cam-
bridge Footlights,
who also have non-
arts members, they
seem to have an aim
to produce high-qual-
ity material. Do you
think at Imperial it’s
less about that and
more about the ‘club’
aspect of the society?
O: To an extent, yes. The
Cambridge Footlights
have a tendency to pro-
duce high-quality stuff,
but they also have the
expectation to do so. But
having seen a lot of the
Footlights productions at
the Fringe this year, I can
say that a lot of it is sub-
standard. They’re in a sim-
ilar boat to us – working
hard on their degrees – but
they also have the pres-
tige. We don’t have that,
and although that’s unfor-
tunate, it takes a lot of the
pressure off. So essential-
ly, you’re right, we’re a
club. People need to join
it not with the aspiration
of producing something
that is ground-breaking,
but because they want to
have fun with it and want
to create something they
haven’t had a chance to
before.
A: Do you find your
fellow actors are like
you, in that this is
something they’ve
done before, or do
most have zero acting
experience?
O: It varies. Maybe 70:30
to people who have act-
ed before. But the way I
look at it, anyone can act,
it doesn’t take a lot. I’ve
sold it people on that be-
fore, and people with no
experience have tried it
