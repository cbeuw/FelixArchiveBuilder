Tories introduce plans for tuition fee freeze
NEWS
Theresa May made
the announcement at
the party conference
in Manchester in an
attempt to win back
young voters.

Theresa May has
announced that tuition
fees will be frozen at
a maximum of £9,250
a year until 2019. The
government will also raise
the threshold at which
loans must be paid back
to £25,000. Announced
at the Conservative party
conference in Manchester,
the pledges are part of an
£11 billion drive to win
over young voters follow-
ing their disappointing
election results, which
saw them lose 13 seats and
their majority.
Describing the fee
freeze as part of a “mission
to make the UK a fairer
place” may allow Theresa
May to dodge accusations
of another U-turn. The
original plan would have
seen tuition costs rise
yet again next year to a
maximum £9,500 a year.
As part of the Teaching
Excellence Framework
(TEF), universities with
gold and silver ratings
would be able to raise
their fees in line with
inflation. Institutions with
a bronze rating would also
be allowed to increase
their costs but only by up
to 50% of the inflationary
uplift. Putting these plans
on ice raises doubts about
the value universities will
place on achieving a good
TEF rating in the absence
of a financial incentive.
If the fee cap is main-
tained in the long term,
average student debt
could fall from £50,600 to
£49,800. According to the
Institute for Fiscal Studies,
77% of current graduates
will not fully repay their
student loans before the 30
year write off point. The
latest proposals, which
will slash average lifetime
repayments by around
£10,000, will see 83% of
graduates failing to pay
back the total amount.
This means the only
ones who will benefit from
the tuition cost freeze are
the highest earners. An
extra 6% will no longer
repay the full amount of
their debt before having it
written off. The 17% that
do completely pay back
their loans will repay a
lower amount overall.
Raising the repayment
threshold will have an
immediate impact on
those earning £21,000
to £25,000. Low-earners
(who are already unlikely
to pay back the full amount
of their loan) will now
repay even less before
having their student debt
written off. According to
The Times, this represents
a saving of around £1 each
day. Those with salaries
of £26,500 will save £500
a year. However it is the
middle-earners who will
benefit the most, some
to the tune of £15,700
according to the IFS.
The proposals were
heralded as a “revolution”
– enthusiastically in The
Telegraph and sarcastical-
ly in The Mirror. Labour
dubbed the changes
“desperate” and claimed
that the Conservatives
have “no plans for young
people”. More generally,
the reception has been
lukewarm with many
welcoming the move but
warning that much more
must be done.
Theresa May may have
preempted this with her
suggestion of holding a
much wider review into
tuition fees. This could
include the return of
maintenance grants, as
revealed this week in an
“exclusive” by i (although
