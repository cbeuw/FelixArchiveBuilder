Mad about the boy: Jane Eyre returns to the NT
ARTS

ane Eyre opens with
a scream – it’s one of
the moments I think
most after I leave the
theatre. It is at once all the
things I find difficult about
the performance, and what
seems essential to the
spirit of the original novel
which is itself a howl for
women’s independence
and self-determination.
Adapting any novel as
concerned with a single
protagonist’s inner expe-
riences as Jane Eyre is an
unenviable task. Director
Sally Cookson has tackled
this issue with aplomb:
there is much to admire in
her reimagining.
First staged as a two-
part play at the Bristol
Old Vic in 2014, the pro-
duction spent a short spell
at the National Theatre
three years ago, toured the
country, and is now back
in London. It remains
an inventive sensory
experience that despite
its strengths sometimes
becomes too enmeshed
in its complex theatrics –
becoming a showcase of
style over substance.
Eschewing 19th
century
aesthetics, Michael Vale’s
set is a stripped down, bare
bones two-level stage has
been built around a three-
man band. The simple
stage acts as a background
to bold lighting and cho-
reography. The company
clambers up and down
iron ladders in a frenzy of
movement accompanied
by Benji Bower’s modern
folk score. Some scenes
are punctuated with song
– Melanie Marshall’s
mellifluous voice soars
above the strings. The
production would not be
half as successful without
Marshall who, it quickly
emerges, is not merely nar-
rating the story but is the
voice of the ‘mad-woman’
Bertha Mason. Cookson’s
treatment of Bertha is a
triumph: not only is she
allowed out the attic room
in which she is incarcerat-
ed in the novel and given
a voice, she is also given
one of the most memo-
rable scenes in the play.
The sequence in which
Marshall belts out a haunt-
ingly gothic rendition of
‘Mad About the Boy’ was
spine-tinglingly good.
Other dramatic flourish-
es threaten to overshadow
the substance of the play in
some parts however. In the
transitions in which Jane
travels from Gateshead
to Lowood, the company
congregates around Nadia
Clifford to form a human
coach, jogging on the
spot to mimic its journey
through the countryside.
Novel at first, by the
second time it seems
indulgent. Similarly, Paul
Mundell’s embodiment of
the dog, Pilot, is played to
great comedic effect, but
Patchy in parts, Sally Cookson’s adaptation remains a worthy staging of the much beloved novel

his enthusiastic portrayal,
complete with panting
and wagging tail, detracts
rather than adds to the
weight of some of the cru-
cial scenes between Jane
and Rochester.
Much like the novel,
the play comes into its
own at Thornfield. There,
the chemistry between
Nadia Clifford in the
eponymous role, and Tim
Delap, playing Rochester,
is electric. Clifford in par-
ticular is superb, scrappy
and rebellious as a child,
self-assured with a hidden
steeliness as a woman.
Despite excellent
performances, timing re-
mains an issue. The three
hour run-time is at once
exhausting and too short
to do the novel justice. It’s
at Lowood, the tyrannical
boarding school Jane at-
tends in her youth, that the
play seems truncated. We
have been scarcely intro-
duced to Jane’s only friend
and solace at the establish-
ment, Helen, when she
dies. We never really feel
the impact her friendship
and her subsequent death
has on Jane. Similarly,
towards the end of the
play, Jane’s time with the
Rivers feels rushed. The
hour that was cut in order
to accommodate the play
as a single performance in
its transition from Bristol
may well have smoothed
both the beginning and the
end of the production.
CharlotteBrontë’snovel
took the literary world by
storm when it was first
published in 1847, with
its strong fiery heroine and
its undercurrent of sexual
charge, it was unlike any
other novel of the time,
especially not one written
by a woman. Cookson’s
adaptation attempts to
bring that revolution to the
stage – it’s a shame that
it chooses to focus much
of its time on thrilling the
audience with dramatic
staging as it’s when the
actors are left alone to tell
the story simply is when
the production is at its
most powerful.
