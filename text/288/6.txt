SELECTING YOUR CAREER By MR. E. MEACOCK
This article will not, in
any way, answer the question
which so many young women
and men ask in their middle
to late 'teens, "What career
shall I follow?" The scope is
wide; so wide in fact that in
my allotted space it would
not be possible even to list
the opportunities open to
graduates of Imperial Col-
lege.
In one's early days, from
about five years to seven
years old, the favourite
question — "and what do
you want to be when you
grow up?" could be, and
was usually, answered em-
phatically "Jet Pilot",
''Spaceman", and even "En-
gine Driver" according to
the vogue at that particular
time. As one grew older
these childhood ambitions
dimmed until, in the majority
of cases, the mind became
perplexed by the increasing
knowledge of the world and
the activities of other men
and women.
The state of vagueness
can, and does last until the
second, and even third year
at a university. This fact is
recognised and Appoint-
ments Boards exist, not
merely to act as employ-
ment bureaux, but to advise,
guide, and to help those
students who wish to take
advantage of the facilities
available.
At Imperial College there
is a member of the academic
staff in each department who
is a member of the Sub Com-
mittee of the Appointments
Board. Any student, first,
second or third year, or post-
graduate, can consult this
departmental representative
who will give as much
advice and assistance as
possible, but before consult-
ing him the students may
wish to explore for them-
selves some of the fields
which his or her studies are
opening up for them.
There are several publica-
tions which can be of great
help to a student who re-
quires career information.
Among these, and perhaps
one of the best, is the
"Directory of Opportunities
for Graduates" which is
published by Cornmarket
Careers Centre Ltd. This
book gives information
about a large number of
firms and organisations who
have an interest in recruit-
ing graduates, and reference
to this book will answer a
lot of those questions about
the firms which the student
will ask. Another publica-
tion on similar lines is the
Classic Publications Ltd.
"Professional Careers for
Graduate Scientists and
Engineers".
These books are excellent
in giving students ideas and
information concerning com-
panies, but they still do not
supply the whole answer to
your question "What do I
want to do?"
Most of the firms who
employ graduates issue
literature describing their
organisations, and the
various opportunities open
to the graduates who join
the company. Naturally this
is recruitment literature and
biased in the firms favour-—
one would expect this, but
the literature provides part
of the information necessary
to help decide on the final
line of action.
Occasionally the course
suggested above does not
give the student the answer
and after going through the
books and brochures, and
taking his problems to the
departmental representative
that perplexity still remains
to some extent. There is yet
a further source of advice
open at the College.
The Imperial College
Appointments Board has
strong links with the Univer-
sity of London Appoint-
ments Board and we have
taken advantage of a com-
prehensive Careers Advisory
Service which the Univer-
sity Board provides. The
Service is operated by Field
Officers who are graduates
with a wide range of ex-
perience and a thorough
knowledge of most fields of
employment. A Field Officer
visits the College one day a
week during term and vaca-
tions to help students make
decisions about careers and
subsequently to help put
them in touch with suitable
employers. Students who
wish to see the Field Officer
should consult their depart-
mental representative first.
I have glibly talked of
the books and brochures but
have given no hint of how
to gain access to them. That
omission shall now be rec-
tified.
In the near future, as
soon as certain structural
details have received atten-
tion, a Publications Library
will be opened on level 3,
College Block, by the College
Appointments Board. It is
the aim of the Board to
make available to die
students all the literature
supplied by the companies
and any other literature
which has any connection
with careers. There will be
no fanfare as the room is
opened as it will be brought
into full operation as quickly
as possible.
So far I have dealt with
the student who, having
completed his course, selects
a career within his field of
study, but what of the
student who wishes to use
his degree in wider fields?
A good guide here is a pub-
lication issued by the
Careers Research and
Advisory Centre entitled
"Beyond a Degree" which
gives considerable help in
suggesting possibilities which
probably would not occur
to the student in this posi-
tion.
To such students my
advice is to consult the
above mentioned book,
which is available on appli-
cation to the Appointments
Board Office on Level 3,
College Block then discuss
possible plans with your
departmental representative
and, if he advises, the Field
Officer.

doubt in students minds as

partmental representatives a
