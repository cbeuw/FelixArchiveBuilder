Football: I.C. march on in
League, but lose Cup
I.C. looking half the team
they were, went out of the
U.L. Cup to Bedford at
Headstone Lane. Playing
against a well-drilled side,
the team showed little en-
thusiasm for the game and
although I.C. were one up
at half-time (a penalty by
Barnard), Bedford were
playing the better football
taking control of midfield.
I.C. defended well despite
heavy pressure until the
luckless Hewitt left a shot
to go wide only to see it
creep inside the post. The
forwards did nothing to take
the pressure off the defence
and Bedford found the win-
ner with a good header from
a corner. I.C. fought back
well, hitting the post, but
time ran out leaving the team
to wonder why the cup pro-
duced our worst perform-
ance of the season.
Cross
Country
Last Wednesday week I.C.
scored a narrow win over
Metropolitan Police and
Westminster Bank at Hayes
(Kent). Over a complicated
6-mile course consisting of
woodland and playing fields.
1.C. scored 34 points to the
Bank's 37. Metropolitan Po-
lice were third with 66
points. Barry Dabrowski.
Chris Burden and Eth
Himsworth all ran well to
finish first, third and fifth
respectively, with the much
improved Rog Phelps in
eleventh position.
Results:
1, I.C. 1st team, 34 points;
2, Westminster Bank 1st
team, 37 points; 3, Metro-
politan Police. 66 points;
4, Westminster Bank 2nd
team, 89 points; 5. I.C, 2nd
team. 99 points.

Open Mon. to Fri., 1
0 — 5.30
Back in the league on Sat-
urday 31st (after an easy 4-0
win over C.E.M.), I.C.
found a strong Goldsmiths'
side. Playing with all the
strength and enthusiasm that
was lacking in the cup match
of the previous week I.C.
put on a fine display to win
2-0 away from home.
In the first half the score
could easily have been
opened several times. A fine
header by Clar Wilcock was
saved and a shot from Mc-
Ardle hit the bar. It was left
to John Kelly to open the
scoring in the second half.
Set free on the left, he beat
two men and squeezed the
ball inside the near post. The
second came when Tony
Holland seized on a goal-
keeping error to score from
an angle.
The whole team ran
well, the midfield trio of Wil-
cock. Widelski and Dixon
looking very strong. This
fine win comes at the right
time, for I.C. are now at
the top of the league with
Woolwich, leaders for so
long, dropping another
point. Q.M.C. lie third with
only five matches to play.
The positions are:

Hockey: I.C. Improving
Although we were heavily
defeated in our first match
of the Season the first X I
has now recovered its equili-
brium and has played very
well in the last two matches.
Unfortunately the same can-
not be said for the second
and third teams, both of
whom have lost their mat-
ches this term. It can only
be hoped that they too will
soon find their winning
form.
I.C. 0 Burnt Ash 4
In this match the effects
of not having played hockey
for seven weeks soon be-
came apparent, and we were
easily beaten by a side which
we could have overcome on
last term's form.
I.C. 1 Epsom Gipsies 2
This was a very even con-
test against a very strong
side. L C had only 10 men
and of these, 3 came from
the second team and one
from the third team. The
whole team put up a very
spirited performance and
were unlucky to lose, the
winning goal being scored in
the last five minutes.

Netball
The first netball league
match of the term was
played on 31st January at
Westfield College. The team
expected to have a tough
match and during the first
half this proved to be the
case with the goals going

evenly to both sides.
It was realised at half
time that though the score
was only 6-5 to I.C. the
team had the edge by mak-
ing Westfield play at their
speed.
Thus at the beginning of
the second half the team
gained a convincing lead
and retained this until the
final whistle.
Final score 18-11.

Badminton
On Sunday 25th January
the Ladies Badminton
Team went to Cambridge to
play a friendly match against
Cambridge University ladies
team as the team was not up
to full strength, this was
looked on as a good day
out. The team consisted of
one beginner and external
member from C.E.M. Con-
sidering all this some of the
games were strongly contes-
ted and this is not represen-
ted in the final score of 8-1
to Cambridge.

Royal Holloway 4
L C 2, Harrow 2
I.C. were unfortunate not
to win this match since we
had territorial advantage for
the whole game. Due to su-
perior half-back play we
were able to command the
middle of the field and this
enabled the I.C. forwards to
move freely. The stopping
and hitting of the whole
team was excellent. The I.C.
goals were scored by John
Schofield and Julian Sar-
gent. It may also be noted
that one of the Harrow
goals was scored whilst most
of the I.C. team were dis-
tracted by a slight fracas be-
tween the opposition inside
left and one of the L C .
team — there was no result
from this individual contest.
I.C. 4
St. Catherine's (Camb.) 0
Again in this match the
play of T.C.'s half back line
enabled the forwards to
move freely and they capit-
alised on this. The whole
forward line played well,
but special mention must be
made of Ron Dougill on the
left wing who was playing
his first game for the first
X I . The I.C. goals were
scored by John Schofield.
Julian Sargent (2) and Suki
Mudan.
Considering that two reg-
ular members of the team
were absent (one of them
due to a strange mix-up
about a certain tie on the
previous day) this was a
most pleasing result.
Team: Colin Townsley;
Alistair Forbes, Tim Wat-
son; Mike Burtt, Julian Sar-
gent, Robin King; John
Manning, Dave Richman,
M . Bates, Mike Pratt, John
Schofield; also Suki Mudan
and Ron Dougill.
Football: Tech Cup
M i n e s 2 - R . C . S . 2
Sunday 1st February saw
the second of this season's
Tech Cup matches, when
Mines met R.C.S. Both sides
started off enthusiastically,
but due to some disorganis-
ation in the R.C.S. ranks
their goalkeeper was soon
brought into action. Indeed,
in making one save he was
injured when a Minesman
managed to cut his hand
open with his studs. How-
ever, R.C.S. recovered from
this early setback and led
1-0 at half-time thanks to a
well taken goal from Rich-
ards, who beat the Mines'
goalkeeper, with a narrow-
angled shot.
The second half was one
of see-sawing fortunes,
Mines equalising when Dix-
on scored from a disputed
penalty. This was regarded
as a harsh decision even by
some Mines players.
After this, play swung
from end to end until after
a succession of corners for
R.C.S., Darley converted one
with a header from close
range. The Mines players
were not to be discouraged
by this and being driven on
by Dixon and Widelski they
got an equalising goal about
ten minutes later, when by
a great stroke of luck a
hopeful cross from the left
wing managed to beat four
R.C.S. defenders, leaving
Moon with only the goal-
keeper to beat from ten
yards out. There was no fur-
ther scoring from either
side, and so with the match
finishing as a draw R.C.S.
are faced with the task of
beating Guilds if they are to
retain the trophy.
G u i l d s 2 - M i n e s 1
In the first game of the
Tech Cup this year, Guilds
beat Mines 2-1 in a fiercely
contested match. Guilds had
the stronger attack, but
Mines defended bravely and
intelligently. Dixon was
everywhere, breaking up
Guilds' attack and starting
swift Mines counter attacks.
Guilds were the first to
score, when Willey, through
on his own, slid the ball past
the advancing goalkeeper. A
good goal by the Mines out-
side right made the scores
equal at half time.
The second half was
scrappy with neither side
able to produce any fluent,
coherent football. Mines
presumably would have been
satisfied with a draw, but
McCardle made it 2-1 for
Guilds 15 minutes from the
end. Jumping with the goal-
keeper he managed to force
the dropping ball into goal.
Mines tried to switch the
emphasis of their game for
the last period, but now it
was Guilds turn to defend
which they did successfully.
