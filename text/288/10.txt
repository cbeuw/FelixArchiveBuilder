N
e
w Constitution for R.C.S.
The working party set up
at the last RCS Union
Meeting to re-write the
RCSU Constitution, has now
virtually completed its mam-
moth task, over a three
hour coffee-drinking session.
It is hoped the new Consti-
tution will be presented to
a Union meeting shortly.
The most important
changes proposed are to give
the Vice President something
to do, to constitutionalise the
RCS Broadsheet, the Enter-
tainments Committee, and
the Academic Affairs Com-
mittee, and to cut down the
number of Union meetings.
In the objects of the Un-
ion, the working party pro-
poses that Carnival Charity
effort should be added to the
objects, and that student
welfare be removed, as the
latter is now ably taken
care of by IC Union.
The basic reasons for these
changes are that the General
Committee has had great
difficulty in finding enough
business to do at the six sta-
tutary Union meetings each
year. Moreover, many mem-
bers of the Gen. Comm. have
been re-thinking the role of
Constituent Colleges. In
future, it is proposed that
ICU business will be strict-
ly left to ICU so that RCSU
will not weaken or duplicate
the efforts of the Central
Union.
To further this aim, they
propose to have only four or-
dinary Union meetings per
session. The first would be a
Freshers' Meeting, arranged
primarily by Ents. In the
spring term, there would be
a hustings meeting to pre-
sent the aspiring candidates
for elections, followed by a
meeting to announce and
ratify the results of these el-
ections. The last meeting
would be the AGM. In ad-
dition, an Extraordinary
Union Meeting could be cal-
led by 20 members. The
quorum for all of these
would be kept at the nomi-
nal low figure of 50.
On the subject of elec-
tions, ballots would have to
be held throughout RCS for
the posts of President, Sec-
retary, Chairman of Ents,
Academic Affairs Officer,
and Charity Carnival Organi-
ser. The latter person, would
be the former Vice President
who would be given an

actual job to do. Before, the
only official task of the VP
was to take over the chair
in the absence of the Presi-
dent. Now, it is proposed, he
would chair a Carnival Com-
mittee of year Reps, so that
he could be in more direct
touch with Union members
to persuade them to make
greater efforts to support
Carnival collections, etc.
The RCS Broadsheet is
now in the Constitution. The
Editor would, in the new
proposals, be co-opted onto
the Executive Committee
(a re-named version of the
General Committee). The
content and format of the
Broadsheet would be left to
the Editor, as yet nothing
has been decided about fin-
ancial control.
The Ents Committee and
Academic Affairs Commit-
tee would both be put on a
formal basis in the new pro-
posals. A list of functions
to be organised by Ents is
written in—this includes a
"Smoking Concert", but
nothing is said about what
goes on at this function, so
in theory (at least) we could
be seeing an H . G. Wells
type of Smoking Concert.
The Academic Affairs Offi-
cer is given a Committee of
the ICU Department Reps
and members of the Depart-
mental Sub-Committees.
The Acad. Off., who would
be Chairman, would also be
the RCSU Rep on Council,
so could easily promote the
views of RCS students on
that body. The Departmental
Sub-Committees would deal
mainly with academic mat-
ters, and they would be
chaired by the IC Depart-
ment Reps.
Also, the RCS Clubs and
Societies would come under
the control of a single Com-
mittee, the Clubs Comm.
In the Rules to be observ-
at General Meetings, the
working party wants to
acknowledge reality by
scrubbing the clause which
bans "ammunition" from the
Meeting.
A clause which could lead
to abuse would be the pro-
posal that Constitutional
Changes need only be pos-
sed by one meeting, instead
of two as before.
Most of the Officers of
RCSU are confident that
the new Constitution would,
if passed by the Union,
greatly improve the purpose
and activities of RCSU, es-
pecially in view of the cur-
rent re-thinking about the
role of Constituent Colleges
in IC Union.

Council
Give Southside
a Chance
"The standard of cooking
has improved in the last
fortnight, and must be
given a chance." So said Mr.
Stephenson at "Massive (in-
quorate) Mooney Meeting"
last week.
In fact, the low attendance
drew the waspish comment
from Mr. Stephenson that
"you arrange these things
and the nobody comes".
Mr. Stephenson, Mr. Levy,
chairman and deputy chair-
man of the Refectory Com-
mittee, and Mr. Mooney
answered questions from the
floor
Mr. Mooney saw no
necessity for such extreme
measures as a boycott but
agreed that the standard of
cuisine in Southside used
to leave something to be de-
sired.
Mr. Stephenson's opinion
was that, Southside except-
ted, the refectories had im-
proved greatly this year, the
Union especially. He too
Messrs. Stephenson, Mooney and Levy at the Union Meeting.
admitted that Southside was
poor but added that there
are now two cooks in South-
side whereas there used to be
none. The cooks were quite
upset by the boycott and felt
they had not been given a
chance to prove their worth,
one of them saying he did
not know if he was any use.
On the question of over-
crowding in the student but-
tery in College Block, Mr.
Stephenson said that when
College Block was in the de-
sign stage some years ago,
the equivalent of the but-
tery, the old "chippie" in the
Union, was underused. Con-
sequently only the present
cramped quarters had been
allocated in the design.

Balkan Workshop
held in Linstead Hall
Dave Wield, long stand-
ing member of I.C. Union,
hard worker on Council and
a contributor to Felix for
many years has been forced
to resign from Council in
order to devote more time to
his work
Over the past years Dave
has devoted much of his
time to furthering the demo-
cratisation of the Union,
playing a large part in the
upheavals of last year which
gave IC an elected for the
first time. He was on
JURGO and was one of
the student representatives
on the Merger Committee'
during the abortive discus-
sions with the Architectural
Association. He also played a
leading part in the negotia-
tions to join N.U.S., which
I.C. has been a member of
for some months now.
Unfortunately D a v e ' s
course in Chem, Eng. means
that he is technically no
longer a student, and so has
had to resign.
The "Dunav Balkan
Group" held a Balkan
Workshop in Linstead Hall
Sunday last where the 'ideal'
number of about fifty pre-
sent were taught some
Yugoslav and Greek dances
and songs and listened to the
group play music from
Yugoslavia, Romania, Turk-
ey, Bulgaria and Greece.
The group, playing in
Linstead at the request of
John Gardiner played be-
tween three and six-thirty
in the afternoon and also
gave an illustrated talk on
Balkan Folk Music.
People there enjoyed
themselves immensely learn-
ing the intricacies of these
Balkan dances and there is
a possibility that another
Sunday afternoon workshop
will be arranged in the near
future. Everyone is invited
and welcome to come along.
Queries to John Gardiner,
Linstead Hall.
