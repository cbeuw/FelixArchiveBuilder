HAPPY DEATHDAY j f t l m & E b t e t o £ f
Happy Deathday from the
play by Peter Howard and
directed by Henry Cass, is
set in the Tudor home of
Josh Swinyard, a rich but
dying man. Swinyard (Cyril
Luckham) knowing he has
only a short time to live, re-
solves to find out how his
family will treat him when
they find out he could die
at any moment. His son-in-
law Zoltan (Clement Mc-
Callin), a brilliant scientist
offers him in return for his
money to freeze his body
until such a time, when it
might be possible to reverse
the effects of old age. The
old man tells him that he
thinks he is mad and hints
that he is going to give all
his money to his grand-
daughter Jetta, who is the
only one in his family with
any hope left, the others
having denied the faith
years ago. This makes his
daughter uptight about the
whole thing and when Jetta
announces that she's preg-
nant, the whole conflict
emerges. Jetta can find no
sympathy from anyone and
not wanting to shock her
grandfather to death, decides
to commit suicide. This
brings everyone else to their
senses and Zoltan is con-
verted. Hurrah! Hurrah!
I think an interesting idea
has been ruined by the
oversimplification of treat-
ment. I thought most of the
performances were un-
convincing, but did like
that newcomer Y v o n n e
Antrobus (right) as Jetta.
The contrasts between good
and evil were made some-
what too obvious and there-
fore seemed unreal, especially
the actions of Zoltan after
finding his daughter dead.
However the message will
probably get through to the
converted, and anyrate it's
quite good for a low budget
film.
Z is still on at the Curzon
cinema and still pulling in
large audiences, which isn't
really surprising since it
was probably the best film
of last year. It tells the
fascinating story of a
political assassination (in an
unidentified Mediterranean
c o u n t r y ) (could it be
Greece?) and how a deter-
mined young examining
magistrate (Jean Louis
Trintignant) grimly digs out,
from a succession of scared
witnesses, evidence of police
corruption. The makers of
the film say that it is a true
account of Greece before the
generals took over. The film
is striking and extremely
moving. Trintignant and
Yves Montand as the politi-
cian give superb performan-
ces which bring home the
poignancy of the dilema.

Summer: about two boys
Hurrah for the Bridge"
This was originally entered for the U.L.U. one act play
on the grounds that it consisted of a load of metaphysical
rubbish laced with some tidy chunks of violence. The plot
in general consists of an old man wheeling the corpse, or
soul, of a dead prostitute to an indefinite destination by
the river. E n route he is set upon, mocked, tortured and
finally knifed by a gang of teds, who throughout the proceed-
ings dispose of two of their number into the said river. This
looks and sounds like a load of old cock!
Further inspection, however, revealed that the play should
be taken more seriously. The character of the old man is so
subtle and demanding and the imagery so vast and confused
that it tied the whole bloody cast up in knots and the only
thing left seems to be to play the old sod as a loon—which
would explain a lot of things—such as the dialogue !
The characters of the four yobs have likewise grown
complex to the point of imbecility. The main conflicts appear
to he not with the old man but in the interplay of characters
within the wolfpack which eventually results in the death of
the two weakest. Since these parts of the play consist of
(sic) improvisations, constant group therapy exercises to
'establish confidence and familiarity' have driven everyone
to the desired state of paranoia (and the damn thing goes on
to Thursday).
As a final point, if this thing does make it—it could easily
be the best and most exciting production Dramsoc has ever
spawned.

The Architectural Associa-
tion is not coming to IC and
its future is in jeopardy. As
you know, the negotiations
broke down because the col-
lege took an inflexible and
illiberal attitude to the A A ' s
participatory academic com-
munity—as it says in the
U G C pamphlet: "the college
is confirmed that—(for the
A A school at IC) . . . stu-
dent participation should fol-
low the general pattern for
the college as a whole."
The potential academic
gain (of Prof. Buchanan,
Guardian) and the views of
ICU were ignored; the col-
lege seems to take the atti-
tude that academic fredom
is freedom to conform—or
else! So we hold a morator-
ium.
The week before last when
the ICRC (students and tech-
nicians/, etc.) discussed the
refectory situation. They de-
cided to seek an urgent meet-
ing with the rector—of a
delegation representing every
section of the college com-
munity.
The rector refused, writing
back that the I C R C "has no
constitutional position in
IC". So what! If representa-
tives of the vast majority of
the college want to organise
themselves to discuss things
of mutual interest with the
head of the college why
shouldn't they? Anyhow, de-
spite this, at the food forum
U G M , the Union produced a
set of minimal requests,
which the college's refectory
committee should have pro-
duced ages ago. If a favour-
able decision is not forth-
coming, by the U G M on
Feb. 19th, direct action will
certainly be considered.
The senior common room
committee, after discussion
with the rector, organised a
referendum about our re-
quests, but they did not pre-
sent the Union case to mem-
bers of the SCR and only
asked one emotive Y E S / N O
question. The result was, of
course, no. But anyway, what
about such propositions as:
"make PGs members of the
SCR" or "make College
Block a free precinct".
A l l these things show that
Imperial College seems to be
arrogant and inflexible, in-
capable of understanding
other ideas or recognising
the validity of different con-
cepts of academic organisa-
tion.
Pedestrian discussion is
occurring on diversification
—but the Open Forum on
the subject has not yet been
held—because too much con-
troversy was expected!
We are waiting for a deci-
sion on representation from
the BOST on February 18th
to be reported to the Feb.
19th U G M .
