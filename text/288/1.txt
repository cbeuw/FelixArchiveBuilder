After eight years of nego-
tiations towards the merger
of the Architectural Asso-
ciation with Imperial Col-
lege, the Governors of I.C.
called off the talks last week.
Lord Penney, writing to
John Dennys, the acting
President of the Architectural
Association said that "the
Association has raised funda-
mental issues, and events
have taken place in the
course of the negotiations
which have finally caused my
colleagues and I to realise
that the requisites for a suc-
successful merger do not
exist'.
The decision to call off the
negotiations left the Archi-
tectural Association stunned
and many students at I.C.
and the A.A. dissatisfied.
The I.C. governors raised
three issues in particular in
coming to their decision. On
the actual fusion of the A.A.
within a composite College
of Science and Technology,
Lord Penney wrote that the
A.A. desired the fusion "only
on their own terms'.
Participation
Of more relevance to
Imperial College students,
the Governors had this to
say on the much greater level
of student participation at
the A.A. "The stress laid on
the participation of architect-
ural students in negotiations
about the terms and condi-
tions of appointment of aca-
demic architectural staff, and
also in examination process-
es raises matters, which, as
we have said, are wholly un-
acceptable to Imperial Col-
lege.
("Unlike life tenures at
I.C, the A.A. only appoints
staff for up to five years, in
the belief that this keeps
teachers up to date.")
Thirdly, Lord Penney and
his colleagues were not con-
fident that "even if the Asso-
ciation accepted the Imper-
ial College position, this ac-
ceptance would be endorsed
and fulfilled by the School
and 'community' following a
merger".
Reply
Recovering their compos-
ure, Mr. Dennys replied on
behalf of the A.A., that the
"A.A. did not agree that a
basis for a merger no longer
existed". This comment came
at the end of a chilly letter
to Lord Penney in which Mr.
Dennys expressed amaze-
ment that "such a distin-
guished body should have
behaved so irresponsibly".
No members of the Asso-
ciation were present at the
Governors meeting which de-
cided to drop the A.A., even
though three Imperial Col-
lege students were there. In-
deed, the I.C. governors had
permitted working party
meetings and discussions
right up to this particular
meeting and had even ar-
ranged future dates. This the
A.A. found "hard to believe,
without giving us some clear
indication of what was in
your (Lord Penney's) mind."
Fund raising
The move was taken at a
time when the President of
the Association, Miss Jane
Drew, was in the U.S.A. try-
ing to raise money for the
new buildings needed by the
A.A. on the I.C. campus.
Until last week's decision,
the A.A. was running a com-
petition for these new build-
ings, and had only just com-
mitted themselves to several
thousand pounds additional
expenditure in announcing
the second stage of the com-
petition.
Moreover, the A.A. felt
that the Governors' decision,
and their letter, lid not "ex-
press one word of regret for,
nor shown any understanding
of, the possible results on
their action in setting at haz-
ard the education and future
careers of the students and
staff of the school."

A number of readers have
said that they thought that
the pictures of cockroaches
in the last issue of FELIX
were not genuine. In fact
they were photos of cock-
roaches caught by the in-
trepid FELIX staff big game
hunter during a safari to die
Southside kitchens.
They were both photo-
graphed (deceased, he's not
that intrepid) in a Southside
room and they are/were
called Batella Germanica.
Shortly after the FELIX-
PROBE safari to lower
Mooney a few weeks ago, our
intrepid entymologist suffer-
ed a psychological break-
down, so FELIX is now un-
informed as to the state of
the kitchens or the cooking
in Lower Southside. Thus
we would be interested to
hear from readers on the
culinary situation.
The Architectural Association in Bedford Square, whose
existence is now threatened by I.C's. decision.

Last Friday evening I.C.
entered a team of three for
carnival in the G.P.O. Tower
Race. What's more Norman
Morrison of Maths III won,
knocking twenty-five seconds
off the previous record in the
attempt, to finish the cork-
screw run of eight hundred
steps in four minutes, twenty
one seconds.
This is a year of endur-
ance tests for Carnival Char-
ity. Help is still needed for
those competing in the "Five
Capitals Hitch-Hike' race
next weekend. All you have
to do is buy a ticket to guess
the time the winner takes to
complete the course. The
nearest three guesses will win
prizes totalling eighteen per
cent of the takings. Tickets
are obtainable from year
reps, and carnival office.
Pywell
resigns
Barry Pywell has resigned
as RCS Vice-President in
disgust at the Union's atti-
tude to Carnival Charity
collections. His resignation
was announced at last week's
RCSU meeting.
Close friends of this beard-
ed stalwart of Physics 3
point out that Barry has
been virtually the sole sup-
porter of Carnival in RCSU.
The year rep system appears
to have broken down com-
pletely; many year reps have
done nothing to arrange col-
lections, etc., the same can be
said of the Department Reps,
who are in overall charge of
the Carnival effort in their
Dept. Barry is reported to be
disgusted at their lack of
effort.
Nevertheless, despite his
protest resignation, Barry
will continue to support Car-
nival, and will act as un-
official RCSU Carnival Or-
ganiser for the rest of this
term. He hopes to drag the
Union out of its present state
of apathy, which has resulted
in under six people turning
up at recent collections!
