The AA-IC merger finally makes headline news in the
only way that ever seemed likely—by breaking up. Blame
who you like, believe whom you want, the whole thing
finally reached an impasse and folded up, and the future
for tike Architectural Association looks black.
It looks blacker for I.C., if the sea of apathy which greeted
the news of the breakdown is any indication. Out of almost
4,000 students some 300 turned up to the last Union meeting;
when the subject of the merger was raised a third of them
drifted away, the meeting was declared inquorate, and the
president was left on his own addressing an ever dwindling
flock of the faithful.
Attempted communication between the makers of Union
Policy and the general Union member has been better this
year, mainly through Piers' bumph-sheet mania, but it has
not been enough to shake IC's student body into taking a
major interest in the policies of Council and the conflict
between the Union and the Administration. It's not difficult
to see why: Quinquennium reports and participation, repre-
sentation (you know the rest) sound as tedious as Council
meetings, and something more has to be done than merely
tell a student how important they are.
We have one publicity officer, who has enough to do
making posters; instead of all this hastily scrawled dupli-
cated info, let there be a separate student group in charge
of producing some reasonably attractive advertising for the
Union, in the Union.
In reply
Dear Sir,
In reply to Paris, we feel (as 3 honourable members of
I.C.W.A.) that A P P L E R O T is also attacking the males at
I.C. They are slowly being chewed up by work, disinterest
of the opposite sex, chronic alcoholism, rugby or SHY-
NESS???!!! (or so we are told).
What happened to the honourable decent, well meaning
men that are supposed to make up the top 1\ per cent of the
country's population.
If this is them then L O N G L I V E D U S T M E N , N A V V I E S ,
D O C K Y A R D I E S and I.C. maintenance M E N .
Yours (NEVER!!!)
(you should be so lucky)

Dear U.C.,
A few people have asked
me 'How was the timing of
the refectory boycott on
Tuesday 20 January decided
on?'. The answer is, frankly,
quite unimportant but since
' F E L I X ' is interested I will
explain. Following the boy-
cott decision of the 15 Janu-
ary U.G.M., the special
I.C.U. Council meeting (of
Monday 19 January) decided
that: (i) I—in consultation
with John Goodman and
other pickets—would decide
at 11.30 on each day, on
which there could possibly be
a boycott, whether or not to
boycott on that day. (ii)
Pickets were to come to the
Union Office at 11.30 every
such day, beginning with
Tuesday. The decision was
to be taken in this way to
ensure that the boycott was
a surprise. Anybody who at-
tended the special Council
Mental Blockages
Dear Sir,
It is becoming apparent that in its efforts to remain independent of all pressure -groups
in the Union, F E L I X is become a private arena for political abuse of left by right and
vice versa. While not deprecating this useful function, it deserves to be kept within bounds.
I suggest therefore, that extremists be severely limited to two pages, and that these are
printed on opposite sides of the same single sheet, and prominently labelled. The large
numbers of people who are uninspired and bored by the regular evidence of the mental
blockages of Muller, Lafferty, X , Robinson, et al, may then, instead of having to skirt
their illogical rubbish, remove it neatly and discard it before reading the paper.
It may be objected that this will cost money : this could well be covered by appropriate
contributions (on the advertising scale) from the above mentioned persons, as they ob-
viously consider their views worthy of the at tention of the masses.
A n alternative would be to add two subroutines to the 7094 library : ' L E F T ' and
'RIGHT'. Anyone addicted to the regular reassurance of views he agrees with has only to
include these in a programme to receive two pages of random prose in the relevant style,
totally indistinguishable from the originals.
Yours sincerely,
P.LEE,P3
meeting (unlike F E L I X )
would know this. On Tues-
day at 11.30 I was phoned
up (in my Southside room) by
John Butterworth who was
in the Union Office with
some other pickets. After a
discussionwe agreed ona boy-
cott that day, John Goodman
should have been there and
wasn't—but he doesn't mind!
A larger number of people,
than Who have asked me
about the boycott timing,
have asked me about the fol-
lowing (for instance): What
can we do about possible
education cuts? What does
the Rector think about the
A A ? What shall we do if the
BOST say 'no' again? What
did Gerry Fowler (of DES)
say to me? What (in sum-
mary) are the recommenda-
tions of the Quinquenium
Working Party? I think the
answers to these questions
are important but will not
attempt to give them here
'because of space reasons'.
Yours, etc.,
PIERS CORBYN
(I.C.U. President)
Third World
Dear Sir,
As I watch with interest
the growing concern at Im-
perial College over the eco-
nomic, social and political
struggle in the Third World,
and at the same time notice
the vast human resources, at
the College, of students in
science and technology, in-
cluding a large proportion of
students from the Third
World, may I make use of
the pages of your newspaper
to stir up interest in the for-
mation, at the College, of
study groups in Third World
technology policies and tech-
nical requirements.
We have heard of the
'Science of Science' study
groups involved in the scien-
tific investigation of the in-
fluence, effect and correct
application of science poli-
cies. As regards developing
societies, these investigations
are very urgently needed for
obvious reasons. Here the
greatest interest lies both
with science policies and with
technology policies. What is
more, some very hard and
basic work must be done,
since what is applicable to
Britain and other advanced
societies will not necessarily
work well with other types
of societies.
Imperial College prides it-
self in its contribution to the
technological education in
developing countries, its ex-
change with the Indian Insti-
tute of Technology at Delhi
being one of the most quoted
examples. It has also a high
proportion of students from
these countries, especially re-
search students. Nevertheless
it cannot help in the fact
that its curricula, its subjects
of study, syllabuses and re-
search interests of its staff
are almost wholly geared to
the requirements of highly
industrialised and technologi-
cally advanced countries like
Britain. Those who claim
that one science and engin-
eering syllabus meets the re-
quirements of every society
are surely trying to mislead.
It is only through study, in-
vestigation and learning from
others that the College can
Anagrams and
Hot Air
Dear Sir,
I was more than a little
surprised when 1 read M r .
Hains' letter in your last
issue, in which he positively
affirms that his latest open
letter on diversification is
vitally important and much
more deserving of type-
find out how to meet the re-
quirements of developing
countries, since there is little
experience at present to go
by. It is the students from
these developing countries
who have to find out and
look after their own interest,
and initially they have to do
it themselves. The College's
Board of Studies should
make its own contribution to
this, in forming and financing
a unit for such studies, per-
haps to ease the guilty con-
science felt after the govern-
ment's advice on increased
fees for overseas students.
Yours faithfully,
JOHN CHEUNG,
The letter has been con-

space than other articles of a
more diverse nature. If we
must accept that a student
newspaper only exists for
members of staff to read, it
is difficult to see how yet an-
other open letter on diversi-
fication can forward its
cause.
I had always imagined, ob-
viously mistakenly that F E L -
I X was produced for the stu-
dents of I.C. whose discern-
ing minds could see that
'open letters on diversifica-
tion' were a form of anagram
where the sentiments could
be shuffled and reshuffled
and presented as original
issue after issue. As I now
know, F E L I X is produced
solely for the benefit of staff
and council, who 'apparently'
are not so discerning about
what they read. I will not
fritter sixpences on F E L L X
any more as it is obviously
not intended for a mere stu-
dent who expects more than
hot air from a newspaper.
Yours faithfully,
JUSTIN G. JOHNSON
