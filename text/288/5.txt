How To Lose Money Without Really Dying
In this article, Insurance Broker Derek Cummings whojs delivering next week's General studies lecture on
the subject of insurance, is questioned on the subject by Felix
Q: The title of your lec-
ture is "How to lose money
without really dying"—what
does this mean?
A: It means this. Insurance
companies sell endowment
policies to the majority of
their policyholders. These
policies very skilfully en-
tangle the two factors con-
cerning insurance — the pro-
tection factor and the savings
factor. And the point is that.
When it comes to providing
for your dependants in the
event of your death, insur-
ance companies are ex-
tremely good. But if you live
— if your policy becomes an
investment against later life
or retirement — then they
are diabolically uncom-
petitive.
Q: You have gone on
record as saying that all in-
surance companies are
rogues—why?
A: In fact, you are referr-
ing to the title of my last
lecture. I said it then and I
will go on repeating it
because insurance companies
mislead the public into
believing that ^endowment-
type policies are the best
things for the public, when
in fact they are merely the
best for the insurance com-
panies.
Q: If this is true, why have
the companies been so suc-
cessful in what you have
called misleading the public?
A: Because insurance is an
emotional business. Every-
one needs insurance. But the
insurance companies spend
fortunes on advertising and
promoting only those kinds
of policies which are most
profitable to them.
Q: You have said that
taking the investment factor,
insurance companies give the
public a bad deal. Why?
A: Because the best of
them — the very best of
them — take eighteen years
to double your money —
whereas the economy has
taken only fifteen years to
halve the real value of your
money. Obviously, the in-
surance companies are on
the best end of the deal by
miles.
Q: How do you back up
this argument?
A: I can back it with two
references. According to
"The Economist" of April
26, 1969, the top six in-
surance companies will, on
average, take twenty years
to double your money. On
the other hand, the Central
Statistical Office of the
Treasury, in a statistic dated
September 19, 1969, categori-
cally states that the pound
has halved its real value in
fifteen years.
Q: Therefore it would
seem that contemplating any
type of insurance is a waste
of time and a potential
waste of money?
A : As long as the in-
dividual has no financial
responsibilities, yes, I agree.
But it is my opinion that
young people should not
ignore the value of saving
vigorously towards an end,
which is not necessarily re-
tirement, but which is going
to have a far more important
immediate bearing on their
lives. For example, house
purchase. As for life assur-
ance, it's fine — when there
is a need for protection.
Q: Assuming the need to
look to the future, what
form should saving or in-
vestment take?
A: Put your money into a
building society. Y o u are
going to need a mortgage
before you die! Look at it
this. way. Insurance com-
panies take your valuable
pounds today and your
gradually less valuable
pounds over a period of, say,
fifteen years, and repay you
with inevitably devalued
pounds at the end of the
period. On the other hand,
with house purchase you re-
verse this process. Y o u
borrow somebody else's
valuable pounds today to
buy an appreciating com-
modity, i.e. a house. At the
same time, you repay the
valuable pounds you have
borrowed over a period,
with devaluing money. Fur-
ther more, the appreciating
value of the commodity you
have bought is more than
enough to offset the interest
you have to pay on the
borrowed money.
Q: But there is the protec-
tion factor. I have my house,
I want to protect my family.
What advice would you give
with regard to that?
A: Spend as little as
possible to achieve the
maximum amount of cover.
It can be done cheaply. I
know it can. Every insur-
ance company in the land
knows it can, but there is a
world of difference between
their knowing it and telling
you about it. Why should
they? They're on too good
a thing with the traditional
old endowment policy. No,
they won't tell you and
neither, by the way, will
most brokers.
Q: It seems you are con-
demning your own pro-
fession.
A : Right, I am. Insurance
companies, I accept. will be
biased. Insurance Brokers,
on the other hand, are meant
to be unbiased, but I have
yet to meet any that are.
Q: Why do you say that?
A : Because it is true. It is
in the interest of brokers to
sell you the same policies as
the insurance companies
want you to buy, because
their commission is a per-
centage of the premium you
pay. The more you pay, the
more they get. Is a broker
going to tell you to buy a
policy with a cheaper pre-
mium? No, of course not.
And that is really back to
the beginning. Y o u are being
misled.
Q: Your previous answers
appear to be a strong con-
demnation of insurance com-
panies. How do you justify
being in the profession?
A: I think this is a good
question. There is, of course,
a great deal more to it than
the foregoing as you must
realise. I am hoping that
what I have said will cause
the student to scratch his
head rather more vigorously
before he leaps out to buy
insurance hand over fist. I
can, of course, answer any
questions at the General
Studies lectures on the 17th
and 24th February.
This could make all the difference
to your next twenty years
( o r y o u r s t a r t e r f o r five)
• In a few months you'll have a degree.
• You won't be ostentatious about it. Just so long as
people know.
• What matters is putting all that knowledge to
practical use.
• If each day doesn't bring new problems you won't
be interested.
• The trouble with industry is that it's still too slow
exploiting innovation.
• Yes-men go far. The further the better.
• Money matters. But what about intangibles - like keeping
your identity, not getting swallowed up?
• People matter. Especially those who will be working
with you - and those who will work for you.
• Having got this far you owe it to yourself to see the
BICC careers people.
They're here on February 26/27.
Your future's in the balance - or at least the
next five years are.
Your Appointments Officer will have details.
