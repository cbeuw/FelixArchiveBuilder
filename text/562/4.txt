By J. Passmore
W E L L D O N E , you got through
the first week as well. M y first
duty this week is to explain the
w h o l e s t r u c t u r e r e l a t i n g to
U G M s , representation, etc. So . .
UGMs
IC Union General Meetings are
held about once a month. They
d i s c u s s m a t t e r s w h i c h h a v e
arisen in the intervening period
and decide what should be done,
i.e. they instruct myself and the
other officers what to do. This
can be anything from represen-
tation within College to matters
external (normally those which
affect us).
U G M s a r e h e l d e i t h e r o n
Tuesday or Thursday lunchtimes
(1:30pm to 2:30pm) so nobody
will miss lectures. They are well
advertised beforehand. A thing
called Exec Neius is produced
three to four days before the
meeting and it contains Officers'
reports and motions which are to
be discussed.
What happens at a UGM?
W e l l , the m i n u t e s of the last
meeting are distributed at the
meeting and any matters arising
are dealt with. Then the Officers
present their reports, and everyone
asks questions about what we
have done. Then the juicy bit,
motions, where the Union formu-
lates policy to guide the Exec in
m a k i n g t h e i r d e c i s i o n s . T h e
Union policy document is kept
in the Union Office and contains
policy past back beyond 1968.
Anyone can propose any motion
at a U G M . N o r m a l l y motions
consist of noting various facts;
b e l i e v i n g s e v e r a l t h i n g s , a n d
instructing people to do things.
M o t i o n s are p r o p o s e d a n d
s p e e c h e s are m a d e , then the
m o t i o n s may be a m e n d e d or
opposed or both. A n amendment
adds s o m e e x t r a bits a n d / o r
t a k e s away s o m e bits a n d is
proposed in a similar fashion to
the main motion, it can then be
opposed. If necessary, another
round of speeches may be held
and after discussion a vote is
taken. The main motion can also
be opposed and there can also
be more speeches, finally leading
to a vote. The whole process is
complicated but it all follows the
same pattern. The only way you
can really find out is to go, and
when there, if you do not under-
stand, shout and scream at the
people at the front until they tell
you.
For meetings to remain quorate
300 people are required. That
d o e s not m e a n that just 300
should turn up. If Union meetings
are to be effective lots more are
needed.
Also many people think that
student unions are a crowd of
politicos. W e l l , we are not in
N U S and believe in representing
our own students; just look at
the agenda, basically a motion to
restrict a discussion on a subject
to once a t e r m , a m o t i o n on
lecture training (enough said) and
a motion on overseas students.
The next meeting is T U E S D A Y ,
O C T O B E R 28 at 1:00pm in the
Great Hall.
Timetables
R e m e m b e r t h a t no l e c t u r e s
should be timetabled for Wed-
nesday afternoons or the 1:30-2:30
slot on Tuesdays and Thursdays
(except for the last term). Any
complaints regarding this — see
either your Dep Rep or myself.
Y o u should know by now who
your Dep Rep is and should elect
Academic and Social reps this
week.
Papers
P a p e r s are up in the L o w e r
Lounge for a multitude of posts,
most of which no one will know
anything about. To explain:
The External Affairs Officer
deals with U L U , grants, overseas
students, libraries a n d various
other things. His/her committee
helps the officer.
The Permanent Working Party
w o r k s on matters referred to
them by Council, normally of an
internal nature, e.g. refectories.
U L U Student Representative
Council delegates represent I C U
within the University on many
academic and university matters.
Union Finance Committee
deals with Union finance (which is
approximately £189.00).
Academic Affairs Committee
d e a l s w i t h l e c t u r e r t r a i n i n g ,
tutorials, labwork, etc.
T i d d l y w i n k s was absolutely
e x c e l l e n t . W e l l d o n e all w h o
went, I hope you keep it up.
All for now. Hie! Try Bluebell
on 2488, wonderful!

President
Matters Raised
W E L L I hope you're all settled in
by now, despite the hectic first
w e e k . If y o u d i d n ' t c o m e to
Freshers' Fair then ya, boo and
sucks because you missed all the
clubs. However, you can always
get names of club captains, etc,
from Annie in the Union Office,
so you can still join up. I was
very pleased with the way the
Fair went, and I must thank Rich
Archer, Dave Britton and Annie,
who were the only ones who
stayed till the end to clear up.
A n d now the rest of this weeks
Trophy Lead
Despite what was said in the
Freshers' F E L I X , the police have
been m a k i n g progress on the
s t o l e n t r o p h i e s . T h e y h a v e
i d e n t i f i e d a s u s p e c t , w h o left
many fingerprints on the broken
w i n d o w a n d the cabinet itself,
and they are at present tracing
him so that he can "help them
with their enquiries".
JCR Furniture
Most of the furniture has now
c o m e back, completely re-up-
holstered and looking very nice
indeed. As this was achieved at a
cost of over £4,000 to the Union,
we would like to see it staying
nice. Please, please, P L E A S E
spare a little thought, and treat it
with respect, after all, its your
money, which could have been
spent in far better ways. Also I'd
like to give an official warning: if
anyone is caught abusing the
furniture they will be severely
disciplined and made to pay the
cost of making good any damage.
Finance
The Union Finance Committee
Major Claims meeting will be on
Tuesday, November 4, and all
claims must be in to me one week
b e f o r e h a n d , i.e. by T u e s d a y ,
October 28. S o all you clubs and
societies had better start thinking
about what you need and finding
some very good reasons why you
need it!
That's all for this week, so bye
for now.
