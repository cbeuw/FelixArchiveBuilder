L A S T W E D N E S D A Y , R i c h a r d
Holme, President of the Liberal
P a r t y s p o k e to the freshers*
m e e t i n g of I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
L i b e r a l C l u b . H e stressed the
fact that the Liberal Party had its
greatest opportunity in recent
years with a harsh and unpopular
T o r y government faced by an
ineffective and bickering Labour
opposition, and forecast a break-
through in the next few years, as
Liberal policies on human rights,
ecology, industrial partnership,
and 'power to the people', were
seen as relevant to the situation
of Britain and the world. During
avid discussion afterwards it was
felt that, whilst the Liberal party
should emphasise its role as the
p r o g r e s s i v e a l t e r n a t i v e , we
should be prepared to work with
b r o a d - b a s e d a n d single issue
groups to achieve our ends, and
not take the chauvinistic attitude
of the other parties insisiting we
were the 'only way'.
Imperial College Liberal Club
is part of the London Union of
Liberal Students, which will be
holding its first meeting at the
Collegiate Threatre, University
College, Gordon Street, W C l at
7:00pm on Wednesday, October
15, a n d will be a d d r e s s e d by

' L i b e r a l a l t e r n a t i v e ' . F u t u r e
events include a theatre trip,
disco, and the Union of Liberal
Students Conference at Leeds,
as well as the usual r o u n d of
campaigning. So come along and
join the most active progressive
student movement around. Keep
your eyes peeled to What's On
in F E L I X , or better still, drop us
a line in the Union Office and
join IC Liberal Club.
Red Cross
T H E M E M B E R S g r o u p of the
R e d C r o s s at IC was formed
slightly more than a year ago to
complement the activities of the
Red Cross Detachment.
Our members are involved in a
variety of activities; frequently we
are called on to send one or two
members to escort an elderly or
infirm person on a necessary
journey, perhaps from home to
hospital in London; we receive a
couple of requests a t e r m for
detective work, tracing a person
last known in this area on behalf
of their family overseas; some-
times we are called on to assist
at the local Red Cross Fair in
November (on the bar!) and at a
Christmas Party for local elderly
and disabled in December.
In addition we are in touch
with a local geriatric and psychi-
a t r i c h o s p i t a l w h e r e s e v e r a l
p e o p l e h a v e b e e n r e g u l a r l y
visiting and where we gave a very
successful concert at the end of
the Easter term.
In the next few weeks we plan
the following events:
Monday, October 13: N u r s i n g
c o u r s e b e g i n s in the H e a l t h
Centre at 6:00pm.
Wednesday, October 18: Visit
to St Mary Abbots Hospital for
coffee and talk on opportunities
for volunteers at 2:00pm.

Aid course begins at 5:45pm.

H y d e P a r k w i t h l o c a l O A P s

short concert (tour?) at a local
hospital.

interest please contact S i m o n

Folk
Imperial College Folk C l u b will
almost certainly cease to function
after the Christmas Ceilidh, i.e.
we are going to fold unless a
miracle o c c u r s and there is a
dramatic increase in membership
and audience.
However, the few who have
joined will be able to get their
money's worth by attending the
following guest nights:
Oct 20: Sam and Anne
N o v 3: C e i l i d h (probably with
Muckram Wakes)
Nov 17: Bob Pegg
Dec 8: Christmas Ceilidh with
Fiddle Bridge.

Have You Been Abroad?
Do You Come From Abroad?
IF SO YOU MUST HAVE SOME FOREIGN CHANGE
Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Bucks has the only spinal injury unit in the
South of England and the largest unit in the country.
At the moment it is in danger of closing down because of delapidation,
the hospital needs at least £1,000,000.
No we don't want money — Well, not exactly.
If you have any foreign change, any denomination, any amount, please
bring it to Annie in the IC Union Office.
Every cent, peseta, yen, will be gratefully received.

of community work, as the name
s u g g e s t s , a few of w h i c h we
would like to outline.

person and helping them, either

Soup Runs

chen. A mini van takes soup,
bread and biscuits to a few of the

L o n d o n . The soup run needs
three types of people: Drivers,
who have to be over 21, have
a clean licence for 18 months and
take a relatively simple driving
test o r g a n i s e d by the u n i o n ;
people to make soup; people to
turn up and help distribute soup,
bread and biscuits.

make the Holly Street Adventure
Playground. The first visit this
year will leave from Beit Archway

We do organise other things,
s u c h as v i s i t i n g p e o p l e in St
Mary Abbots and St Stephens
Hospitals and recruiting helpers
for the hospital for sick children
at Great Ormond Street.

this, either turn up or get in
