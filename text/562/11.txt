Last Friday, I was sent a letter by the Union
Executive, claiming certain factual inaccuracies
in last week's FELIX. Before I continue, here is
the letter:
Dear Sir,
Just a wee note to clear up a few factual
inaccuracies in your FELIX of October 3, 1980.
1. Exec News was not distributed in a frenzy at
the Rector's Reception. The copies were placed in
each department as per usual.
2. A meeting is not inquorate until the quorum
is challenged and a quorum call cannot be
withdrawn.
3. The Union Bar remained open until 5:00pm
at Freshers' Fair.
4. Miss Ruth Hildebrand's jacket was stolen
from the Guilds Reception held in the Union
Concert Hail, not from the proceedings in the
Great Hall.
5. The two gentlemen who inspected the
trophy cabinet and the Rape Alarm system around
the Union Office were from the firm who are to
install further alarms. The degree of security was
decided at the beginning of August when it was
agreed to install an alarm on the trophy cabinet at a
cost of £101, and two additional rape alarms in the
Union Office at a cost of £170.
6. The Freshers' UGM, October 7, 1976 was
closed due to inquoracy at 2:30pm. The Freshers'
U G M , October 5, 1978, was closed due to
inquoracy at 2:20pm.
7. Bill Robertson has not yet received his
Honorary Life Membership of IC Union as he was
unable to attend the Freshers' UGM, but the
presentation is scheduled for the UGM October
28, 1980.
We could go on, but that's enough for the time
being.
We fee"l it will be a great pity if this trend is
allowed to continue as there is a great risk that the
Letters Page will be reduced to corrections of
mistakes made in the previous week's issue.
Love
Michael John

themselves as an efficient, vibrant Exec, as I
received a further two mysterious phone calls
from Mr Passmore (Irishman) urging me to
print their letter.
Mr Passmore (Irishman) then picked fault
with the headline 'Freshers' U G M Inquorate'
claiming there is no such word as inquorate. Of
course, we were merely quoting Mr Passmore
(Irishman) at the U G M — see (2) of the Exec's
letter, and the part of Passmore's Preversions
where he uses the word 'quorate'.
What about the actual letter? 1-4 are mere
, trivial crap intended to fill out the letter. As for
(5), I would ask why Rae Snee did not inform
me of these details when I asked her at the end
of August for the P G Issue. Also, I distinctly
remember Mr Passmore negotiating a shady
deal (cash in hand) with a security guard who
knew the right people for 'very cheap' alarm
systems. Whatever came of that John, I don't
see you reporting it in your articles each week.
Slapped wrists all round!
What about (6)? Here I fall down, what I had
meant to write was that this is the first Freshers'
U G M for five years to be inquorate RIGHT
F R O M T H E VERY BEGINNING A T 1:00pm. I
notice the quoted UGMs had a good one and a
half hours of business discussed. And (7) —
trivial pooh.
I fear that if the trend of spending many
working hours devising methods of getting at
the Editor of FELIX is not averted then the
present nine to five Exec will degenerate into a
'What time does the bar open Exec'.
As for Mr Passmore, may I advise him that his
year as President will be judged on the amount
of policy passed at UGMs and the improve-
ments in College life made, N O T on how many
times he is seen arseholed in the Union Bar.

An apology
I would wish to retract all of the above
statements; after they were pasted down I
realised that I had been a little harsh on the
Exec. So, John, Rae and Liz, please consider all
of the above well and truly retracted.
The Exec must be very proud of their letter
as I have heard nothing else since. Rae Snee
informed IC Radio of the letter and it became a
major news item. Midweek, the Exec got the
impression that I wasn't going to print their
missive and they descended on me in force to
attempt to grill me about it.
1
I must have not satisfied their desire for
publicity for their cause, i.e. that portraying
Thanks to
All those people who helped this week, I won't
list you as I don't know some of your names.
Please come to the staff meeting at 1:00pm
today and introduce yourself in a more relaxed
atmosphere. And don't forget the Phoenix
meeting on Tuesday at 7:00pm in Stans.

fundamental questions about the very safety
of the mosque, and of the equipment of
IC Radio. It is startling that Dave Fuller was
only informed of the decision to site
a mosque at 9 P r i n c e s G a r d e n s last
Thursday after the decision was finalised.
U is indeed woeful that the Estates Office
saw fit to go ahead without even cursory
consultation. Though it is clear that Islam
Soc have a case for a mosque, is this the
best site available? Unfortunately due to
the non-appearance of Islam Soc in the
Union Handbook or its officers in the Union
Directory, FELIX has been unable to discuss
with them their point of view.

that according to the crime book, the
fingerprint search had drawn negative
results. This was signed by Detective
Constable Zellmer, the officer in charge of
the case. Unfortunately, D C Zellmer was
