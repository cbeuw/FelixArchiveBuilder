Tragic death of Professor Ruddock
KELLY ROBINSON
Imperial College's Physics
Department mourns the sad loss of
Professor Keith Ruddock, a highly-
valued member of staff, killed in a
road traffic accident on December
18th.
Professor Ruddock was born in a
small mining village in South Wales.
His exceptional mathematical ability
rapidly earned him recognition at
West Monmouth Grammar School,
and secured him a place at IC to
study Physics in 1957. It was here
that he was to spend the rest of his
academic career. The young Keith
Ruddock developed an interest in
optics. Under the influence of
Professor David Wright, a leading
optical physicist, he soon became
influential in his chosen area of
research, the study of vision in
humans.
His success in improving our
understanding of normal vision led to
his study of abnormalities of vision
in patients who had suffered brain
damage as a result of stroke or
tumour. His aim was not only to
stretch the frontiers of medical sci-
ence but also to help the many indi-
vidual patients involved in his pro-
ject. Ruddock was a true humanitari-
an, regularly travelling across the
country to visit patients who were
unable to come to London, carrying
portable equipment specially
designed by him. Several of his
patients, some of whom knew him
for nearly twenty years, became per-
sonal friends of the Professor.
He was awarded a Royal Society
Exchange Fellowship to work in
Venezuela with Gunnar Svaetichin, a
leading researcher into single-cell
electro-physiological recording. On
his return to IC, Professor Ruddock
was able to use the knowledge he had
gained to establish a research pro-
gramme at Silwood Park, where he
recorded from within cells in the reti-
na.
Always finding his research led
him into controversial ground
Ruddock always showed great diplo-
macy, maintaining his stance yet at
the same time respecting the views of
others.
Not only was he a dedicated
researcher, the Professor was also
highly committed to teaching. He
was a charismatic lecturer who
instilled a deep enthusiasm for bio-
physics in his students, often compet-
ing to carry out final-year projects or
PhD's with him. "Keith really
engaged students during his passion-
ate lectures on Biophysics, in fact I
would say he was one of the best lec-
turers in the whole department" one
of his students remarked.
In 1988 he became Professor of
Biophysics and in 1991 was appoint-
ed Head of the Biophysics group in
the Physics Department.
Ruddock greatly enjoyed visiting
former students all over the world
and also made frequent trips abroad
to lecture. It was this love of foreign
travel which fueled his passion for
languages - most notably Chinese.
In addition to his work for the
College, Keith Ruddock was on sev-
eral editorial boards and national
committees. He found his work for
the Vision Research Working Party
of the Welcome Trust particularly
enjoyable. In 1985 he became one of
the four founding members of the
Neuro-opthalmology Club, the con-
tinuing success of which can be
attributed to his relentless enthusi-
asm.
Ruddock was not just a brilliant
scientist but a man who lived life to
the full, cramming a lot into his 58
years. He took a keen interest in
rugby and cricket and loved the

opera.
His political beliefs, formed in the
Welsh valleys of his youth inspired a
life-long commitment to socialism,
led to his marriage in 1963 to Joan
Anthony, now a Labour MP. They
had known each other as teenagers
and she followed him to IC. They
spent thirty happy years together but
they separated in 1990.
Keith Ruddock was well-liked and
respected by all who met him and
will be sorely missed by his family,
friends and colleagues.
Imperial ranks fourth for research
MATHIEU RICHARD
The 1996 Research Assessment
Exercise, whose results were pub-
lished just before Christmas, show
significant improvements in the qual-
ity of U K research since 1992.
The survey, organised by the
Higher Education Funding Council
for England, evaluates the perfor-
mances of research institutions in 69
subject fields, classifying them in 7
categories, from 5* (excellence in all
sub-areas)to 1.
In 1992, the ex-polytechnics par-
ticipated in the survey for the first
time. This year, 192 universities took
part, covering a total number of
55,000 researchers. A clear rise in the
standards of research has been
accomplished, with a national aver-
age score higher by half a grade than
that in 1992.
Unsurprisingly, Oxford was
ranked top, closely followed by
Cambridge. However, not all the
results were so predictable.
Several universities far surpassed
expectations, with Goldsmith
College, for example, rising from
59th to 26th place and Bath
University, which made it into the
top ten.
The ex-polytechnics are clearly
still catching up on the research front
in comparison to the old universities.
Most occupy the lowest rankings in
the table apart from a few exceptions.
The figures show that most high-
level research is still done in English
universities but Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are now contribut-
ing more significantly. As Brian
Fender, HEFCE's Chief Executive
puts it "the real winner of this survey
is not Oxford, or any of the top rank-
ing universities but the United
Kingdom, which is benefiting from a
huge range of high-quality work."
Imperial College was ranked
fourth in the UK, after Oxbridge and
LSE, attaining an average grading of
5. A breakdown of this figure reveals
that of the research staff at IC, 26%
were awarded a 5*, 50% a grade 5,
and 22% a grade 4.
These results give a good overall
impression of the quality of research
at Imperial, but a more in-depth pic-
ture emerges when the 21 subjects
submitted by IC are assessed sepa-
rately.
The departments of the Royal
College of Science all obtained grade
5 or above, as did all the Engineering
departments. Pure Mathematics
recieved a 5* rating, leaving even
Cambridge behind.
Slightly inferior results were
achieved by the Royal Schools of
Mines and Business and
Management, though the grades did
not fall below a 4.
This was somewhat balanced by
the Medical School of Imperial
College, St Mary's, ranking top in
pre-clinical studies and the National
Heart & Lung Institute receiving 5*s
for all their departments, demonstrat-
ing IC's supremacy in hospital-based
subjects.
