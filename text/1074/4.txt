4 N E W S FELIX FRIDAY 10TH IANUARY
Further action from the AUT
MATTHEW BENNETT
The Association of University
Teachers, the largest union involved
in the one day strike in higher educa-
tion last November, is to ballot its
members on further action, which
could involve disruption of universi-
ties' admissions procedures and
exam marking.
The strike took place a week before
the November budget and may have
been one of the factors that lead to an
increase in higher education funding
of £100 million. This was hailed to
be a victory as, although it constitut-
ed a real term decrease in funding per
student of 0.5%, a fall of 3% was
anticipated. The Universities and
Colleges Employers Association,
who negotiate pay for staff in HE,
changed their offer of a pay increase
from 1.5% to 5% over two years.
This offer was rejected by the unions
involved in the dispute, and the
unions organised a "boycott of beu-
rocracy" which mainly involved non
co-operation in teaching quality
assessments, which are seen as
unnecessary and time consuming.
The unions rejected the improved
pay offer because it came with a
range of provisions and conditions
attached, which they deemed unac-
ceptable. One condition was that the
workers who went on strike would
have 1/260 of their annual pay
docked. The unions insisted that only
1/365 should be docked, asking
whether their members were only
expected to work 260 days a year.
UCEA subsequently amended
their offer to two years' increase of
2.5%, with fewer strings, including
the removal of the 1/260 clause, but
this was rejected by the unions.
The AUT committee had pledged
to give UCEA until the end of
November to produce a "satisfacto-
ry" pay offer. When this was seen as
unforfhcoming, further action was
suggested. The original ballot in
November covered "other action
short of a strike" and the unions
instructed members not to cooperate
with any reviews or assessments, to
work only to contract, and not to do
extra hours or carry out unpaid work
or teaching. Academic teaching staff
have been instructed to stop external
examining.
The A U T then announced their
intention to ballot members over a
possible boycott of exam marking
and a slowing down of admissions
procedures. It is the problems that
this will create for admissions that
the AUT says is "creating very con-
siderable political interest that will
help in convincing employers to
change their position". Notices were
sent to employers covering the inten-
tion to ballot in December, and the
papers are expected to be sent out this
week. Results are expected in late
January.
On a local level, IC are one of the
colleges who are sticking to docking
1/260 of the striker's pay, while
many other institutions have already
moved to the 1/365 scale. They did,
however, make a one off payment in
place of a pay increase to staff in
December as a "pay advance on
account" which was hailed by Mark
Scrimshaw, the secretary of the IC
AUT committee as a sign of the col-
lege authorities' sympathy to the
staff's pay demands.
More funding for Mary's CJD research
PAUL SQUIRES
Researchers at St Mary's Hospital
Medical School may soon be cele-
brating the arrival of a £1 million
Medical Research Council grant. The
funding will allow research into
prion diseases to continue, with par-
ticular reference to Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, an illness suspected to derive
from the so called 'mad cow' dis-
ease, Bovine Spongiform Encepha-
lopathy. The decision is to be taken
some time this month following sci-
ence budget allocations.
Professor John Collinge has been
leading the research group at St
Mary's and the extra funding would
allow him to develop plans for the
establishment of a research unit com-
mitted to neurodegenerative dis-
eases. The possibility of such an
offer comes after the recent success-
es of the Mary's team, which has
been the leading institution research-
ing into CJD. Last October they pub-
lished the first direct evidence indi-
cating the transmission of BSE from
cattle to humans, as reported in Felix
1067.
Professor Collinge also intends to
investigate new evidence that some
people may have a genetic predispo-
sition to the disease.
Also likely to benefit from M R C
funding is Harash Narang, a scientist
based in Newcastle. His controver-
sial research, especially his claim to
have developed a urine test for CJD
and BSE, has highlighted the need
for further research into this area.
Though in his case, far tighter initial
conditions are expected to be
imposed by the Research Council,
ensuring that his findings are verified
by other experts, before they agree to
fund him.
In response to a likely Office of
Science and Technology edict to
concentrate funding on CJD-BSE
research, the MRC's future alloca-
tions of grants will reflect the current
'beef crisis'. The OST is reported to
be considering 'top-slicing' around
£7 million of its own budget to fund
"scientific efforts" into BSE and CJD
research.
