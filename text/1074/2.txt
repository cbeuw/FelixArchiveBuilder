2 N E W S FELIX FRIDAY 10TH JANUARY
Waterstone's awarded Bookstore tender
continued from front page
get, but conceded that there was
"...no denying that the extent to
which the Union depends upon the
Governors has increased."
Waterstone's academic booksales
area manger Hereward Corbett
recounted being "chuffed to bits"
upon hearing the news of their suc-
cessful bid. Speculating as to why
they had won the tender, he drew
attention to the "powerful" IT invest-
ment Waterstone's had promised,
and the positive references from the
on-campus bookstores they already
operate at universities such as Bath
and UEA. Mr Corbett also pointed to
positive relations with College offi-
cials, saying "We got on really well
with them... after all, we are looking
for a partnership."
Outlining plans for the new book-
store, Mr Corbett explained that it
would broadly resemble the recently
refurbished branch at Notting Hill
Gate, but that an external designer
would be brought in to make the IC
store "a bit whizzy." The store will
operate with a core staff of eight, and
negotiations are already underway to
transfer existing staff directly from
the Union outlet. It is not yet clear
whether Waterstone's will offer part-
time jobs to students. Innovations
may include the sale of second-hand
books and a discount voucher
scheme. Although the new store will
stock a small selection of fiction
titles, Mr Corbett affirmed
Waterstone's commitment to make
the IC branch "The most authorita-
tive and comprehensive science and
technology bookshop in the coun-
try-
Defending the Union's ability to
manage, Mr Allsop claimed "College
have failed yet again to believe we
are capable of doing the job. All our
trading outlets have either come on-
line at a profit, or turned inherited
College loss-makers into successful
ventures... For example, the Union
bar and catering."
Mr Allsop went on to suggest that
some College administrators "are
already regarding with jealous eyes"
successful Union ventures such as
Da Vinci's Catering, and may be
seeking to control the way ICU funds
sporting clubs. The College already
makes direct contributions to select
groups, most notably the boat club.
Addressing the wider issues raised
by the College's decision, the ICU
President outlined the advantages of
Students' Unions running their own
trading outlets; they can offer a
friendlier and hence superior service,
they are receptive and adaptive to
students' needs and any surplus they
generate is wholly reinvested in
improved services. The profits from
trading outlets also afford ICU a
degree of financial autonomy, pro-
tecting it from the vagaries of nation-
al HE funding policy. Were this
autonomy to be removed, Mr Allsop
believes, the College would have
unprecedented control over Union
spending decisions. Although the
loss of the bookstore will have only
minor immediate consequences,
larger and longer-term projects, and
perhaps even the day-to-day running
of the Union may be increasingly
subject to College authority. This,
Mr Allsop maintains, could threaten
to remove IC students from future
decision-making processes, even
though they are the intended benefi-
ciaries of HE funding and ultimately
the customers of campus trading out-
lets.
F i r e a l a r m f a r c e
M A T T H E W K E M P T O N
On the last Friday of term students in
Southwell Hall, Evelyn Gardens had
to evacuate the building after an
impostor smashed five fire alarms.
At approximately 5pm fire alarms
started ringing in houses 56 and 57.
After waiting outside in the street,
where there was no roll call, the stu-
dents were moved into the main
entrance of the hall, where a bizzare
set of events followed.
A member of Evelyn Gardens
security ordered everyone to their
rooms while a subwarden blocked
the way to half the hall. At this point
a drunken man came in, calling him-
self the 'senior fire officer of
Imperial College' and ordered
everyone out. This was clearly not
the case as an argument followed
which ended with the security man
saying 'I don't know who the hell
you are, just get lost' and the impos-
tor leaving. Subwarden Guy
Franklin later discovered the
smashed fire alarms and also found
the 'fire officer' wandering around
trying to find his swipe card and
glasses. He was taken to see the war-
den Ken Young who discovered that
he had set off the fire alarms after
drinking with a friend. A discipli-
nary hearing will take place soon.
College mislays a
£million in cheques
N E W S T E A M
A major disaster for postgraduate
students was narrowly averted
thanks to the heroic efforts of the
College Student Finance Office, who
tracked down missing Engineering
and Physical Science Research
Council grant cheques worth nearly
£lm in total.
The absence of the cheques went
unnoticed until the 2nd January
although they were expected on the
last day of term.
In their defence, the Student
Finance Office cited several factors
that had contributed to the temporary
loss of the cheques. The system for
delivering funds has changed recent-
ly, in order to prevent institutions
investing the money. Following
Government initiatives, the EPSRC
has introduced the practice of send-
ing grant money only when it is due,
rather than paying colleges in full at
the beginning of the year. A decision
to send the money on the 23rd
December was reversed when the
SFO pointed out that College would
close on the 20th. The EPSRC
agreed to send them at noon on the
20th. Owing to bad weather the
courier was late, though this turned
out not to be the major
problem.. .seeing as he actually took
them to the Royal College of Art.
The security guard who signed for
the cheques at the time informed
Felix that he hadn't realised the
courier had got the wrong place, as
"...the package was small and the
address obscure."
Tony Cullen, Assistant Registrar,
expressed his concerns about the
matter ".. .only as a last resort would
we have cancelled the cheques. It
would have caused untold problems
and aggravation to a lot of people,
not least students needing to pay
their rent and the like."
Fortunately the cheques were
recovered on the 2nd and so they
were eventually issued only one day
late.
News in Brief
Y A N K S BEAT IC
On New Year's Day BBC viewers
had a chance to watch Jeremy
Paxman sneer at American as well as
British students in the International
University Challenge match between
Imperial College and the University
of Michigan.
IC started badly, and although they
drew level a couple of times,
Michigan leapt ahead in the last 10
minutes, beating IC by a wide mar-
gin. "We had an off day" said team
captain Mark Pallen. He also conced-
ed that Michigan were the better
team. In an attempt to excuse what
Paxman described as their dress,
Pallen stated that Granada had told
IC to dress casually but Michigan to
dress smartly.
However, it is not yet over for last
year's team; they are shortly to
depart for the States to compete in
their National Academic Quiz.
TRAFFIC B L A C K SPOT
It was a bad start to the new year for
the passengers of a white Volvo who
were involved in a serious car acci-
dent last Sunday. The incident took
place at the turning into Prince
Consort Road, just outside the
Physics Department. The road was
closed off for several hours and it
took firemen over an hour to free the
passengers, having to resort in the
end to cutting the roof of the car off.
In contrast the driver of the other car
involved escaped with minor
injuries.
The turning by the Huxley
Building seems to be something of a
traffic black spot. Last summer, as
reported in Felix, there was an acci-
dent involving an out-of-control
B M W and a stationary Rover.
Luckily there were no serious
injuries.
IC RADIO BROKEN INTO
Last weekend thieves raided
Southside Disco and escaped with
over £1500 of equipment belonging
to Imperial College Radio. Having
pulled the door away from the booth,
they made off with two record play-
ers, a CD player and a mixer.
College Security are at present
compiling a report on the theft.
, vnyone with any information on the
theft should contact Paul Brown or
Ian Hickvale, at IC Radio
