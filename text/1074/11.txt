12 S P O R T FELIX FRIDAY 10TH IANUARY
F e l i x s p o r t
IC Snooker t e a m defeat
n a t i o n a l champions
In their last inter-varsity match
before Christmas, the Snooker Club
travelled to Cardiff University to
play their reigning British Uni-
versities Sports Association national
champion team. The four intrepid
players who braved the trip were
Alex Robinson, Tim Dann and
recent Christmas Open finalists
Russell Towers and Simon Baugh.
The opening best-of-three matches
did not start well with two wins by
Tim, 2-0 and 2-1, before Simon lost
his first match 2-1.
The Imperial College team then
rose to the early threat with wins by
Russell 2-0, Simon 2-0 and Alex 2-0
and 2-1. After this phase IC led 13-8,
and seemed to have given them-
selves an unassailable position.
In the final single-frame legs, hon-
ours were even for Tim and Russell
taking a win and a loss each. Simon
then won both his one frame match-
es to produce a final victory margin
of 17-10 to IC.
This was a great result for the
Imperial College team, defeating the
best in the land, and hopes are high
for both the A and B teams if they
can continue this sort of top-form
into the BUSA play-offs next month.
Uni-Hoc start-up appeal
As you may have noticed, there is no
Uni-Hoc club here at Imperial
College. We think that it is about
time that there was!
Uni-Hoc is a brilliant game - fast,
furious - maybe occasionally violent
(all in the spirit of the game) and best
of all fun.
To the uninitiated it is merely an
indoor version of hockey, though
those who get to know it realise that
it is more along the lines, of ice-
hockey. Anyone can play - be they
male or female, beginners and pros.
Uni-hoc is a simple game and we
intend to play above-all for fun.
There are only a few rules (if any),
and games will generally be a good
excuse for a swift half or two after-
wards.
So, if you are interested, please
sign one of the posters around the
campus, or e-mail a.rugg@ic.ac.uk
or h.k.wong@ic.ac.uk - and we'll get
back to you with details of our plans
to establish IC's most exciting club!
