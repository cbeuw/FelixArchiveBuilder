10 C O L U M N S & N O T I C E S FELIX FRIDAY 10TH JANUARY
First things first, let me wish all of
you (or should that be both of you?)
a Happy New Year. Slight change to
the usual format this week as you
will see later, but first a couple of
things to deal with. Unfortunately
space does not permit me to mention
the execrably awful meal I endured
on my first ever trip to the SCR on
Monday. Shift the decimal point one
place to the left on your cash regis-
ters, College Catering, and you will
begin to charge what your products
are worth.
There is however time to mention
the grant cheque fiasco, reported
elsewhere, but you heard it here first.
Last Thursday the cheques for a sig-
nificant proportion of the Colleges
PhD students arrived in Sherfield.
No problem, I hear you cry. A simple
matter of delivering them to the
Student finance office, where these
things have been dealt with since the
dawn of time. But no, the cheques
went walkabout. So perambulatory
were they, the possibility of stopping
ifhem was contemplated on Friday
morning when they still hadn't sur-
Ifaced. Thankfully, they turned up
Ithat lunchtime and were promptly
dished out. What a start to 1997.

There now follows an open letter to
the Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, con-
cerning Campus Renaissance.
Dear Rector,
Firstly, let me thank you and Ian
Caldwell for the excellent presenta-
tion that you gave last term on
Campus Renaissance. Say what you
will about the Estates Division, and
frankly I have said more than most,
they are not short of ideas and vision.
The transformation of Queen's Lawn
and surrounding area looks awe-
some, and the proposed reappraisal
of Sherfield hinted at by Mr Caldwell
is most refreshing; I found it both sat-
isfying and unnerving that almost all
my questions and suggestions had
been anticipated! Quite rightly, the
accommodation has not been over-
looked, with the continued renova-
tion and expansion of the existing
stock. This, we were told would be
paid for by commercial activities,
principally conferencing. Here I
began to waiver.
The question you will recall I
asked concerned the funding of these
projects by conference profits. I
clearly failed to explain myself,
hence your somewhat terse respons-
es. The problems I have with this are
as follows. As Ian Caldwell said at
the presentation. College accommo-
dation is a net consumer of cash,
despite existing conferencing and
reasonably high rents to students.
This should be a cause of grave con-
cern, and rectifying it to an extent
should be relatively easy. All support
services, such as cleaning and main-
tenance, should be contracted out.
Imperial is in the business of educat-
ing not running service companies. It
also seems unnecessary for IC to
own the halls of residence. Whilst
acknowledging that Linstead Hall
could be an exception, the possibility
of selling the freeholds and leasing
back the buildings or mortgaging, as
is the trend in corporate property
management, should be investigated.
We have highly valued, poor per-
forming assets, tying up huge
amounts of cash. Only when the bot-
tom line is in a healthy condition
should large-scale investment be
contemplated.
As it is at the moment, I fear that a
likely consequence of the proposed
investment will simply drive up costs
to the point that the College prices
itself out of its chosen market, and
begin to compete with hotels and
other, more specialised providers.
This will inevitably put upward pres-
sure on student rents, which could
even force those for whom halls
would have been the natural choice
to seek accommodation elsewhere.
The way in which IC can generate
more revenue is not to expand ineffi-
cient low-margin activities, but to
first tackle waste, improve manage-
ment accountability and divest func-
tions better done by others. There is
enormous scope College-wide.
Wishing you and Lady Oxburgh a
Happy New Year.
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
I must be in luck: each
Monday morning I won-
der what I'm going to
write about for the week, and each time
another Tory M P takes a tumble. Jerry
Hayes, the 43 year old Member for
Harlow, is at the centre of yet another
sex scandal for the Conservative Party,
with an ex-researcher of his spilling the
beans to the News of the World. Sex
scandals are a serious business, in more
ways than one, and they usually follow
a set pattern: there is some basis in truth,
and some breathtaking naivete in the
MP's past. A press release then goes
round on Saturday, in time for the
Sunday vultures to prepare their stories.
Since MPs are taught to keep quiet in
these cases, the papers are full of the
other side's story. If the M P is a minis-
ter, he will resign immediately. If he is a
backbencher, he will return to face the
wrath of his constituency, populated
mainly by shocked elderly ladies.
This case has a nasty twist, however.
The story was released by his ex-
employee and one-time Young
Conservative Paul Stone, who received
£75,000 for the exclusive: a tidy packet
for a 24-year-old trainee accountant.
The role of Max Clifford, the ubiquitous
publicist who simultaneously an-
nounced his "vendetta" against the
Tories, is worrying: he freely admits he
timed the announcement with the Prime
Minister's new crusade on family val-
ues to cause maximum damage to the
Government, saying "in a new year and
in the run up to a General Election, it is
important to remind the British public ofj
the Conservative Party's real values."
He promises to reveal more scandals in
the coming months. His justification is
the poor treatment, at the hands of the
NHS, of his disabled daughter over the
last ten years, and he has taken it upon
himself to wreak revenge on the
Government. The Labour Party are
playing the long game: they have man-
aged to criticise Clifford for such a
brazen declaration and point out that
they never make political capital out of|
Tory scandals (although John Prescott
couldn't resist a quick jibe that "Major's
new push on family values was bound
to end in tears, and it has.") They are
acutely conscious that they may soon be
targets themselves.
Even the press are beginning to tire of |
these ceaseless scandals, with the
tabloids giving it headline news treat-
ment one day and completely forgetting
about it the next, and most broadsheets
fitting it around other more newsworthy
stories. With Paul Stone's supercilious
smile shining out of the paper's along-
side Max Clifford's horrendously arro-
gant presumptions, and a story based
purely on the word of 24-year-old with
a £75,000 cheque - no evidence has
appeared -1 am confident of where my
sympathies lie.
