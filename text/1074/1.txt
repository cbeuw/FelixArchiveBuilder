Students lose out to Water stone's
ROBIN RILEY
Staff and students of Imperial
College Union have reacted with dis-
may following the decision by
College to award the tender for the
new Bookstore to high street book-
sellers Waterstone's.
Unofficial notification of the deci-
sion came in a telephone call from
Professor Alan Swanson to Union
Manager Many Hurford on the last
day of term before the Christmas
break, and was confirmed verbally
later that day in an emergency meet-
ing between the Rector and ICU
president, Eric Allsop. At the time of
going to press, the Union has
received no official communication
regarding the decision but is in no
doubt as to the result, Waterstone's
having been informed of their suc-
cessful bid.
This has prompted the issue of a
strongly-worded press release by
Union executives, together with an
advertising campaign condemning
the decision. The new store, current-
ly under construction beneath the
main library, is due to begin trading
on April 19th. When the new branch
of Waterstone's opens, the Union
will be required to cease the sale of
books from its site situated on the
Sherfield walkway. According to
Union officials, the loss of the book-
store as a trading outlet may have
potentially devastating repercussions
for the way the Union operates, and
the scope of its activities.
Mr Eric Allsop expressed his frus-
tration at the lack of feedback on the
Union's losing bid: "I still can't see
what it was that Waterstone's could
have offered that we couldn't."
Union staff had high hopes for
their bid to tender, which reached the
last round of competition with
Waterstone's, beating Dillons,
Blackwell's and the Modern Book

Company. Mr Allsop suggested that
the College committee set-up to
advise the Rector on awarding the
tender may have adopted a "Corner-
shop mentality," labouring under the
belief that the Union, lacking the
resources of a national chain like
Waterstone's, would be unable to
operate a much larger store even
though it would have access to the
same suppliers, staff pool and
Information Technology facilities as
an external company.
The newly-appointed Deputy
Rector, Professor Alan Swanson,
was a member of the committee
which examined the bids to tender.
Speaking to Felix, Prof Swanson
explained that all five bids were of
similar quality, and that all five
organisations had produced very sim-
ilar estimates of the likely sales and
profitability of the new store. He
likened the decision to choosing
between equally competent candi-
dates at a job interview, saying
"Another group of people might have
made a different decision."
Reports suggest the committee
was asked by the Rector to focus
solely upon determining which
organisation would provide the best
service, and not to consider the wider
implications of each bid. This may
have hindered the Union's bid, one of
its main selling points being the fact
that profits would remain on campus.
Prof Swanson refused to be drawn on
whether, with hindsight, this some-
what blinkered approach had in fact
proven the best way to proceed. He
maintained that the objectives of the
committee had been clearly set out
by the Rector at the time of its cre-
ation. Answering the allegation that
the College had made a serious error
of judgement, Prof Swanson replied:
"College hasn't shot itself in the foot;
just maybe shot the Union."
The ICU President made clear his
dissatisfaction with the way the deci-
sion had been reached, and particu-
larly the timing of the announcement,
which came just before the Christmas
holiday. Mr Allsop reported that
Union staff were "absolutely gutted"
by the decision, and that morale was
at an all-time low. He concluded that
the decision by the College was
"., .the most devastating thing to hap-
pen to the Union for as long as I can
remember."
The ultimate role of the committee
in the final decision remains unclear.
It is not known whether the commit-
tee directly recommended Water-
stone's to the Rector, or whether it
merely advised him upon the advan-
tages and disadvantages of each of
the two finalist's bids. Further rec-
ommendations may have been made
by other groups, for example the
College Management Planning
Group. These questions may not be
fully answered until the Rector, Sir
Ronald Oxburgh, returns from a visit
to Hong Kong.
The Deputy Rector was keen to
repeat assurances that the shortfall in
the Union's trading surplus resulting
from the loss of the bookstore would
be covered by an increase in the
annual subvention. When pressed as
to whether this switch in sources of
income would affect the Union's
autonomy, Prof Swanson claimed
that the financing of most students'
unions is arbitrary. He went on to
explain that however well-run ICU's
trading outlets might be, they operate
from College property and so cannot
really be considered independent
sources of revenue. Furthermore,
Prof Swanson pointed out that the
loss of the bookstore affected only
around 7% of the Union's total bud-
