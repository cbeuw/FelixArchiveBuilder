Beer Prices Stay Down!!
Last Thursday the Refectory Committee decided
not to implement any Bar price rises, despite the
fact that trade is less than at the same time last
year. This is part of the overall decline in the
brewing industry as people can't afford to drink as
much as they used to, and our bars are suffering
along with outside pubs.
However Bar Committee unanimously felt that
price increases would only serve to drive custom
away to local pubs, or altogether, and therefore
not increase our total trade. Brewers increases
have already taken place this term, and the
budget is likely to bring more but these apply to
us and local pubs alike — we felt it most
important not to add any price rises of our own
which would narrow the price gap between us
and local pubs.
With the aid of a survey of local pub prices
(carried out by Marshalls on the Field Cup!), John
a n d I p e r s u a d e d D r S c h r o t e r , R e f e c t o r y
Committee Chairman, N O T to propose a 2p per
pint price rise to the Committee, which I think
shows what can be achieved by working together.
However we must not get complacent, and the
only way to keep our prices down is to use our
College Bars. At present outside pubs are 7-15p
per pint more expensive, and the more people
who use our bars, the less likely that this gap will
narrow.
The Ba r C o m m i t t e e is always willing to
consider suggestions for improvement, so if you
have any bright ideas, come and tell me about
them, or have a chat to one of our Committee
members responsible for monitoring the bars,
namely Rich Archer (in the Union Bar) and Roy
Francis (Southside).
Rape Alarm Prices Down!
I have found an alternative supplier for personal
rape alarms and am expecting a delivery soon.
They will be available from the Union Office for
£2.50.
Free Prescriptions
A S T H E L A S T meeting of the Health Services
User's Committee Dr Haines pointed out that
students can obtain their prescriptions free of
charge. This is worked out on the basis of
whether the individual has less than £20 per week
to live on, having paid rent for that week. Should
you fall into the category please pop along to the
Health Centre and gather up the relevant form. I
have a few here in the office and I will try to get
some more as soon as possible. If you need
prescriptions on at regular intervals season
tickets can be purchased. These cost £5.50 for
four months or £15 a year. This is well worth it
considering that each prescription now costs £1.
Please remember to vote on Monday and
Tuesday and don't forget about the U G M on
Thursday, March 12 at 1:00pm in the Great Hall.
All for now.

H A R R Y Y O U N G went to Moscow in 1922 as the
official representative of the British Young
Communist League. He later became a member
of the five-man secretariat of the Executive
Committee of the C o m m u n i s t Y o u t h Inter-
national and was on the committee which
expelled Trotsky from Russia in 1928. He had
personal knowledge of Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky,
and yet in 1930 he left Russia disillusioned with
the system and in 1940 joined the Socialist Party
of G r e a t Britain, an organisation which has
always maintained that since 1917 State
Capitalism, not Socialism, was being developed in
Russia. Why did Harry change his mind? Come to
this meeting and find out.
The meeting will be in the Union Upper Lounge
at 6:30pm on Monday, March 9 and is arranged
by Soc Soc.

A T L A S T ! or, shaU we say, s o m e t h i n g
approaching the ultimate! Well, hinted at broadly
The Home Counties Amateur Dramatic Festival
are moving actors and scenery, greasepaint and
props by the pantechniconfull into the Beit
Theatre. Though secrecy is prevalent between
the companies and the outside world (and even
between actors in the same show, it would
appear) it has been ascertained that the
competing groups are:
The Basingstoke Cultural Awareness Evening
Class Players, who have chosen an unknown
Russian masterpiece by a chum of Checkov (a
checkhov-mate one assumes);
Coe and Co., manufacturers of railway bogies
in Watford, are sending their Works' Theatre
Group, are to present a play in their tradition of
sophisticated thrillers. This item is believed to be
so sophisticated that the possibility that the butler
didn't do it cannot be ruled out!;
The little-known H D Lawrence provides the
story of North Country mining poverty portrayed
by the Wittering Dramatic and Model Aircraft
Club;
Finally in the final comes the Wapping Little
Theatre whose production is thought to reinforce
their campaign to prove that Shakespeare wrote
Bacon.
All the plays may be viewed on each of the four
nights Wednesday 11 to Saturday 14 March.
Tickets priced at £ 1 are available from the
Dramsoc Storeroom or the Bookshop.

deterrence, etc. In an effort to inform people
within College of the real arguments involved the
C N D group will soon be distributing to all
departments leaflets on some of these subjects.
