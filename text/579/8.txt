What's On
Brunt of the Runt
Dave M u s k e r has quit in his bid for President
of I C U . H e seems to share similar views to
myself o n a number of Union affairs, yet he
offered no solutions and now he has backed
down. H e didn't even have the courtesy to
inform me of his stand down so his manifesto
could be deleted. O r perhaps all he ever
intended was to air his views in public on a
Presidential platform without putting in the
a m o u n t of w o r k normally r e q u i r e d of a
Presidential candidate.
I a m glad he has stood down, his kind of
purile r a m b l i n g without t h e b a c k u p of a
determined character to see his complaints of
the Union corrected, deserves only contempt.

F r o m the present state of the music store, it is
clear that there isn't enough room there for the
choir to store all the equipment they would like
to. This was brought home to them when they
needed a grand piano for a rehearsal, but the
only one available was at the back of the store,
wedged in behind all kinds of other accoutre-
ments (see diagram).
A s if this wasn't enough of a problem, there
are two things complicating their predicament
even further.
Firstly, there's no room to rotate any of the
objects without damaging them, so the choir
will have to get the piano out by sliding things
backwards and forwards without turning them
round.
A n d secondly, there's an officious security
regulation which prohibits them from moving
anything out of the store (i.e. off the shaded
area) unless they are going to use it, and the
only thing they need to use is the grand piano.
The choir are now trying to work out how to
get that grand piano out of the store in the
fewest possible moves. A n y offers of help?
(Each move allows you to shift any one object.)
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o
FELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. £5 and
two tickets to the choir concert will go to the
solution which uses fewest moves.
Bir Zeit Controversy
I have received a number of letters (all but
one past the copy deadline) on the U N Society
article last week entitled "Study in the Shadow
of the G u n " .
Some of the correspondents seem to take
the line that F E L I X is in support of the article. I
should like to remind you that A L L clubs and
society articles express O N L Y their own views.
I do not agree with all articles printed in F E L I X
submitted in such a manner. If I only published
what I agreed with, that would be censorship.
I realise the article was lengthy, but this
should not be taken as support for it by
F E L I X — t h e writer felt he could not express
himself in less words.
I have no opinions myself on the article that I
wish to express in the pages of FELIX, except
that I would strongly defend their right to
express their own views.
Copy Deadline
People seem to be forgetting that the
F E L I X copy deadline for A L L copy is 5:30pm
Monday. With less people working on F E L I X
now due to exams this deadline will have to be
enforced to a greater extent. If you hand in
articles late then I'm afraid that it's just tough
titty.
V.GM.s
The hustings U G M yesterday was fun
(report next week). Don't forget the results
U G M this Thursday — see who you've been
fool enough to elect into office this year.
Thanks to
New staff member Zarathustra (no kidding
folks!), Mark, Patrick, Andy, Colin, Martin,
Phil, Shanne, Dave, Paul, Pallab, Steve, Ian &
Maz and all those people who voted the right
way.
Last week's solution
Clarinet piece by Brahms
String Quartet by Beethoven
Oboe & piano piece by Schumann
Piano Trio by Saint Saer.s
H o r n piece by Mozart
This very easy puzzle attracted a mixture of
rapturous approval and derogatory disgust,
which is what I've come to expect when I set
an easy puzzle. The winner is T i m Wright,
Maths 2, who can collect his cheque on
Monday afternoon.
Although the puzzle was easy, I had still
gone to a lot of trouble to make it musically
accurate. Pity so few people noticed.
