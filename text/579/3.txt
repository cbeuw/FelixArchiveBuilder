Ian MacGregor at IC
Bernie Pryor (last year's RSMU President and Prof Pryor's son) with Ian MacGregor
The Min and Met Soc Second Robert Pryor Memorial Lecture
on Tuesday was given by Mr Ian MacGregor, Chairman of the
British Steel Corporation.
Professor Pryor was H e a d of the Department of M i n e r a l Resources
Engineering when he died in J u l y 1979. Prof Pryor was also President
of the Institution of M i n i n g and Metallurgy 1978/9.
The Rector, the L o r d Flowers, chaired the meeting and during his
introduction of M r M a c G r e g o r commented: " I a n has held the job of
B S C C h a i r m a n for less than a year and already the L a d y wjio's not for
turning has injected a sum of money into B S C equal to the whole
Education budget. Thats not bad...I shudder to think what he'll do
next year."
M r Ian M a c G r e g o r complemented the high quality of teaching at
the R S M and said that he appreciated the honour of being asked to
speak by the M i n and M e t Society.
M r M a c G r e g o r began by outlining the history of the B S C . H e
underlined the inefficiency of corporation by comparing how many
people are employed to produce the annual output of 12-14m tons of
steel in the U K . W i t h the same output of plants in the U S A and J a p a n .
122,000 are on the B S C payroll, 38,000 people are employed in a
comparable U S establishment and only 12,000 are needed in J a p a n .
Besides the inefficient use of labour, M r M a c G r e g o r outlined the other
weaknesses that led to B S C losses, he emphasised that the cost of energy
was greater than those of its competitors because plants were closed at
weekends requiring a heating up period at the start of the week.
"Continuous working is essential."
" I n future B S C needs to become competitive. It is of p r i m e
importance to get costs down to the other competitors levels by vigorous
marketing and reducing the inefficient use of labour. L o o k i n g further
into the 80s; some experts predict a scarcity in steel coinciding with a
growth in the economy and the level of productivity," he said.
T h e L o r d Flowers commented that BSC's problems were immense
but the prospects were encouraging.
Sir Derek Ezra proposed a vote of thanks to Ian M a c G r e g o r : " W e all
have a vested interest in B S C and it will undoubtedly be a future
success".
T h e lecture was well appreciated bv the large audience who filled
M e c h E n g 220.

L o n d o n Division 1R champion-

victory over Q M C Seconds. The
title was just reward lor a side
which has played consistently
well this season, scoring a total
of 89 goals while conceding only
19. E q u a l top scorers with sixteen
a piece were M a l c o l m C a r r and
D i k V e e n m a n . O u t of e i g h t
matches played, only four points
were dropped away from home.

Do not go to jail
Collect £200
T H E I C U Monopoly R a g C o l -
lection was held last Saturday.
About twenty-three people all
from R C S U took part, and raised
£184.01. T h e top collectors were
a team from C h e m 2 who collected
over half the total.
T o e n c o u r a g e p a r t i c i p a t i o n
breakfast was supplied for R C S l
members in the U n i o n Office.
Traditionally an R C S U event,
two years ago Rae Snee (as R C S
V P ) decided the event would be
improved as a joint C C U event
paid for by I C R a g . As the event
was not very successful this year
it seems likely that control of the
event will return to R C S U next
vear. Paul Johnson said at the
R C S U Results U G M that this
vear I C U R a g had effectively
paid for a R C S U event. F E L I X
later suggested that by providing
breakfast for their members only
R C S L T
were effectively limiting
entries. This was countered by an
R C S E x e c s p o k e s m a n w h o
c o m m e n t e d t h a t a n y C C U
should be allowed to provide
food for their own members as
this was an optional part of the
event.

Report
I C U F I N A N C E C O M M I T T E E
met last T h u r s d a y to discuss
major claims.
T h e C o m m i t t e e a u t h o r i s e d
Mines to buy new football and
rugby shirts. This is the first time
for some years that Mines had
needed to buy shirts as they have
been donated by industry in the
past. C a v i n g C l u b have been
permitted to buy new ladders to
replace a set they had which are
now six years old and becoming
u n s a f e . T h e M i c r o c o m p u t e r
C l u b (only a year old, but with
over fifty active members) were
given £522 for a microcomputer.
The Snooker C l u b were allocated
enough money to buy their table.
(On Wednesday House C o m m i t -
tee gave them the use of the old
T V L o u n g e / I C W A L o u n g e ) .
Dramsoc can now buy new stage
lights, which form part of their
five year plan. Sailing C l u b are
able to buy a new Dinghy as part
of their five year plan. F E L I X
was allocated money to buy an
olfset litho printing machine off
the M a t h s D e p a r t m e n t . I C
R a d i o can now buy a cassette
recorder for outside broadcasts.
Guilds were given money to have
one of Bo's back wheels repaired.
T w o s t u d e n t s g o i n g to a n
Educational Conference in Z u r i c h
w e r e g i v e n h e l p w i t h t h e i r
expenses.
A proposal that major claims
should now be more than £100
was accepted. A l l claims put to
the meeting were agreed to and
one U F C member commented
that there was, perhaps, a lack of
questioning on some items.
Occupational
Hazard
S T U D E N T S F R O M colleges
throughout L o n d o n have begun
an occupation at Senate House,
the administrative centre of
L o n d o n University.
About forty students are
occupying the ground floor as a
protest against the Government's
policy on Overseas Student fees.
D u r i n g the week, students at L S E
and Queen M a r y College also
staged protests at their o w n
colleges, and the sit i n at
University College is continuing,
more than a week after it began. It
seems possible that U M I S T will
stage l i g h t n i n g strikes a n d
Sheffield University may also
have a sit-in. Students currently
involved with the L o n d o n sit-in
asked this week for support from
I C students, either by assisting
with the current protest, or
starting another.
