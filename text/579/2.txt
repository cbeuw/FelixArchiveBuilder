Dear Mr Marshall
I'm writing to make a couple
of points about I C refectories as
c o m p a r e d to other u n i v e r s i t y
refectories. Being a third year
applying for PhDs, etc., I've had
the pleasure of sampling food at
L a n c a s t e r , B i r m i n g h a m a n d
Warwick.
A t Lancaster you could get a
good three course meal with a
choice of several main courses
and deserts for £1. T h e tables
were ready laid and the cutlery,
etc., was spotlessly clean, and
there was even someone to collect
the dishes after you had linished!
At B i r m i n g h a m I was taken to
the stall refectory where a very
good main course and pudding
was £1. There was a wide choice
and the standard was extremely
h i g h . T h e c u t l e r y a n d tables
again were clean. I was also told
that a two course meal in the
union was about 60p.
A t W a r w i c k a g o o d m a i n
course was about 50p and there
was a choice of about six. Again
the food was excellent. They had
serviettes saying "University of
W a r w i c k Catering Service, our
aim is to please at a l l times". I
only wish the same could be said
about our catering.
I a m in Linstead H a l l and
therefore forced to sample at least
three meals per week at £1.37
each (or at least pay for them).
The standard is far lower than at
any other university I've sampled,
more expensive, a n d there's no
choice ol food. T h e crockery and
cutlery is often not as clean as it
ought to be and the food is often
cold. W e often throw it in the bin
after one mouthful.
I f o t h e r u n i v e r s i t i e s c a n
p r o v i d e a good m e a l w i t h a
c h o i c e for a r o u n d £\ for a n
u n k n o w n n u m b e r o f p e o p l e ,
surely Mooney can for £1.37 lor a
known number.

Dear Sir
There are a number of com-
m e n t s I w o u l d l i k e to m a k e
c o n c e r n i n g t h e C o n s o c p o l l
published in last week's F E L I X .
F i r s t , I f i n d it d i f f i c u l t to
believe that a poll carried out i n
this fashion by a n y p o l i t i c a l
group, not just Consoc, can hope
to produce a meaningful result.
Second, a n d specifically on the
disarmament questions, it is clear
that if these questions had been
phrased and ordered differently
quite opposite response might
have resulted. A n equally valid
o p e n i n g q u e s t i o n c o u l d have
been: " D o you believe there will
be a nuclear w a r i n your life-
time?" Perhaps followed by: " D o
you expect to survive such a
w a r ? " A n o t h e r e x a m p l e o f
Consoc's bias on this issue can be
seen in the February edition of
the C o n s o c C o m i c , M o r n i n g
C l o u d . I n s t a t i n g t h e i r case
against C N D the C h a i r m a n had
this to say about the cost of
Britain's independent deterrent:
" . . . t h e cost o f m a i n t a i n i n g
Britain's nuclear deterrent (as
opposed to introducing a new
system) is about £126m per year
— or less than the annual budget
o f t h e L o n d o n B o r o u g h o f
C a m d e n " . It is, of course, the
£5,000m which will be spent on
the new Trident system that is
the important figure. Finally, I
would just like to mention last
term's U G M where at least five
times the number of students
polled by Consoc voted by a
large majority in favour of C N D .

Dear Sir,
Last week I was distressed by
the double booking of the Concert
H a l l from the 11th to 14th of
M a r c h , with the classic Italian
O p e r a 'II Fornicazione' clashing
with our o w n final of the H o m e
Counties A m a t e u r Dramatic
Festival. After discussion with the
director of 'II Fornicazione' we
have agreed to r u n the two shows
concurrently, opening each night
with a shortened version of the
opera. A s a concession we have
agreed to allow the opera to take
part in the competition, which
will incidentally be judged by the
audiences. T h e results will be
published in the national press
(and in F E L I X ) . Tickets are
a v a i l a b l e f r o m b o t h y o u r
Dramsoc and the bookshop.
I would like to thank M r
Lovett, the director of T l
Fornicazione' for his cooperation
in this matter.

Dear Sir
W e w i s h o u r utter disgust
about a certain phrase which
appeared both in the editorial of
N o 577 (referring to the capabili-
ties of H R H Princess Anne) and
also i n the letters t o the Editor in
N o 578 (referring to your own
special talents). This phrase ("the
intellect of a cauliflower and the
ability of a mollusc") degrades
not only the common slug but a
variety of other species in this
phylum — snails, whelks, oysters,
squid, octupuses, etc.
If you want to go insulting
harmless invertebrates we suggest
t h e c o e l e n t e r a t e s , C r u s t a c e a ,
echinoderms or arachnids but not
the molluscs.
W e d e m a n d a n i m m e d i a t e
apology.

"Benefit" Carnival, duly having
paid £3 on the door, we the
undersigned should like it to be
k n o w n that we d i d not f i n d
'Otway a n d Barrett' i n the least

We would like to correct your
article of last Friday which stated
that everyone left the Carnival at
the end of O t w a y a n d Barrett's
act; they left B E F O R E the end of
their performance (a wise move!).
H a v i n g r e a d y o u r a r t i c l e we
suppose that Links must have
p a i d a sizeable c h u n k of the
£1,800 take at the door to the

Dear Sir
O n e c o u l d w r i t e at great
length filling in the very biased
history of Palestine and Israel in
the article " S t u d y in the Shadow
of the G u n " ( F E L I X 578), but I
s h a l l r e s t r i c t t h i s l e t t e r to
p r o v i d i n g a little i n f o r m a t i o n
about B i r Zeit University.
Under the Jordanian occupa-
tion from 1948 to 1967 there were
no universities i n J u d e a a n d
Samaria, a n d the J o r d a n i a n
a u t h o r i t i e s r e f u s e d to g r a n t
university status to any institu-
tion seeking it. However, under
Israeli administration since 1967,
advances have been made i n the
educational field, a n d these are
now two full-fledged universities
and two colleges i n J u d e a and
Samaria.
Bir Zeit, a secondary school
during most of the Jordanian
occupation was accorded univer-
sity status in 1973. Since then, its
student body has risen to 1,500.
T w o years ago, approval was
given for the opening of new
faculties, the enlargement of the
board of governors and a large
scale building programme.
The institution enjoys com-
plete academic freedom. There
is no interference i n its p r o -
g r a m m e o f s t u d i e s a n d n o
administrative restrictions are
imposed on the running of its day
to day affairs.
The F E L I X article states that
O r d e r N o 854 issued by the West
Bank Military Governor in J u l y
1980 aimed to curb the academic
freedom and enable the occupa-
tion authorities to interfere to a n
unprecedented extent. In view of
the fact t h a t J o r d a n i a n l a w
applicable in the area included
no provision for the establish-
ment or funding of universities
and in order to avoid a legal
vacuum, the Israeli Authorities
decided to provide a legal and
administrative framework for the
f u n c t i o n i n g o f u n i v e r s i t i e s ,
s i m i l a r to those e x i s t i n g w i t h
respect to universities throughout
the world.
A c o m m i t t e e o f l e g a l a n d
educational experts considered
various forms of legislation and
chose to amend the Jordanian
Education a n d Culture L a w (No
16) 1964 by extending its appli-
cation to universities in the Area,
thereby preferring to maintain
local law rather than introducing
new legislation, or rely upon the
m o r e r i g o r o u s g o v e r n m e n t
supervisory p r o v i s i o n s of the
A m m a n University L a w .
Order N o 854 thus extends the
application of the J o r d a n i a n law
to the i n s t i t u t i o n s for h i g h e r
education set up in the area since
the commencement of the Israeli
Administration. O n the basis of
Israel's obligations under Inter-
national L a w to ensure public
order a n d safety, considerations
of public order were added to the
critieria for granting licences for
the establishment of educational
i n s t i t u t i o n s . S i m i l a r l y , t h e
possibility of considering convic-
t i o n f o r s e c u r i t y offences o r
a d m i n i s t r a t i v e d e t e n t i o n was
added to the criteria for appoint-
ing or transferring teachers, and
a system of entry permits was
instituted in order to prevent
infiltration into universities a n d
