Charles Fuller was returned
unopposed for H J T and T o m

Academic Affairs Officer.
The meeting also gave the first
r e a d i n g to t h e n e w R C S U
Constitution, but a move to make
the U G M the sovereign body of
R C S U was defeated. A t present
the R C S U General Committee is
the governing body, and is made
u p o f a c a d e m i c a n d s o c i a l
representatives from all depart-
m e n t s , U n i o n o f f i c e r s , a n d
others.
Chris Price
atlC
After an opening volley on Tory
h o u s i n g p o l i c y , C h r i s t o p h e r
Price, M P admitted that this was
L a b o u r ' s " A c h i l l e s ' h e e l " .
(Nearly all L a b o u r M P ' s own
their own homes). M r Price then
turned his attention to private
clinics, which he saw as a threat
to the N H S saying that "doctors
kill more people than they save".
H e even blamed Labour's 1970
election defeat on pressure from
the medical profession! M o r e was
to follow; he proposed taking
over public schools and using
t h e m f o r " B o r s t a l s , m e n t a l
i n s t i t u t i o n s , a n d c o m m u n i t y
centres". A t this point there was
a loud burst of applause (not
from the ten people at this talk
but from the audience for the
Secretary of State for Education,
•Mark Carlisle, who was speaking
one floor below). So this ill-fated
and ill-timed event came to an
end.
Ed's Note: D u r i n g the course of
the meeting our reporter, per-
haps r a t h e r o v e r e n t h u s i a s t i c
about his first assignment called
M r Price a " s i m i a n m o r o n " and
" a n addle-brained baboon" and
was forcibly removed. I'm not
surprised.

Coe at Hyde Park
S E B A S T I A N C O E was one of the hundreds of students who took part
in Imperial College's H y d e Park Relay last Saturday.
The relay was sponsored by the National Westminster Bank and staff
from the College branch helped organise the event.
The team from Imperial spent most of their time marshalling and so
didn't win a medal. Seb's team from Loughborough won the relay in
record time, and the event was extensively covered by the national
press.
