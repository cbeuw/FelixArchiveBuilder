Carlisle visits College
The timely Conservative Society invitation for the Secretary of
State for Education, the Rt Hon Mark Carlisle, MP to visit the
College gave overseas students an oppurtunity to discuss the
differential fees issue.
M r Carlisle said: " O n e regrets having to make the decision to
introduce 'full cost' fees for overseas students but their numbers had
grown to such a size that it cost over £100m per year merely to
subsidise their fees.
" T h e L a b o u r Government tried reducing the quota but it didn't work.
The result was a totally indescriminate choice of students without
enquiries into their financial situation. W e thought that it was right to
do away with indescriminate subsidies.
" I would like to give more individual assistance to students from
parts of the world that one wants to help but it is not easy to decide
who should have the top priority. British dependents or students from
Cyprus, who have not home universities, or people from the developing
world all deserve consideration."
M r Carlisle disputed the L o n d o n Student Conference's findings that
overseas students provide a net inflow of £32m, commenting, "the
Overseas Student Trust have stated that there was no validity in the
figure of £32m or that overseas students will enhance our economic
situation in future. In the end it comes down to the question — what
can we do to help political needs?"
Besides hearing questions on overseas student fees, M r Carlisle gave
a general talk on British Education. H e linked the future of industry
changes of attitudes in education. " W e must emphasise the importance
of mathematics and science. M o r e girls should be encouraged to take
engineering rather than persuaded at the age of fourteen that the
subject is not for t h e m " .
M r C a r l i s l e c o n c l u d e d by s a y i n g : " I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e is an
amalgamation of three colleges, the R o y a l College of Science, the
R o y a l School of Mines, and C i t y and Guilds. That combination is a
marriage which not only succeeds at Imperial but is a marriage
necessary lor the success of British industry as a whole".
Hairline Causes
Controversy
Dave Gayor, City and Guilds
President, had his haed totally
shaved on Sunday in the Union
Bar, at the Guilds Election Bar
night.
M r Gayor told F E L I X that he
considered having his head
shaved to be well worth it, as
£300 had been collected for Rag.
Even with his head shaved he did
not look as funny as Rich Archer.
A lady friend of Dave's expressed
a favourable opinion on his new
'clean cut' appearance, although
in general the " M r Smooth"
image has met with mixed
reaction.
Star Man at IC
Patrick Moore, Britain's most famous amateur astronomer, gave a
lecture about the planet Mars in the Physics Dept. last Friday evening .
The lecture organised by the recently reformed Astronomical S o c , was
well attended and included a general question session.
After a brief guide to the conditions on the planet of the solar system, a
historical outline of the astronomical observations of Mars was
given. D r . Moore outlined every-
t h i n g f r o m P e r c i v a l L o w e l l ' s
famous 'canals' to the recent
Viking mission. This has dispelled
the commonly held opinion that
M a r s c o u l d s u p p o r t at least
primitive vegetation. The planet is
now known to be a small, arid
world with a tenuous atmosphere
which could not support life as we
know it.
However, he concluded with an
appraisal of the possibility of
colonizing Mars. Of all the planets
it appears that Mars would best
suit a self s u p p o r t i n g h u m a n
c o l o n y living in an e n c l o s e d
environment.
W h e n asked by F E L I X about his
regular appearance on the B B C ' s
S k y A t N i g h t p r o g r a m m e he
quipped, "I'll stay on as long as
they'll have me!"
Patrick Moore was 58 on Wed-
nesday. We at F E L I X wish him a
very happy birthday and the best
of luck for the future.
