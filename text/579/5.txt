Development is the keynote at National
Semiconductor in Greenock. Product
development, plant development and, most
importantly, personal development.
Growth in personnel, product range
and production facilities is already taking
place at National — a process that, by 1984,
will result in a trebling of the workforce to
over 2,000 and a four times increase in the
W e n e e d : —
size of our fabrication areas. Planned,
sustained growth for the future. Your future.
To maintain this growth we need
graduates from a wide range of disciplines.
Electronic Engineering, Physics, Chemistry
and Metallurgy. We also need commitment,
dedication, enthusiasm and more than a
dash of "pioneering" spirit.
