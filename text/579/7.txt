A L A S , the B team didn't play last week and as a
result there was a distinct lack of excitement
and thrills.
However the A team and C team played and
they tried hard to make up for the B team's
absence. T h e A team travelled to Bedford
College and played under trying conditions.
The bar was miles away, the table was so dirty
that they could have grown potatoes on it. The
A team still gave a good account of themselves
by winning 4-1. The C team won against L S E A
team by 3 frames to 2. This was rather a poor
result for us and the C team are gradually but
surely slipping down the league.
Football Seconds
IC made heavy weather of disposing of U C
Thirds a n d it was certainly doubtful as to
whether a 4-0 scoreline was a true reflection
on the game. After taking an early two goal
lead IC relaxed and allowed U C to build
attacks, any of which could easily have
led to a goal. IC's first goal came when
Wiggins fired his shot from the edge of the
box into the corner of the net. A couple of
minutes later, one of a string of corners was
cleared only to be pumped back towards
Lakin who beat the offside trap and then the
keeper to give IC a two nil lead.
With about twenty minutes to go, IC started
to produce the football that has put them near
the top of the league. Hartland continued his
impressive scoring record for the seconds
when he beat the advancing keeper with a fine
shot and the game was finally made safe when
Armstrong took advantage of confusion in the
U C defence, with a shot from inside the box.

Football Sixths
T H E Sixths travelled south to Cobham on
Saturday for what was, on paper, their most
difficult match of the season.
The Sixths started confidently, within one
m i n u t e C h a m b e r l a i n h a d w o n a c o r n e r ,
following which Roche received the ball in
the area and smashed it in. Inspired by Flynn
who made an impressive debut the Sixths
began to play s o m e g o o d football. T h e
second goal was not long in coming, Martin's
through ball found Haberlin unmarked in the
penalty area, who crashed the ball into the
net. Roche scored the sixths third goal when
he latched on to Tinkler's pass and flicked the
ball t a n t a l i s i n g l y into the net. With t h e
d e f e n c e ; H i g h a m , B r a d l e y , H a b e r l i n ,
Gartside, and Flynn more than equal to the St
Thomas' attack IC were able to continue
p r e s s i n g f o r w a r d . T h e o n e c h a n c e S t
Thomas' had in the first half was ably saved
by Hampton.
The second half was more even. St
Thomas' relied heavily on two fast forwards
and long drop kicks from their goalkeeper but
these tactics proved ineffective against the
Sixths defence. St Thomas' did score early in
the second half when a free kick skimmed off
Haberlin's head and skidded past the luckless
H a m p t o n A f t e r t h i s s e t b a c k t h e S i x t h s
reclaimed their hold on the game and Martin
and Coussens both narrowly failed to increase
the Sixths lead. St Thomas' showed they
weren't going to give in easily when they hit
the post but minutes later Chamberlain's shot
just missed and Tinkler watched his shot fly
just wide. At the end of the game the Sixths
had won three-one and put themselves in a
very good position to win the league.
T E A M : Hampton, Higham, Bradley,
Haberlin, Flynn, Tinkler, Martin, Gartside,
Coussens, Roche, Chamberlain, Caseau.
Sailing
T H E team was in Southampton on Saturday
and was crushingly defeated by a very strong
opposition. To make matters worse, South-
ampton who would probably beat IC at the
"Harp", were sailing their own boats (G.P.
14's) on Southampton Waters.
However it was not a completely wasted
day. Once the team had lost its league points,
the sailing conditions being nothing short of
excellent, numerous "friendlies" were sailed.
This gave the IC team the opportunity to get a
measure of the boats (for next year?).
T E A M : Allport, Chadwick, Mills, Murray,
Redman, Younghusband.
Hockey Seconds
A very successful afternoon for the Second XI
was marred only by the reluctance of certain
p l a y e r s to s c o r e h a t - t r i c k s ! D u e to t h e
a b s e n c e of c a p t a i n a n d X - r a y s p e c i a l i s t
M a s o m , G r a y elected to play himself at
sweeper With this thought in mind, the IC
forwards started in search of a few quick
goals. Despite intense early pressure and
near misses by C o r n w e l l a n d S t r o o m e r
Birkbeck held out and it began to look as if
Gray might get a touch of the ball! Finally
Cornwell rounded the keeper and slammed
the ball home to open the scoring. Shortly
afterwards Chew scored the second from a
short corner, the ball taking almost as many
deflections as Pete Hughes has had green
cards!
The end of the first half saw some excellent
hockey from IC with flowing moves down
both sides of the pitch. However, half-time
was taken with the score still 2-0. It didn't stay
that way for long; Garms, obviously inspired
by the half-time talk, took eighteen seconds
to score the first of his two goals. These were
split by a penalty, just about converted by
Chew! Then the forward line was thrown into
total confusion by the sight of full-back Mike
Clift gleefully charging down the pitch in a
way that gave a totally new meaning to the
term "dummy run"! After we had recovered,
there was just time for Dave Cornwell to make
the final score 6-0 with a well taken goal.
T E A M : Jones, Gray, Clift, Pound, Rao,
Stroomer, Chew, Garms, Afilaka, Cornwell,
Mitchell, Shaw (Umpire).
Football Fourths
A F T E R a reshuffle of the side the fourths
arrived at Ditchley with eleven players, three
who were making their first appearance for the
Fourths.
IC were on top from the start and soon took
the lead after a good run from Buckley who
gave a good pass to Dolan who scored from a
narrow angle. Five minutes later IC went two
nil up after an excellent dive from Hartland
with B u c k l e y s c o r i n g from the r e s u l t i n g
penalty. IC went close several more times in
the first half Griffiths particularly unlucky not
to score with a close range header but at half
time the score was 2-0.
Q M C scored a shock goal early in the
second half a long range shot just beating
Veats in goal. Soon after Milner was unlucky to
give away a penalty. Fortunately the over
enthusiastic Q M C penalty taker placed this
well over the bar. IC got their third goal after
Davies chased a through ball from Saunders
and scored with a well placed shot. Q M C
quickly pulled back another goal while the IC
defence wasn't looking, before Maddy placed
a good shot to put IC 4-2 up. Q M C were again
allowed back into the game when they were
awarded a penalty after a firm challenge from
Chown. Veats did well to reach tne penalty
but couldn't quite stop it! IC finished of the
game with Hartland finally getting a goal in.
T E A M : Veats, Milner, Maddy, Griffiths,
Chown, Abedajo, Buckley, Dolan, Davies,
Hartiund, Saunders.
PS: Thanks to all those non-regular fourths
who played for us.

Football Seconds
IN THIS C R U C I A L last match of the season,
the seconds got off to a fine start, playing
some devastating football which had Q M C ' s
d e f e n c e in t e r r i b l e t r o u b l e . S a u n d e r s '
impressive dive persuaded the referee to
award a penalty which was converted by
Beer, hitting his shot firmly into the corner of
the net for a 1-0 lead. T h e second quickly
followed when Saunders completed a good
move from the right with a shot from close
range. A s usual, IC then relaxed a little and
e n a b l e d Q M C to work s o m e d a n g e r o u s
moves, although Lay hit a marvellous curling
shot into the top right hand corner to make it
3-0. Q M C struck back however to make it 3-1
and at half-time, the game was certainly not
safe. Within the first minute of the second half
though, Hartland had made it 4-1 and IC's
fifth from Veenman followed soon after. A
good, if somewhat patchy performance, was
capped when Hartland turned elegantly on
the edge of the box and fired his shot inside
the near post to make the final score 6-1.
My thanks to all those who have played for
the seconds during the season and to those,
whose hard work in organising the Football
Club, has made everything possible.
Two major factors in the teams success
were the C l u b ' s s t r e n g t h in depth w h i c h
enabled the Seconds to field a very strong
side on every occasion, and the tremendous
spirit that made playing in the team such an
enjoyable occupation.
T E A M : A Williams, S Dunhill, J Beer, M
Armstrong, P Lakin, D Griffiths, J Lay, R
Wiggins, D Veenman, A Hartland, D Saun-
