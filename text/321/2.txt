EDITORIAL
on
Power of Editors
A lot is talked about the power of the Editor in
student newspapers. Taking the national dailies and
Sundays as examples, critics both state and believe
that the Editor, having dictated his policy to his staff,
invariably alters every article to suit his own political
or other doctrines; or, should this be impossible, either
leaves out the article altogether or reduces it to trivia
by judicious use of accompanying matter and headings
or snide editorial comments, or by placing the article
in an entirely incongruous position.
In the case of national
newspapers, it is true that
such policy is actively
pursued. After all, the
journalists are paid to
follow the Editorial line.
The primary object of
national newspapers is to
make money. No business-
man sinks millions of
pounds in a newspaper
just for the sheer hell of
it. In order to keep any
paper going, advertising is
necessary, and a lot of it;
to get a lot of advertising,
the publisher has to sell a
lot of copies to the sort of
people the advertisers
want to sell to. The edi-
torial content is adjusted
according to the sort of
readership the advertisers
want. The spectrum of
style and political thought
of newspapers is as wide
as the spectrum of adver-
tising markets.
Take an example. A
very useful market for
many advertisers is the
mature businessman or
professional man and his
wife, who can afford to
enjoy their creature com-
forts, and own a nice
bungalow in a good resi-
dential district. Quite a
number of them are pro-
bably retired officers from
the services. These people
form the majority of the
buyers of expensive cars,
furniture, spirits, etc.; the
"Style Goods". By sheer
coincidence, these people
just happen, in general, to
be dyed a deep blue, are
quite reactionary, go to
the opera, go to the races,
and are strong believers
in the Empire. Do you
begin to recognise the
leanings of the Daily T.?
So certainly in the case
of the nationals the Edi-
tor dictates the policy and
ensures that every article
published conforms with
it. This policy is in turn
dictated by the adver-
tisers. If there were a
number of advertisable
products that appealed
especially to Buddhists
living in Scarborough
and voting Communist, it
would not be long before
the "Scarborough Budd-
hist Morning Star"
appeared on the news-
stands.
This is not the case
with student newspapers.
Only one of them in
Britain is just about self-
supporting through adver-
tising Sennet), and even
here the advertisers just
want to advertise to stu-
dents —• not any particu-
lar sect of them. So there
is no reason why "there
should be hard and fast
editorial policy in student
newspapers. After all, the
purpose of student papers
is to inform and entertain
students — not to indoc-
trinate them.
The life blood of a stu-
dent newspaper is not its
Editor. It is its staff, the
people who give up their
free time to go to meet-
ings, interview people, do
background research, and
write articles about it all.
The people who spend
their free, time designing
page layouts. The people
who come and polish up
other people's contribu-
tions, and make them li-
terate and fit the space
available. The people who

THALIDOMIDE,
and why we should
boycott Distillers9
The drug "Disteval", otherwise known as Thali-
domide, was withdrawn from the open market in
1961 on account of its danger to human life. The
past decade has been characterised by .legal Im-
passe in the Courts and staid acquiescence on the
part of the drug distributors. Distillers' Company
{Biochemicalsf Ltd., with the result that Thali-
domide victims have received little or no recom-
pense.
In 1968 62 of the 430 Thalidomide victims
agreed to a settlement of 40 per cent, of what they
might have expected amounting to £16,200 per
child.
LAST YEAR DCL GROUP PROFITS WERE
£64 MILLION.
Why do DCL refuse to face up to their responsi-
bility in this matter, when in a recent poll of some
of their shareholders, 70 per cent, thought the
offered compensation inadequate?
Why have they tried to silence public debate on
the matter by legal action against the Sunday
Times, and why, if the Court is truly concerned
with "the public interest" did it not consider the
voracity of the articles in question?
It should not be the Government's job to meet
the obligations of DCL.
Are DCL worthy of your continued custom?
Come to the Union Meeting this Tuesday.
Vote to boycott Distillers' products.
A Letter FROM
the Editor
Dear Readers,
It seems that lots of people are still not manag-
ing to find me, and have curious ideas as to my"
whereabouts. Well, since I have to go out to see
advertisers, agents and on other necessary Felix
business, all of which has to be done during office
hours, it means I am out fairly frequently. There-
fore, by popular request, I am instituting "Office
Hours". Unfortunately I can't promise to stick to
them, but I'll do my best (and it's certain that I'll
be there at other times too).
Here goes :

It also seems that people are STILL trying to ring
me on Internal 2881. If you want to know why I
never answer, well, it's 'cos the phone isn't con-
nected! Ring PG extension 2229, which IS con-
nected.
Love,

Mugging, Big Dogs
and Twelve Foot
Tools
Evening Standard headline . . . "Mugging
is on the Increase, says J.P."
The popular press has a peculiar knack of
seizing on to some minor new trend or in-
cident which it considers to be anti-society
and giving it high prominence. A major section
of the public, knowing no better, duly respond.
Several Conservative M.P.s duly respond. The
prominence is maintained until the next bit of
trivia comes along.
So mugging is on the increase. Well, of
course it is. The word only came into vogue
recently so it had a zero rating Just a few
months ago. Since then almost every single
form of violence and direct theft has progres-
sively become classified as mugging.
Certain sections of the community often
figure in these onslaughts. Much destructive
criticism is dissipated on youth; bestiality is
often condemned by newspapers owned by
old men who are too old to enjoy it or younger
men who sell their papers by obsessively high-
lighting it. Particular fringe sections — stu-
dents, rock groups etc. — who exist outside
the accepted day's work, day's pay, marry the
girl/boy who you dropped/dropped you in the
club who lives in the next street, think like
dad/mum syndrome come in for special treat-
ment.
It doesn't even have to be people engaging
everyone's attention. If you were to search
through the past ten years of newspapers one
bathetic press occurred about April last year
when all the Alsatians in the country were ap-
parently conducting a vigorous terrorist cam-
paign against small children. (No doubt, if
this were to be repeated now we would see
headlines like "Another Dog Baby-mugging
in Fulham".) Looking through that 10 years of
press offerings would also put events into per-
spective and probably only a handful of head-
lines would be at all relevant to the history
of the period.
It would also show the way certain words
and expressions come in and out of fashion.
Recent in-vogue terms are "chauvinist",
credibility", "juggernauts" and "environ-
ment"; before that "viable" and "pragma-
tism". New words and expressions spring up
though these usually appear in non-establish-
ment publications since new is deemed equiva-
lent to unconventional:—
"Like, man, it's too much. Got any
straights, man. Got the skins and grass, man
Wow, feel real heavy. Pass me some bread,
man. Must score a Wimpy" OR
"Jeez, Sheelagh. Must go choke a Darkie be
fore I part the Tiger all over the Ferrett" OR
"Bag of Spam' 'etc.
Just as the written and spoken word
changes so other visual forms of communica
lion alter — new art forms, advertising gim-
rickry, grafitti etc. Drawing highly decorative,
disproportioned male organs seems to have
reached epidemic poularity in the Monastic
sanctuary of IC in recent years and the guys
who drew a twelve foot tool for ail to see from
College block certainly knew the quickest way
of getting a response from the College.
I just pity the guy Who cleaned it all off.
That's penile servitude for you!
