Last Wednesday, at
about 9.30, a robbery
took place within Imperial
College.
The National West-
minster Bank has a
branch with the College
and regularly has money
delivered to it.
This time, however, two
men with coshes intercep-
ted the guards from the
Security Express van as
they were carrying the
money into the building.
After a short skirmish the
two attackers made off
with the loot.
It appears that they
had parked their car (a
blue Cortina of un-
defined type and age)
within the College pre-
cincts.
This makes it all the
more likely that some un-
suspecting members of the
staff or even a student
although this is unlikely
at 9.30!) saw something
suspect occurring.
Did you see two men
casually dressed in stock-
ing masks strolling out of
the back door of the
bank?
They would most likely
have been carrying a
rather heavy container
filled with money.
Stop Thief!
Did you see a rather
ordinary Cortina speeding
out of the Prince Consort
Road exit as though they
had planted a bomb in
College Block?
Have you see any stu-
dents with a Jensen Inter-
ceptor II recently?
Although you may have
dismissed such a sight as
the early morning light
playing tricks on your
eyes (assuming you had
them open) plea . .. se tell
the College Security
Officer (Mr. Dawson) if
you vaguely remember
something happening.
We have it on good
authority that a reward
is being offered for infor-
mation leading to the
arrest of the villains.
Your friendly Nat. West
Bank needs you.
This is
a good
question

John Lane was rati-
fied as President of
Imperial College Uni-
on at a meeting last
Thursday Lunchtime.
A Computing post-grad
standing on a Commu-
nist ticket, he is the first
political president we
have had for several
-.'years.- ... . ,., .. .
The poll was 30 votes
short of the required
minimum: 25 per cent of
the electorate must vote
for the poll to be consti-
tutional. In order to
make this election con-
stitutional, a Union Gen-
eral Meeting had to rati-
fy the election and the
College authorities must
approve.
The . Union meeting
called for Thursday
lunchtime was the least
publicised one of term,
no posters, bumph or
even ad in felix appear-
ing. However, quite a lot
of people came, mainly
at the instigation of the
candidates.
However the Secretary
(Martin Black) and De-
puty President (Paul
Jowitt) did not: they put
up a notice in the Great
Hall announcing the
cancellation of the meet-
ing before the time that
it was due to convene
and did not,come along
to check whether anyone
actually turned up. By
twenty past one, a meet-
ing of Imperial College
Students had been star-
ted under the chairman-
ship of Rosemary Par-
ker, President of RCSU
when along came the
ICU Executive to find a
good three hundred peo-
ple in the hall, and ac-
cordingly started a UGM
proper.
After agreeing to rati-
fy the election, even be-
fore the result was an-
nounced, various amend-
ments were passed and
defeated, and it was
deemed that the elected
President would become
Acting President if the
College Authorities did
not ratify his election.
The results were then,
announced: on the first
count John Lane got 424
votes, to Ian Farnell's
288, Adrian Smith's 83,
William Wood's 29 and
Pete Gillett's 24. It took
until the final count to
get John Lane past the
quota and it was peri-
lousy close. (Under the
Single Transferable Vote
system, there is a quota
figure which is the mini-
mum votes a candidate
must get in order to be
elected).
So amidst much cheer-
ing and clapping, John
Lane was announced
President, pending offi-
cial recognition. The
meeting went on to vote
on a motion put forward
by Sonia Hochfelder
which censured the Sec-
retary for cancelling the
meeting before it even
started. This was passed
overwhelmingly, but a
call to Martin Black to
resign was equally over-
whelmingly defeated.
An Extraordinary
General Meeting of the
Union is to be held to-
day at 1 p.m. in the
Great Hall to discuss the
question of the Presi-
dency and everything
else that should have
been discussed last
Thursday had there only
been time . .
