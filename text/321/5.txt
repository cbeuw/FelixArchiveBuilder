Another NUS conference has come and gone. What
has it achieved?
How many of the decisions at it are likely to affect
you, the people in whose name it was justified? The
conference lasts for four days during which time about
35 hours of debates take place. Obviously, someone,
somewhere, thinks it of great importance that this
should occur. Hopefully, this article will help you to
understand more about NUS and its relevance (or not)
to most students.
As indicated last week,
the main business of the
c o n f e r e n c e revolves
around the debating of
these motions which have
received the highest "pri-
oritisation". This year the
top five items to be dis-
cussed were Representa-
tion, Housing, Conference
Reform. Grants and Aut-
onomy. These took up
most of the time available
but such things as Execu-
tive Reports, Finance Re-
ports and Elections take
place too. An Executive
Report is a summary of
what the Union Exec has
achieved during the period
between conferences. Fin-
ances are discussed during
a "closed session", that is,
one from which all press
and visitors are excluded.
Elections are held for
posts that fall vacant due
to resignation or expira-
tion of term of office.
The most important
part of conference is defi-
nitely the production of a
motion duly amended and
passed by the delegates
which is then used by the
executive as an indication
of the line it has to pursue
during the next six
months.
The dominant theme in
all these debates is a fight
between the Executive
(mostly Communist Party
members) and the extreme
left groups on the confer-
ence floor (International
Marxist Group and Inter-
national Socialists). The
ludicrous state of affairs
leads to the situation in
which the Executive is
given the appearance of
an almost reactionary
group. Undoubtedly this
is one of the major weak-
nesses with the NUS as it
stands. The conference
debates are normally so
bogged down in ultra-left
wing amendments that the
main motion is almost for-
gotten by the time it
comes to voting on it. By
this time most of the dele-
gates have lost track of
what is happening and so
the motion is always
passed. Hence a Commun-
ist Party line on student
politics is invariably the
result.
In the Representation
debate for example, Sur-
rey University had includ-
ed an amendment which
rejected representation as
a "Sop to the students".
Their position was that
any form of representa-
tion weakened the stud-
ents' position in that they
could never affect the
workings of the committee
they were on since they
were always in the minor-
ity. Along with this nega-
tive position came the
statement that "It is time
students realised which
side of the class barrier
they are on". This amend-
ment was eventually de-
feated but not before
three quarters of an hour
of debating had taken
place. This was only one
of four amendments and
at the end the amended
motion was thankfully dis-
posed of. In it was includ-
ed some strong lines on
what would be acceptable
to NUS but little thought
was given to the students
who might be called to
implement a strike or sim-
ilar action.
Again and again this
lack of consideration for
the 500,000 students which
NUS claim to represent
was evident. The naive ex-
cuse that the ordinary
students are represented
by their delegates is not
good enough. Theoretic-
ally, all delegates should
have a mandate from their
own unions on all topics
of debate, but this is tot-
ally impracticable. Too
much work has to be done
by individual union mem-
bers for comprehensive
mandates to appear. In
the case of our own
Union the deficiencies are
seen only too clearly. The
main motions had to be
submitted before the be-
ginning of the Christmas
term so that the compli-
cated procedure of priorit-
isation and returning
amendments can be com-
pleted in time. This limits
all the decisions to, at
most, the External Affairs
Committee and normally
just the External Affairs
Officer. Inquorate Union
meetings resulted in all the
amendments being un-
approved and the dele-
gates being virtually un-
niandated.
Under these circum-
stances the correct action
for the delegates would be
to abstain from all votes.
This is clearly absurd and
indicates the need for
some basic thought on the
matter.
As far as I can see there
is no solution. The nearest
oomparable situation is
that of the Government of
the country. No attempt is
made to mandate an MP
and it is accepted that this
is the only way the sys-
tem could work. It is
assumed that MPs have
sufficient expertise and
concern for their constitu-
ents that they will vote for
them where they can.
However, on most.issues,
of national importance,
the MP invariably votes
on conscience, the debate
over Common Market en-
try being a good example.
Although some people
would disagree (mostly
those who go to NUS con-
ferences!) the system has
and is still working well.
Where, therefore, is the
difference between this
and the NUS which is not
working at all well?
The crucial item is that
of interest. People are in-
terested in who governs
the country. They know
that a government has im-
mense powers and that
these can be used to affect
their lives. Hence when
the time comes for an MP
to be elected he has to be
easily identifiable with a
group which has certain
defined responses to run-
ning the country. MPs are
very rarely chosen by
personality, they are chos-
en by the party they be-
long to. This selection
process eliminates radical
elements automatically.
The whole system is
founded on the fact that
MPs have to believe in the
process of Parliamentary
control of the country
otherwise they are not
selected as . an "official
candidate".
However, the NUS is
not in such a position.
The people who are elig-
ible to vote for delegates
or stand as one are not
convinced that the NUS
has any power to affect
their lives. Therefore,
when the time comes to
elect the delegates, , the
vast majority do not care
who is chosen. This allows
the small percentage of
activists to dominate the
proceedings. Hence when
the NUS claims to repre-
sent 500,000 people, no-
one listens.
This sad state of affairs
is self-perpetuating. As
long as most students are
not interested, the govern-
ment will recognise that
NUS has a minimal
amount of bargaining
power and act according-
ly. This reinforces the
students' view that the
NUS cannot affect their
lives and so the circle is
closed.
This is an inevitable
consequence of the fact
that students are not de-
pendent on the NUS to
provide their jobs and sec-
urity as is the case with
Trade Unions. Even as-
suming that the NUS
could cause a national stu-
dent strike, no-one would
suffer as a result of it.
However, if the TUC de-
cides to call a general
strike, the country grinds
to a halt. Obviously the
fact that society is immed-
iately dependent on work-
ers gives them a power
which NUS can never
have.
It is therefore impos-
sible for the NUS to have
any serious affect on any
one. This removes the
main reason for its exist-
ence as a union, and cer-
tainly brings up the
question of belonging to
it.
Imperial College Union
pays several thousand
pounds for the dubious
privilege of belonging to
it. If the NUS could actu-
ally affect the government
in any significant way (no,
I do not include the "with-
drawal" of the DES Green
Paper on Union Auton-
omy) then this might be
worth the money. The
fringe benefits such as
cheap travel, insurance,
etc., are of use only to the
individual, and do not jus-
tify the whole union be-
longing.
' It is therefore, with a
heavy heart, that I recom-
mend serious considera-
tion by the Union of
discontinuing our mem-
bership of NUS.

CONFERENCE
THALIDOMIDE
A total boycott on products
of Distillers' Company Ltd.,
the company that marketed
the drug Disteval (commonly
known as Thalidomide) be-
tween 1
9
5
9 and 1
9
6
1 was
caled for. Distillers' main
products on sale in Unions
are their spirits: they ac-
count for more than 9
0
% of
whiskies and a large number
of other spirits. Common
brand names are Black and
White, Johnnie Walker, Gor-
dons, etc. DCL also make
most yeast used in Britain,
market a considerable num-
ber of pharmaceuticals, and
have large interests in a num-
ber of breweries.
Conference also called for
the nationalisation of the
pharmaceuticals industry and
for Distillers ito pay suitable
compensation to the victims.
GRANTS
A major grants campaign
is to be launched in the N
e
w
Year. C.O.'s and the NUS Ex-
ecutive aim to mobilise the
entire student body behind
their demands for an imme-
diate grants rise, an annual
review of grants in line with
a student cost index, the abo-
lition of discretionary awards
and ithe means test, a better
post-graduate grants system,
and 1/30 of the full grant for
each w
e
e
k over the 30th spent
working.
Major springboard of the
grants campaign will be a
national rent strike in Janu-
ary to make hall fees and/or
catering prices compatible
with the national element al-
lowed for them in the grant.
(They already are a
'
t Impe-
rial and all London collegest,
but living in the provinces,
it appears, is much more ex-
pensive! !).
HOUSING
Reiterating the demand for
a national rent strike until
hall fees fall in line with ithe
national element in the grant.
Conference also called for the
abolition of the -'self-balanc-
ing" system for halls imposed
by the University Grants
Committee (UGC) and the
Local Education Authorities,
suggesting that halls be sub-
sidised. The motion also said
that no more "totally inappro-
priate" halls should be built,
but purposeJ
built student
flats should be provided in-
stead. Deviating slightly,
Felix will (
be publishing a
novel solution to 'the student
housing problem — which
imll work — in the series
"Felix Financially" next
week.
REPRESENTATION
Conference overwhelmingly
defeated an amendment to
the substantive motion call-
ing for the ending of student
representation in the govern-
ment of Higher Education,
tabled by Surrey University.
This amendment said that,
since students have not got
an equal say on committees,
they cannot influence the de-
cisions of these committees
and are implicated in the
decisions of them whether
they agree or not.
The substantive, which
was equally overwhelmingly
carried, called for maximum
student representation on all
college committees, and for
the abolition of Privy Coun-
cil "Reserved areas". It also
stressed that student repre-
sentatives should be elected
from and by the Union floor,
something which does not al-
w
a
y
s happen. "There should
be the maximum democratic
control of students union
representatives," it said.
WOMEN
Certainly the best report
compiled by the NUS Execu-
tive for years, "
W
o
m
e
n in
Society", the work of the only
women on the NUS Exec, Was
presented ito Conference.
Conference condemned the
discrimination aganist women
and all other oppressed sec-
tors of society, especially
homosexuals.
STIRLING
"Conference believes that
(Digby Jacks') remarks
clearly represent a stab in the
back directed at a group of
students already under
heavy attack from the bour-
geois mass media; and we
note the giee with which they
have been received in this
quarter". It was thus that
conference censured the NUS
president for his opening re-
marks at conference. Con-
ference pledged its full sup-
port .to the victimised Stu-
dents at Stirling, and to the
right of Stirling students .to
demonstrate against the "
e
x
-
travagant and unnecessary"
visit of the Queen to Stirling.
CONFERENCE
REFORM
Extensions . of time had to
be granted several times to
get this set of motions, more
than 20 of them, through con-
ference. Even so, not alt
of them were debated. This
debate s
a
w Imperial dele-
gates at their most vocife-
rous, especially on the powers
of steering committee who,
as you m
a
y remember from
an article in "Felix" a couple
of weeks back, are the ones
w
h
o really run the show. IC
were Instrumental in prevent-
ing several extensions of
power to Steering Committee
getting through. No one is
looking forward more than
the student press to finding
out whether the n
e
w proce-
dures will make conference
more comprehensible!
STUDENT
NURSES
Conference condemned the
abyssmal pay of student
nurses, and the appalling
conditions they were required
to work under. They are, .
it was claimed, treated as
menials at work and subject
to oppressive and archaic sys-
s
e
m
s of hostel accommoda-
tion. Conference urged that
they be brought as members
into the NUS, and that the
NUS immediately starts cam-
paigning on their behalf.
AUTONOMY
Under its favourite Chair-
man (and the only competent
one), Ed Straw, Conference
ploughed through the sub-
stative motion and. seven of
the ten amendments (defeat-
ing all the amendments ex-
cept for a small instruction
calling for a national cam-
paign on Autonomy) in two
hours — quite an achieve-
ment in terms of time. The
remaining substantive, which
was carried overwhelmingly,
contained instructions to the
Executive should the govern-
ment suddenly re-introduce
its plans for SU's. In the
meantime, it condemned the
freezing of Union funds by
College Authorities. It also
called upon the Executive to
initiate a campaign against
staff treasurers of unions,
and upon C.O.'s to remove
them where they exist. (This
is the case in Imperial).
