IIS TO THE EDITOR
LETTE
Jews,
Jowitt,
and
Jeneralisation
Sir,
From Paul Jowitt's com-
ments on my article in CEFE
No. 6 concerning Israel and
the letter bombs, it is quite
obvious that he has not
actually bothered to read
properly what was stated
there but has simply taken
a totally biased point of
view.
I clearly stated six points
of fact which indicated that
Israeli intelligence was im-
plicated in the recent letter
bombs campaign. Paul Jow-
itt goes so far as to admit
the truth of the facts, yet
then says that surely the
Israeli government couldn't
have done anything quite so
nasty and unscrupulous.
What sort of logic is this?
It is most unscientific, illogi-
cal and totally biased to
accept all the evidence and
then say but anyway it just
can't be so".
In any case the Israeli gov-
ernment has shown frequent-
ly in the past that it is nasty
and unscrupulous and will
even murder Jews simply to
make propaganda. During the
1950's Israeli intelligence
operators were sent to Arab
countries to set off explo-
sions in Jewish shops and
synagogues to arouse Jewish
fears and encourage tension
between Jews and Arabs,
and to increase the desper-
ately-needed Jewish immi-
gration to Israel. The vic-
tims, of course, were the
Jews living in the Arab
states such as Iraq and
Morocco.
The Israelis have particu-
larly used the letter bomb
in their terrorist campaigns.
In May. 1948, 25 years old
Rex Farran, student brother
of a British Army officer in
Palestine, was killed when
he opened a parcel bomb
addressed to his brother.
Earlier, on September 3rd,
1947, a letter bomb ad-
dressed to a Brigadier in
Intelligence at the War Office
exploded in a GPO sorting
office in south-west London.
Irgun Zvai Leumi and the
Stern Gang were the suspect-
ed culprits at the time.
Eight letters posted in
Turin to prominent British
politicians and senior Army
officers were also intercept-
ed. Intended recipients in-
cluded Arthur Greenwood,
Minister without Portfolio,
Sir Stafford Cripps, John
Strachey, and Major-General
Edward Spears, former min-
ister to Lebanon and Syria.
A parcel-bomb also arrived
at the home of General Sir
Evelyn Barker, former Officer
commanding in Palestine.
Israel later renewed its
parcel-bomb war. The Sun-
day Times notes: "In 1963
they (the Israelis) mounted
a short campaign against
West German scientists
working on rocket and mis-
sile projects in Egypt.
"It was very successful.
Four Egyptian technicians
died when a scientific man-
ual addressed to their Ger-
man superior exploded in
their office. The secretary of
another German rocket scien-
tist working in Egypt was
blinded when a parcel, sent
from Hamburg, exploded as
she opened it. A parcel sent
from Stuttgart failed to ex-
plode".
Paul Jowitt then accuses
me of saying thai it was the
Israeli government who was
also involved in the various
hijackings and the Munich
massacre of Israeli athletes.
Nowhere in my article did I
state any such thing. On the
contrary; I quote, "Whatever
Western Public Opinion
thinks about incidents such
as hijacking or Munich the
Palestinians at least have the
honesty to accept responsi-
bility . . .". / would be in-
terested in an explanation of
how this amounts to accusing
the Israeli government of
these acts. On the letter
bomb campaign, responsibil-
ity by the various Palestinian
organisations has specifically
been denied.
Nor did I anywhere state
that the gassing of Jews in
Germany by the Nazis was a
propaganda exercise. I abso-
lutely condemn the brutal
acts of the Nazis against the
Jews or anyone else, how-
ever, I equally condemn simi-
lar acts committed by others
including the Israeli govern-
ment. The daily acts of
terrorism carried out by the
Israeli army against the Arab
people in Israel and the
neighbouring countries, the
burning of Arab homes, des-
truction of villages in South
Lebanon and Syria, the
bombing of refugee camps
with napalm and splinter
bombs may not be so well
publicised as the Nazi gas
chambers but the Nazis and
their sympathisers too tried
to hide their existence for as
long as possible.
Where in my article Paul
Jowitt found any mention
whatsover of the persecution
of Jews in the Bible I do not
know; perhaps he could
point this out to me.
Paul Jowitt's statement
that "the population of
Israel is 100 per cent behind
the Israeli government's atti-
tudes towards the surround-
ing Arab countries" is firstly
completely unsubstantiated,
secondly illogical — nowhere
is there 100 per cent sup-
port for any similar issue—,
thirdly, disputable from a
factual basis. I would advise
Paul Jowitt to read (without
turning every sentence
around to say the opposite)
the book "The Deceived Tes-
tify" by Ghenrikh Gafman,
which gives actual examples
of what the people of Israel
really think.
Zionism is in fact not in
the interest of the Jewish
people. The aim of Zionism,
which began in the last cen-
tury as a reaction to European
antisemitism, was to gather
all the Jews together in Pal-
estine — the Chosen People
in the Promised Land. This
is a defeatist and escapist
solution which never gained
much support among Jews so
that even today 90 per cent
of Jews still live outside
Israel. It did however win
support from countries with
an interest in the oil resour-
ces of the area.
Zionism's first success was
when Balfour declared offi-
cial British Government sup-
port for it in 1917.
Subsequently the British
mandate over Palestine
opened the door to the refu-
gees from Nazi persecution.
When the numbers had
swollen sufficiently, a short
sharp military campaign es-
tablished the state of Israel
in 1948. The Palestinians,
who had lived in Palestine
for 1,500 years, were driven
out by Zionist terror (the
massacre of Deir Yassin, in
which the total population of
a village, men, women, and
children were murdered and
thrown down a well, will
rank forever in the annals of
barbarity).
As for the borders, the
Israeli State has continually
tried to expand itself. The
state established in 1948 was
larger than the United Na-
tions Plan for a Jewish State
in 1947. Even now after the
huge expansion of 1967,
Israel is still trying to extend
its borders into Syria and
Lebanon. The so-called
"genocide threat" is just a
pretext for expansion. Most
of the Palestinian groups
have as their aim to estab-
lish a non sectarian state of
Palestine with Jews and
Arabs living together. It is
the Israeli government which
is being unreasonable by in-
sisting on a totally Jewish
state where a few Arabs are
permitted provided they fore-
go most of their rights.
As for Paul Jowitt's five
closing paragraphs, they are
quite unrelated to the ques-
tion. I suspect that he is on
an ego trip and is trying to
show off some knowledge of
ancient history.
Finally, Paul Jowitt's
whole letter is based on his
assumption that I support
the Black September move-
ment. I nowhere said this or
implied this in any way (even
Pete Giliett'was capable of
pointing this out to me at
the time). I do not in fact
support this organisation as
I believe that terrorism gets
one nowhere and is in fact
harmful to the Palestinian
cause. I was merely giving
evidence that this organis-
ation was not in fact respon-
sible for one particular act
(i.e. letter bombs) which
has generally been blamed
on them.
I would repeat the Felix
editor's footnote to a differ-
ent article by Paul Jowitt in
the same issue — "Next
time, please Paul, read the
article before criticising it. i
think, to quote you, 'you got
it wrong'."
Yours sincerely,
SONIA HOCHFELDER.
Foot Speaks
Sir,
After nearly a term now
of 'closed-shop" union activi-
ties, I hope that this letter
will help to improve the qual-
ity of our representation
committees.
Very often, the Union has
representation where many
people do not realise (did
you know there is a comput-
ing services committee?).
Furthermore the people who
get elected (usually by
Council) to such committees
tend to communicate very
little to the Union as a
whole.
In some areas—e.g. Aca-
demic Affairs,—people get to
know their reps fairly quick-
ly — good.
But judging from the num-
ber of letters to Felix on
refectories, it appears that
few students realise we have
a refectory committee —- let
alone who we have elected
to it.
One of the main purposes
of floor reps — yes, they do
have a purpose! — despite
two columns on the front
page of Felix two weeks
back telling you to the con-
trary — thus preventing any
mention of the fact it was
Rag Week on the front page
of Felix (honest! — it was
Rag Week!) — as I was say-
ing, one of the main pur-
poses of floor reps is to help
you find out who your reps
are on any particular com-
mittee and to badger them
on your behalf if you wish,
or even, if necessary, call
for their resignation.
Furthermore they can re-
present you at joint council
and . help elect the council
members you would like to
see on Bookshop Committee,
Bar committee, etc.
It is a pity I have left it so
long telling you what my job
is, when my job is telling
you what jobs other people
do.
Yours, etc.,
G. W. FOOT,
Maths 3, ICU Floor
Rep on Council.
Foot Speaks
Again
Sir,
I must confess I have
never seen a waste of
£1,00 as ICU is wasting
on its two sabbatical officers
this year.
Our Secretary (not Hon.
Sec. — we pay him you
know) spends all his time on
committees which ordinary
members of the Union can
do — and his spare time do-
ing other peoples jobs and
leaves his work unfinished.
1) The minutes of the pre-
vious Council meeting, and
the reports to be presented
to council, arrived in coun-
cil's letter rack the morning
before the meeting.
2) The minutes of the last
Union meeting were, as ever,
unpublished before the
meeting.
3) He was late to that
meeting.
4) He could not organise
anything so simple has hav-
ing two people on each bal-
lot box for the last election.
Regardless of how much
work he does, if he deprives
us of valuable minutes, re-
ports, etc., we can make no
contribution whatsoever, and
the Union becomes a one
man show (Yes, a show).
Our other sabbatical offi-
cer spends his time editing
a newspaper he is too lazy
to distribute around I.C.
(Sennet) and leaves Felix to
his spare time.
He makes the task of
editing Felix easy, by serial-
ising books in a Daily Mirror
manner, having a large area
devoted to sports and re-
views (he doesn't have to do
any work on these pages)
and padding out the letters
with sarcastic comments
(why should he be the only
one in the Union who can
get his own back?).
After he has written large,
well - spaced - out articles,
with big boxes saying 'Per-
sonal viewpoint of Oliver
Dowson' in the middle, there
is just a tiny space left, usu-
ally on page 2, for some real
news.
We wanted a secretary and
an editor of Felix and we
made them sabbatical so as
to give them plenty of time
to chase up other people —
but they do the 'job" or
something approximating to
it, on their own and make a
right mess of it.
Hoping for a return to the
days of Sugden's Daily
Mirror . . . .
G. W. FOOT,
Maths 3.
Foot-note
/ am afraid that I cannot
help but reply to Mr. Foot's
two letters. In his first, he
shows that he has no know-
ledge whatever of what a
floor rep is meant to do —
surely to represent the floor
of the Union? I sent a Felix
reporter to stop passers-by on
the walkway and ask them
what they knew about floor
reps. Most of them had never
heard of them . . . even fewer
had heard of Mr. Foot, and
few of them knew he was
one. "People who get elected
to these committees tend to
communicate very little to
the Union as a whole" he
says. I look forward to the
day when he communicates
to the Union Floor what
he is doing in their
name, and makes them
know that he is their
representative. I haven't had
any letters on refectories this
term. What's the good of
someone who only tells you
what other people are meant
to do and does nothing him-
self, please ?
As regards the comments
about myself in the second
letter, it would be nice if Mr.
Foot got some facts right. I
spend little if any time on
"Sennet" — a mere four
hours every other week. I
am no longer Editor of that
paper. I do have to work on
sports and reviews pages —
/ have to make them literate,
a task which really needed
doing on both your letters, es-
pecially the first one which
wouldn't get past the 11 -plus.
I also have to type out all the
articles, and lay them out on
the page. Any news that
there is — and there isn't
much — gets on page 1, un-
less technicalities force it to
appear elsewhere. If you want
to know what the job of edit-
ing Felix is like, and what I
do, I suggest you follow me
around for a week and find
out. But get some sleep first,
because you won't get much
on the job. If your job is tel-
ling other people what jobs
other people do, find out
what the jobs involve first
. . . now I wonder what a
floor rep is meant to do . . .
More on
Lager
Sir, — / must thank Rich-
ard King for pointing out the
finer points of Carlsberg I
Watneys marketing tech-
nique.
I did know that the "Gold-
en Mermaid" Carlsberg was
an important but, as Richard
King rightly explained, it is
virtually unobtainable in Lon-
don and my accounting for
the difference would have in-
volved a disproportionate
amount of space in the
article.
Incidentally, Bass, Char-
rington last week declared a
profit of £48.9 millions, an
increase of 24 per cent over
the previous trading year.
Turnover, however, only in-
creased by 14.4 per cent . . .
Yours affectionately,

Livestock
Export
Concern
Sir,
May I, through the cour-
tesy of your paper, draw the
attention of students and
staff to the RSPCA CAM-
PAIGN TO STOP THE
EXPORT OF LIVE FOOD
ANIMALS, which follows a
report by their Chief Veter-
inary Officer on the appalling
conditions our livestock are
exposed to during and after
export. Britain joins the
Common Market on 1st Jan-
uary, 1973, and while it will
not be possible to get the
necessary legislation through
Parliament before then, it is
the intention of the above
Society to continue to put
pressure on the Government
to pass a law prohibiting the
export of food animals to
countries (several of which
are in the EEC) which are
not using humane killing
methods in their abattoirs.
It is quite clear from recent
investigations that the old
Balfour "Assurances"
(1957) are no longer suffi-
cient to protect these ani-
mals and many of the foreign
abattoirs are being allowed
to slaughter our livestock in
conditions which would not
be tolerated in any of our
abattoirs. If old laws, to
which some of these coun-
tries are signatories, are be-
ing ignored at will, it is
imperative that our Govern-
ment realises this and guts
a stop once and for all to
this despicable treatment of
our British-reared livestock.
For many reasons a carcase-
only trade must be substitu-
ted, and these reasons are
clearly outlined in an excel-
lent leaflet produced by the
RSPCA which also contains
a report by their Chief
Veterinary Officer. I strongly
recommend that your readers
see this. The facts are pre-
sented in a non-emotional
way and quite apart from
this human angle there are
cost implications for the
British Taxpayer which every-
one ought to know about.
Supplies of this leaflet may
be obtained from me on ring-
ing Int. 2593 or direct from
the RSPCA, 105 Jermyn
Street, London SW1.
I appeal to everyone inter-
ested to please get in touch
with me with a view to
signing a petition in support
of the campaign or if pre-
ferred they may write direct
to the RSPCA. All letters,
petitions, etc., will be taken
to the House of Commons
before the end of December
by the Vice-Chairman of the
RSPCA who is also an MP
and presented in support of a
Bill which it is hoped will
be quickly passed through
Parliament. There is a very
strong feeling, I am told, in
the Commons about this
campaign and more and
more MPs (over 200 to date)
are signing motions to put
pressure on the Government
to end this needless suffer-
ing.
The RSPCA needs YOUR
support. This is not an ap-
peal for money, only for
signatures. Will you please
help?
Yours faithfully,
SHEILA D. STUART,
College Block.
Union
v.
Parker
Resolved
Sir,
May I express my appre-
ciation to you and to the
many students who support-
ed me during my dispute
with certain members of the
I.C.S.U. This dispute arose
mainly through a misunder-
standing on both sides and
a vast exaggeration of the
contents of the letter by a
member of Management. I
am pleased to say that the
dispute has been resolved
amicably and that the pre-
vious good relationship has
been restored.
Thanking you all once
again.
Yours sincerely,
RON PARKER,
Messenger, Beit Hail.
Felix
Minuted?
Sir,
We suggest that the Hon.
Sec. of I.C.U. publish the
minutes of I.C. Union meet-
ings in Felix. This would
provide an excellent oppor-
tunity for the minutes to be
read before they are taken
as read at subsequent meet-
ings. Why this is not done
at present is a mystery.
Yours, etc.,
M. BROADHEAD,
M. WITHERS,

DAD
Sir.,
As part of its general act-
ivity the College Branch of
ASTMS (Association of
Scientific, Technical B Man-
agerial Sta.'fs) is engaged in
PAD activity . . . where PAD
equals Participating Actively
in Democracy.
One type of PAD activity
is organising Political Affairs
Debates, bringing MPs to
open a debate on current pol-
icy points. Another type,,
which we would like to com-
mend to IC Students, refers
to local councils and this is
particularly relevant now be-
cause of the GLC elections
next May.
In this connection we are
attempting to formulate in
practical terms particular
policy points which we think
local councils can carry out
and then find one or more
councillors/potential council-
lors who think likewise. At
the same time we would like
to train/ organise a canvas-
sing team to support such a
friend(l) in the forthcoming
GLC election. If he/she is
elected, we would maintain
contact in order to see how
the policy points could actu-
ally be carried out.
At the moment we have
formulated a number of
general policy points under
the headings 'FREE PUBLIC
TRANSPORT / LAND UTIL-
ISATION/ COMPREHENSIVE
FREE FAMILY PLANNING
SERVICE / OCCUPATIONAL
HEALTH SERVICE/FORMA-
TION OF LIVING ART-
GRAPHIC SECTION OF
COUNCIL STAFF (to improve
ways and means of improv-
ing communications with the
public)'.
The next step is to pro-
duce short supporting docu-
ments which can then be
printed and circulated to
councillors / prospective
councillors /political parties
starting in the Kensington
area and extending it as far
as is practicable depending
upon the number of persons
who wish to 'participate act-
ively'.
Any student who would
like to participate in these
democratic activities can do
so by dropping a note to me
and they will then be kept
informed.
Yours sincerely,
H. FAIRBROTHER,
Secretary
Maths Dept.
