It suddenly occurred to me when I
was thinking about how to best use the
first third of an opinion page that Felix
had turned over to the RCS Broad-
sheet, that the publication that I am
privileged to edit is the only one of
ICs newspapers that is not distributed
free. So what better way to start than
to explain why this is so?
Apart from the obvious fact that
Broadsheet is the only one worth pay-
ing for (and we only charge the mere
pittance of lp) the main reason is that
charging is the only way to ensure it is
distributed properly and read by those
who are really interested. My job would
be a lot easier if we just dumped a
number of Broadsheets in each depart-
ment and left them to be picked up, but
by getting the social reps to sell them in
(heir departments we ensure that not
only every department has the opportun-
ity of buying a copy but also can keep
a check on how Well certain editions do
and which departments are keen to buy
it and which not. The fact that we
actually get some money back to help
cover costs (although it never can since
each copy costs over Ip in paper alone)
is really of secondary importance. Sales
in all departments, with the notable ex-
ception of Botany and Zoology (despite
persistent efforts of the social and de-
partmental reps) have been very
encouraging this term, reaching the
magic figure of 500 for all of RCS
Of course some copies are given free
and the few left over stored in the RCS
office where they may be purchased any
lunchtime (hint, hint!).
The purpose of Broadsheet is to in-
form and entertain the people of RCS
in matters concerning them directly and
also to cover some wider topics in the
interests of variety and completeness.
We have established this term a number
of regular features, namely a serious
crossword, literary serial "Boggin the
Bog", strip cartoon serial "Dart", hitting
comment column "Necromancer", and
Ents Page (of varying sizes), as well as
the usual news and reviews features,
editorial and presidential comments,
vice-column and (following hot on the
heels of last year's Martin's Bit) "John's
Bit" (who's she—Ed.). We also welcome,
and frequently get, articles from mem-
bers of RCS on all sorts of topics, some
humorous, others very serious. All
articles received, via the Physics letter-
rack addressed to me, or left in the
RCSU office, are considered for publica-
tion and inclusion depends on the
amount of space available.
Owing to the extreme difficulty (i.e.
virtual impossibility) of getting foolscap
paper at present, Broadsheet last week
became an all A4 edition for the first
time, complete with new front page
heading. Every edition now is usually
12 sides in length which means even
more hard work for the non-sabbatical
editor, comes out every other Thursday
morning.
Now that you all know about Broad-
sheet, next term I'll have other items of
national urgency and international
interest. Until then I'll leave you with a
little problem I mentioned a couple of
editorials ago. What sings Chinese
operas in the bath, dances on top of
Queen's Tower at full moon, but is read
all over?
Happy Crimble and a very new year,
RON (Appleby)
Broadsheet Editor.
THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM
Adam Hall (Fontana, 30p)
Exciting, frightening, true to life . . .
"'Quiller, British agent, lone-wolf living
close to the knowledge of his easy ex-
pendability sets out to upset a neo-Nazi
plot. Remorseless . . . a story that holds
you".—Evening Standard.
I think to a certain extent I agree, as
James Bond type-thrillers go. In fact,
this stands out as one of the best. The
Quiller Memorandum, or the Berlin
Memorandum as it was called when it
wasfirstpublished in 1965 has certainly
stood the test of time well.
I had never read this novel before,
yet it still maintained its grip of fear
over me. Written at a time when the
cold war was still in our minds and the
Berlin Wall had only just been com-
pleted, this must have been a really
devastating novel. I suppose that most
of the techniques used by our hero
Quiller are not used by the real-life
Rosenburgs, Vassals and Kimbys —
however, who am I to know. It all
seemed very realistic to me. I must ad-
mit that Quiller is pretty lucky with
some of the things he gets away with:
his reasoning doesn't exactly make him
the next Chomsky. Perhaps the most
annoying habit of Quiller's is to manage
to get out of his tight spots with the
absolute minimum of physical violence
but by the maximum of mental effort.
The story is very strong and holds
you to very nearly the end of the book
although 1 did find the end rather
scrappy and a little untidy. This may be
because trying tofinisha novel such as
this in an acceptable yet realistic way
is not particularly simple. Adam Hall
carries out a fine job and I think that
Fontana have made a wise decision on
reprinting, especially when you consider
some of the terrible novels released re-
cently.
This Will not probably make a very
good present, but buy it for yourself to
read over the boring Christmas after-
math.
Editorial
(continued from page 2)
develop films at all hours
of night to meet deadlines.
Any student newspaper
is only as good as these
people. And since these
people are students them-
selves, it is not unreason-
able to suppose that their
views can be identified
with by a number of the
readership, whatever the
views expressed. The over-
ajl aim is communication:
thus every student paper
should carry as wide a
range of views as possible.
No student paper can
afford to turn down good
contributions, whatever
the views expressed.
Anyone who gives up
time on a project for
which he gets no reward
other than to see his name
in print has a completely
justifiable pride in the
paper he has helped to
produce, especially in
those parts of it which he
has directly been respon-
sible for and which bear
his name. To have his
work altered or mutilated
in a way repugnant to him
does nothing but alienate
him from the Editor. Stu-
dent should not be set
above student, especially
not in the student press
world: as the ULU Hand-
book puts it, "People will-
ing to work on the student
press are gold dust and
treated with the same
love".
Regrettably this is not
always so. There are, so it
seems, still student news-
paper Editors around who
believe that everything in
their papers should be just
the way they like it — re-
gardless of what anyone
else thinks, let alone the
person or persons respon-
sible for the contribution
in the first place. These
editors call it "Editorial
Control" — their unfor-
tunate staff have other,
harsher, words for it. I
have just heard of a case
in a London student paper
where a correspondent
spent much of a day com-
piling information for
and writing a full-page
feature. The feature was
a serious one, and the cor-
respondent — needless to
say, after spending all that
time on it — was anxious
for the article to appear
as she wanted it to. But
the Editor decided to put
an entirely incongrous pic-
ture on the same page,
with a "funny" caption
which made it seem to
relate to the (dead seri-
ous) article. It reduced the
whole page to trivia. It
reduced the correspondent
to tears. She won't write
for that paper again, and
I can't blame her. That
paper has lost one of its
biggest contributors . . .
and in most student news-
papers, losing your least
contributor is a disaster.
The Editor didn't even
confer with her before
doing it. He won't budge
on the picture's going in.
It's a rather puerile atti-
tude.
As one of the few sec-
tors of the press not con-
trolled by the advertising
barons, the student press
should be showing the
way forward in catholic
journalism. There is no
place for autocracy in the
mental build-up of a stu-
dent newspaper editor.
Whether it is a question
of politics or one of
purely subjective likes and:
dislikes, no Editor should
ever impose his whims on
his staff of contributors.
There is an enormous
range of opinions held by
students: who is the Edi-
tor to decide which ones
should be voiced and
which not? There is a
limji to how far an Editor
can put himself above his
staff if he wishes to retain
the loyalty of both
them and the readers: it
is not a very high one.
Those who go above it do
their readers, their contri-
butors and the student
press in general a grave
disservice.
Of course this aim of
printing all shades of
opinion is somewhat Uto-
pian; it is only possible to
print what gets contri-
buted. Felix doesn't print
the articles some suggest
it should purely and
simply because no-one
contributes them, and
none of the existing Felix
staff are capable of writ-
ing them. (Their views
don't tally). If they were
contributed, they would
get printed, and no-one is
keener to see this happen
than me. So before those
of you who are critical of
Felix's politics (and there
are many of you, I know)
flood my pigeon holes
with angry letters, and my
ears with angrier sayings,
please sit down and write
an article for publication.
I don't know if anyone is
trying to suppress you or
your views, but I'm not
. . . and I won't guillotine
your article or trivialise it
either. You'd better guillo-
tine me if I do.

Phosphorous the Jobrot and Ferocious Din
I
(continued from page 6)
So Ferocious took the cloak and slung it
negligently around his shoulders. Nothing
happened.
"Put the hood up, mate", said Alt. Fero-
cious put the hood up:
"Bleeeeech!" said Phosphorous jumping
ten feet backwards. Instead of Ferocious"
usual angular features, there appeared be-
neath the hood a hideous skull-face, faintly
luminescent, with deep-set blood-shot eyes.
"Has something untoward occurred?"
asked the skull.
"Ferocious, you're horrible", said Phos-
phorous, trying to climb over the counter.
"Not bad", said Reg, "Pretty nasty isn't
it?"
"Do you mind", said the skull, "I've never
claimed to be handsome, but there is no
need to be rude".
"Take the hood off and you'll be back to
normal", said Reg. Ferocious lowered the
hood and beamed around.
"Not much difference really, is there?"
said Alf.
"Watch it, inventive sir", said Ferocious.
The intrepid duo were now fully equip-
ped, so they took their leave of Alf and Reg,
left the Adventure Stores, and set off along
the beach.
"What do you think we ought to do
now?" asked Phosphorous.
"Your guess, dear boy, is as good as
mine", replied Din, "I suppose we search
out this Twigworm character, and do some-
thing about his plight, so to speak". Just
where to search did not immediately occur
to the hardy adventurers, so they sat down
on the sand for a moment to think things
out.
Ferocious was just starting on a compre-
hensive recap of the situation as he saw it,
and Phosphorous was dropping off to sleep,
when the sand in front of them began to
tremble and vibrate.
"I say", said Ferocious, "can this be a
minor earth tremor, do you think, old fruit?"
But no, it apeared that something was bur-
rowing its way to the surface of the beach.
"Perhaps it is the Twigworm itself", said
Phosphorous, stepping back to avoid the
flying sand.
" A not dissimilar thought had crossed my
mind, old friend", said Ferocious. With a
final flurry of sand, a small sign on a pole
appeared, as if poked up by an invisible
hand from beneath. The sign was yellow-
painted, and in black letters it carried the
legend "TO THE TWIGWORM" with an
arrow pointing down the beach. In the bot-
tom left-hand corner were the letters " A . A . "
"That must be Adventurers Association",
guessed Phosphorous.
"Possibly', said Ferocious drily, "What
an organisation these people have, to be
sure. I would suggest, dear lad, that we fol-
low the sign, and see where it leads us".
"O.K." said Phosphorous. And they did.
Trudging along the interminable beach.
Ferocious mused on the problems inherent
in this adventure;
"You see, Phosphorous", he said, "this
being a TINY twigworm, I would surmise
that finding it in all this sand may prove
something of a, shall we say, problem".
Hardly had he spoken than the two rounded
a dune to be faced with a huge pile of old
tractor tyres.
"Oh, look at that", said Phosphorous,
"what a rotten thing to do, to dump a pile
of old rubbish like that on this nice beach".
"Dearie, dearie me", said the pile of old
tyres, "Oh woe is me", and burst into tears.
They had found the Twigworm.
