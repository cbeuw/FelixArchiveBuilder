Covent Garden at five in the morn-
ing i s not a particularly cheering sight,
yet this i s where the Mines Ball of 1959
really began. Flower bedecked Minesmen
returned to the Union with a view to
brightening the dance hall, and with the
aid of girl-friends, waste paper baskets
from the third floor and miscellaneous
helpers, the hall began to resemble
something like the wreckage after a
carnival instead of a ballroom.

(February 1 st to February 6th)
Since 1956, when the Exploration
Board was first formed, there have been
17 Imperial College Expeditions. From
the numerical point of view alone, this
is a considerable achievement.
To illustrate the work which has
been going on in this field, the
Exploration Board and Exploration Society
are sponsoring, jointly, an exhibition
of photographs, reports, instruments,
equipment etc. This will be held in
the third floor lounge of the Union dur-
ing next week (February 1 st to February
6th) and w i l l be open from 10.00 a.m.
each morning, except Monday, when i t w i l l
be opened by the Rector at 12.30.
A publication, 'A Review of Imperial
College Exploration' will also be on sale
in the Union during next week. This i s
a collection of general accounts of some
of last year's expeditions together with
items of more general interest. Price
1/-.
In oonjunotion with General
Studies, two lectures have been arranged
during the week. They are:-
'The Explorer in Africa'
By Dr. Hugh B.Cott, Director of the
University Museum of Zoology,
Cambridge. Tue. 2nd Feb., at
1.30 p.m., Concert Hall.
'The South Georgia Survey'
by Duncan Carse (ex Dick Barton),
broadcaster, writer and explorer.
Thu 4-th Feb., 1.30 p.m., Concert
Hall.
FELIX
By eight i n the evening, sherry
parties sprang t o l i f e i n many of the
hostel rooms, and by the timethese parties
had disgorged t h e i r contents into the
Union the B a l l was w e l l on i t s way. The
e a r l i e r chaos had changed into ordered
oalm and the decorations were a f i t t i n g
background to the occasion. Were these
tuxedoed gentlemen r e a l l y a l l Minesmen?
Not e n t i r e l y as some members of the other
Colleges were present. Indeed the usual
f i v e or so gate-crashers arrived; would
any Union function be possible without
them?
This, however, was no ordinary B a l l ,
f o r on t h i s night there was a Cocktail
Bar, a Beer bar and a Coffee bar from
which to purchase drinks. The l a t t e r
emporium was ably run by David and
Jonathan combine. Dancing of a l l types
was excellently catered f o r by the band.
Having seen the photographs of the B a l l
several persons have approached the Mines'
Hon. S e c with a view to receiving l e s s -
ons.
What other B a l l could offer a f u l l
meal with wine during the evening?
Mr. Mocney, apparently i n the Christmas
mood, provided an excellent meal i n the
middle refectory and the Minesmen rose t o
the occasion by consuming the complete
stock of some v a r i e t i e s of wine.
At one i n the morning the cabaret
appeared i n the disguise of Trevor
P o r r i t t , Noel Reams, Tom King, John
Loome and Andy Franklin with the i n v a l -
uable assistance of Ian Callow.
Forgotten words only added to our enjoy -
ment and t n i s excellent cabaret was
deservedly acclaimed. These persons
worked hard f o r our pleasure and to them
we would say thank you. At three,the
proceedings came to an o f f i c i a l close.
Flowers saw the end out even as i t saw
the beginning i n â€” Chrysanthemum
eating being the f i n a l act of t h i s great
show.
I f you saw the photographs of the
B a l l i n the Union you w i l l have r e a l i s e d
that we had a great time. "Excellent''
commented Ian H i l l , and surely t h i s is"
the opinion of a l l those who were there.
So Mines have firmly placed this occasion
on the social calendar as a must.
I t i s hoped that Union members w i l l
walk round the exhibition, buy the
journal, and support the lectures; and
that the popular misconception of exped-
i t i o n s as payed holidays w i l l , t o some
extent, be r e c t i f i e d .

Notes from the Suburban Country.
A horrid cold hibernating month
this. Not much to be seen on the
bird table except for a few bread
crusts, which can be seen just as
well in other months. The sparrows
are skating on the water bath in
about as big a f i x as a short-armed
trombone player, or a drummer with
Dermatitis on his skins.
Spore tracks can be found by
the diligent searcher in the snow.
The spore i s an uncommon animal,
occuring of course sporadically.
The prints of the spore are worthy
of mention, sinoe consecutive ones
always pointing in precisely opposite
directions. Three possible explan -
ations of this phenomenon have been
propagated. Either the animal has
one foot pointing backwards and one
forwards Charles Chaplin style
(Herniodactyl); or i t spins round
a l l the time; or is i t just plain
stupid. Sometimes specimens walk
on their hands (Pedodactyl), to save
the wear and tear on feet which are
then used as trafficators.
WHAT'S ON OUT Ai\D ABOUT
Just released at the Academy Cinema
i s a f i l m which may prove to be one of
the most astonishing exhibits of the oen-
tury. I t i s "The Boyar's F l a t " and
forms the second part of a t r i l o g y
dramatising the l i f e of "Ivan the
Terrible". I t was produced by Eisenstein
who i s almost certainly the greatest of
a l l Russian f i l m producers. F i r s t r e l -
eased i n 1946, i t was i n i t i a l l y censored
by S t a l i n .
The f i l m conveys the whole atmos-
phere of the times, the suspicion and
fear, the cruelty which Ivan i s forced
to use at moments of great national
danger. B r i l l i a n t l y using dramatic
"close-ups" and music by Prokofieff,
Eisenstein makes the f i l m move i n the
form of an opera. Apparently very
deliberate, yet conveying the whole speed
and tension of the situation. Every shot
every work and movement are designed ae
as to produce the exact state of mind
that he wanted. Cherkosov as Ivan i s a
magnificent figure, using his tremendously
powerful and adaptable voice to the f u l l ,
he produces at ease states of rage and
of p i t y .
The programme at the Academy i s
superbly balanced by the supporting f i l m
e n t i t l e d "Greek Sculpture". Directed by
B a s i l Wright and photographed i n Eastman
colour, i t i s one of the best films of
i t s type that I have ever had the pleasure
of watching. For once the commentarv
does not pander to the uninterested
audience, nor does i t make ostentatiously
d i f f i o u l t what they are trying to say.
R i c c i .
The Butterflies that were once
so pretty in the summer are now rot-
ting in the gutters and down the
drains. Snowdrops oan be found by
the keen Botanists (score 20 points)
and in some cases may be prolifio
enough to trample through. Time
for the bluebell desecrators of
early summer to put in a l i t t l e
praotioe.
Readers with an interest in
taxidermy should keep an eye on the
new motorway for specimens. A bird
in the bush i s worth two in the
hand
Meanwhile those who are tired
of January s i t down and wait for
February. It i s a terrible time of
the year.
