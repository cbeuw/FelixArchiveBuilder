On Tuesday 19th February a selection
of London College Presidents and some
ULU o f f i c i a l s were i n v i t e d to a party i n
Fleet Street by the E d i t o r of the Evening
Standard. With one or two exceptions
no one knew what the Evening Standard was
planning. The E d i t o r a r r i v e d a f t e r the
party was w e l l under way, and announced
that the Standard was going to publish a
weekly supplement concerning University
a f f a i r s . He considered that such a
great University should have i t s a f f a i r s
reported i n a National newspaper.
Those present, under the b e l i e f that
the a r t i c l e would be read by the whole of
London, were enthusiastic, and thought i t
an excellent idea. What seemed to be a
minor d i f f i c u l t y then arose; the day of
publication was to be Thursday. This
i s the day that P i , Beaver and Kings
News i s published and the Standard
agreed t o meet the Presidents of ULU,
IC, Kings, LSE, and UC to straighten out
such d i f f u l t i e s the following morning.
These f i v e Presidents decided to have a
quick meeting at Kings that evening t o
discuss what t h e i r attitude should be.
At t h i s meeting i t became clear that the
Standard had planned these a r t i c l e s
without reference to the President of ULU
or any other o f f i c i a l i n the f i r s t
instance, but had discussed i t with Mr.
J.Spellman, ULU President of Debates, who
had neglected to t e l l the ULU Executive.
They had however found out that something,
was afoot. Secondly the President of IC
had found ou"t that contrary to everyone's
b e l i e f the edition would not be on sal e
a l l over London, but only to students,
the Standard's idea being to s e l l i t i f
possible inside the various Unions.
Such a publication c l e a r l y threatened the
existence of Sennet. I t was decided t o
f i n d out from the Standard the following
morning:- i)What power d i d Spellman s t i l l
have. ii)Was i t only a l i m i t e d edition t o
students. i i i ) D i d they r e a l i s e that they
oould only s e l l i n the Unions with the
permission of the various Union
authorities.
After t h i s meeting they said that
they reserved the r i g h t to get informat-
ion from anyone they wanted, that they
would help us and we oould help them, but
that they would p r i n t exactly what they
saw f i t - and what they p r i n t e d was none
of our business. The edition was to be
a l i m i t e d one, five-thousand copies on
the f i r s t day with the hope that i t
would be increased i n future. They
hoped to s e l l i t i n the Colleges, with
our permission of course, by means of
student vendors whom they would pay.
Eventually they would t r y and s e l l i t
to the p u b l i c when and i f the public
showed any desire to buy i t . The
Presidents present agreed to go back
to the Standard on Monday 25th January
having consulted t h e i r executives and
having seen the f i r s t issue of the
paper.
The IC Executive have decided, i n
view of the fact that i t i s clear the
paper w i l l be only sold to students,
that i t has no value to the University.
Consequently i t has decided to refuse
to l e t i t be sold i n the Union, i f i t i s
sold outside the Union IC w i l l not
provide s e l l e r s , and f i n a l l y no o f f i c i a l
information concerning IC a f f a i r s w i l l
be given to the Standard. These d e c i s -
ions were made t e n t a t i v e l y to allow
room to f i t into any scheme that ULU and
the other Colleges had i n mind.
The President spoke to other London
Presidents informally on Saturday 23rd
January, and i t appears that other
Colleges share the IC viewpoint. The
ULU Executive f e e l i n the same way, and
intend now to f i n d out i f the Standard
w i l l come to an agreement about what
should be published and how and when.
Also they intend to f i n d out from
other newspapers i f they would object
to a suitable agreement between the
Standard and the University, f o r
c l e a r l y i f they would such an arrangem-
ent cannot occur. I t i s clear then at
the time of w r i t i n g (Sunday 24th Jan)
that the Colleges and ULU intend to put
forward a s o l i d front, and to show that
i t i s the students who count i n London
University and not what a National news-
paper cares to say or write about them.
In a l l i t lool.s as i f the Standard has
b i t t e n o f f more than i t can chew. A
oliche worthy of j t s own writers.

Very soon a campaign w i l l
be started to enrol Blood Donors
for a v i s i t to I.C. of the National
Blood Transfusion Service.
The H.B.T.S. i s a State financed
organisation r e l y i n g solely on the
voluntary support of members of the
society i t benefits. The State can
extort almost anything from the p r i -
vate c i t i z e n , but not yet his blood.
This does not mean that a supply of
blood i s unimportant. Over 800,000
bxood donationswere made i n the last year
and more are needed t h i s - surgery becomes
more universally e f f e c t i v e , road accidents
multiply, new uses are found f o r blood
transfusion every day - the demand f o r
blood r i s e s a l l the time.
This i s one good cause that nobody
can dispute and i n which a small e f f o r t
on your part may mean perhaps another
l i f e saved. The fact that i t i s a v o l -
untary service leaves the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y
for i t s success entirely i n your hands.
It w i l l be interesting to see how many
people at I.C. are prepared to do some,
thing f o r no material reward.
