FELIX
P R O F I L E
Mr. BREGAZZI. B.So. A.R.C.S.
GENTLEMAN OP THE TOWN OP MIDDLESBROUGH.
I t has often seemed strange to us,
that persons possessing the most m u l t i -
f a r i o u s talents, should be noted f o r one
of these talents only. And, Indeed i n
the oase of the gentleman we are today,
as the modern fashion i n English has i t ,
" p r o f i l i n g " , there i s no v i o l a t i o n of
t h i s general r u l e . Having come from the
murky depths of the i n d u s t r i a l North, he
at once gained a c e r t a i n fame as a player
of that incredibly d i f f i o u l t and dangerous
game, to wit, water polo. His prowess a t
t h i s sport was suoh that he was elected
to the oaptainoy of the Imperial College
Swimming Club. Meanwhile, however, he had
also been active i n the f i e l d of Rugby
Union F o o t b a l l , that game at which only
the strongest survive, and has now risen
to eminence i n this a t h l e t i c exercise.
I n f a s t he i s at the present time, t o *
Captain of the Imperial College Rugby
Union Club, a p o s i t i o n of much responsi-
b i l i t y , and from t h i s exalted spot, he
controls the fortune and destinies of
t h i s 3iost excellent of the athletio clubs1
of our establishment.
Having been questioned about his
vein on l i f e i n general, he was strangely
reticent, which i s most surprising i n view
of his extroverted and, i t might even be
said, ferocious play on the f i e l d . He
also refused to prognosticate on the
f i n a l outcome of the Gutteridge Cup
Competition, but one f e e l s this i s due
to natural modesty as he possesses a team
of alj. talents. His wonted a b i l i t y to
kick the spheroid long distances as was
notioeable i n that f i n e match against our
poorer neighbours, King's College, has
recently, so we have been informed, des-
erted him of late. But practice, as
the old aphorism has i t , makes perfect,
and practice he certainly has. We would
commend to you, then, t h i s estimable
person as worthy of notice and respeot
not merely as an a t h l e t i c personage
but a l s o as a research worker of consid-
erable acumen and v e r s a t i l i t y .

Clementine I I arrived quietly at
i t s new home a t 1.0 a.m. on a freezing
January night. This was not to avoid
losing the mascot on the f i r s t night but
the r e s u l t of a 150 mile tow by a l o r r y
only eight years younger than our vintage
machine.
The story began i n almost "Cops and
Robbers" fashion. While the d r i v e r and
navigator (Dick Howard and Ian Callow)
were discussing the influence of using
dried blood as manure on the flavour of
grapes with the head gardener at Shering-
ham H a l l , Clementine I I was seen d i s -

John Braine achieved suoh extreme
success with h i s opening best s e l l i n g
novel that his name beoame internationally
known. With t h i s fame came the problem
of a l l successful new w r i t e r s ; how to pro-
duce a further book without seemingly r e -
peating the f i r s t .
Ae f a r as I can see, t h i s problem
only ocours to the successful. The l e s s e r
known w r i t e r can repeat and develop h i s
ideas, bringing them forward from e a r l i e r
books with l i t t l e notice taken of the
r e p e t i t i o n ; whereas a best s e l l i n g w r i t e r
cannot a f f o r d to repeat anything i f he
wants to keep his high reputation.
The Author only p a r t i a l l y succeeds
i n t h i s , i n h i s latest novel THE VODI
(prioe 16/-).
The main, characters are indeed exact
opposites i n h i s two books, the f i r s t
being i n love with success while the sec-
ond dotes on f a i l u r e . But the secondary
characters seem to be much the same i n
both novels, each being set i n a small
Northern town on the moors. However, even
i f t h i s c r i t i c i s m i s not t o t a l l y v a l i d , as
obviously a w r i t e r can only write w i t h i n
his own experience, which i n thi3 case i s
a North Country Society, one expects rather
more v a r i a t i o n of theme than i s provided
here.
The book opens with the hero, Diok
Corvey, i n hospital s u f f e r i n g from con-
sumption. We are t o l d that he is slowly
dying because he has no w i l l to l i v e .
Then, by means of "flashbacks" i n Diok
Corvey's mind, John Braine t e l l s of the
unfortunate l i f e of his hero.
I t begins normally with neither
success nor f a i l u r e entering i t . Diok
and h i s best friend play a game while
they walk to school each day. I t i s a
atrange c h i l d i s h fantasy of "the Vodi",
an old obscene woman r u l i n g a group o f
l i t t l e men. The Vodi represents a i l that
i s v i c i o u s and e v i l oppressing good in
any form.
Dick grows up and the Vodi fades
from memory. He achieves r e l a t i v e success.
His father's shop prospers, he has a secure
family, money and a g i r l he i s going to
marry.
His s e c u r i t y i s broken when h i s
dies, and he contracts consumption. F i n -
a l l y his g i r l - f r i e n d gives him up. I t i s
then that h i s mind returns to thoughts o f
the Vodi. He becomes obsessed with the
idea. Wouldn't i t be wonderful to be a
magnificent f a i l u r e , not just to fade into
obscurity, but t o f a i l absolutely.
At t h i s point, when oomplete f a i l u r e
i s imminent he gets a strong desire f o r
one of h i s nurses. This desire brings
back h i s w i l l to l i v e and he decides t o
f i g h t his i l l n e s s .
The book closes on him leaving the
hospital and going out into the world again
to f i g h t f o r the love of the nurse.
This book, i f compared with the pre-
vious novel, i s c e r t a i n l y not s t r i k i n g .
I f , however, i t i s revised on i t s
own merits i t i s a good study of small
town l i f e . Dick Corvey's character i s
w e l l established though most of the others
remain somewhat weak.
On the whole, i t i s above the usual
Â»run of novels, but don't expect i t t o
rjsaoh the heights of "Room at the Top."
appearing at great pace over the brow of
a neighbouring h i l l . The mascot gone
without us! The owner of t h i s Stately
Home ordered his mechanic to rev up the
Phantom $ R o l l s Royce and with the s k i l l
of an experienced racing driver the chase
was on. Had they gone v i a Norwich o r
Fakenham. Just outside Holt we spotted
the curious t r a i n , a 1934 Ford l o r r y
towing a 1926 Morris Commercial l o r r y
(Clementine II) just taking a wrong
turn. Half a minute l a t e r and we should,
have missed them.
iVe had been able to run Clem. I I on
only 3 c y l i n d e r s and to save damaging the
engine further i t was decided to have
i t towed back to London. We had waited
2 days f o r our helping hand to arrive
and when he did turn up we were not on
the spot. Anxious to get back to London
he coupled up the two l o r r i e s and set
straight off without us.
The journey was uneventful except
that we got l o s t around the rocket sites
of East Anglia, the leading vehicle only
had side l i g h t s f o r half the .journey and
no braking l i g h t s or uraffic signals a t
a l l and one sporting woman d r i v e r t r i e d
to pass Between us at some t r a f f i c l i g h t s
and was brought to an abrupt halt by the
tow rope. We were so frozen i n the cab,
no aide windows, that we wore every
available scrap of clothing. On stopping
at a cafe i n Newmarket the woman immediately
looked the t i l l and c a l l e d f o r her husband.
The rest of the journey was continued
in dense fog but we were helped by a con-
voy of monstrous carrot l o r r i e s who trap-
ped U3 i n their midst and guided us to
London, In answer to many queries the
portable harmonium on the platform was
not used.
We hope that a f t e r a complete over-
haul and repaint Clementine I I w i l l be
on the road by March. According to the
H i s t o r i c a l Vehicles Club there i s only
one other such vehicle i n existence and
that i s not roadworthy. This 14.9 H.P.
Morris Commercial was found i n a Breakers
l a r d i n 1954 and r e b u i l t and restored t o
i t s o r i g i n a l condition. I t appeared i n
the f i r s t commercial vehicle R a l l y a t
Beaulieu i n 1957.
We hope to take the mascot on i t s
f i r s t o f f i c i a l t r i p to Camborne f o r the
B o t t l e Match.
