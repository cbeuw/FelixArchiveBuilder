Sir,
I would l i k e to bring to the notice
of the more aware members of the Union
the fact that the notice, containing
over 75 signature*, concerning a pro -
posed South African Society has been un -
o f f i c i a l l y removed from the notice board.
My feelings about this, dare I say
theft, are mixed. Visions of South A f r i -
can Wine Tasting evenings and perhaps the
odd J a f f a Orange Sucking evenings seem to
be fading with the removal of t h i s notice.
I t does, however, s t i r me into thinking
that perhaps a supporter of the South
African Boycott has raised himself from
his apathetic posterior and performed a
p r a c t i c a l deed i n the honour of his oause.
I f more such supporters were to follow
this S t i r l i n g example and do something
constructive they would r e a l i s e the r i d i -
culousness of this boycott.
C r i t i c i s m of Apartheid seems to me
to be u n j u s t i f i a b l e without better sugg -
estions f o r a solution of this problem.
Too many people are w i l l i n g to hurl abuse
and c r i t i c i s e things inside and outside
the Union without l i f t i n g a finger to
improve something that apparently needs
improvement.
Is t h i s Union to sink into the curr-
ent trend of becoming sick, siok, sick.
Yours etc., etc.
Paul L.Buet.

You're wrong again f o l k s , our
President i s not running away from i t a l l .
In fact there i s a very good reason f o r
his display of a t h l e t i c prowess.
As a r e s u l t of a bet, he stood t o win
a goodly sum of money f o r World Refugee
Year i f he could run round the Island
S i t e within s i x minutes. Our series
of action photographs represent h i s epic
sprint. During a practioe run Les A l i e n
had clocked 6 minutes 15 seconds, so when
he set o f f on the actual run excitement
was r t.gh. Sad to r e l a t e our benevolent-
av' ^.resident clocked 6 minutes 40
seconds and had to contribute 2/6d t o
those with whom he had taken the bet.
What the beneficiaries did with t h e i r
winnings i s not recorded.
The world of jazs as a whole, and
especially that part which i s t o be
found i n Imperial College, reoeived a
great honour when i t was revealed i n the
l a s t edition of F e l i x that Richard
Rushton had been awarded the Eugene
Q u i l l s Award (1960) for piano playing.
This great triumph has sparked o f f
considerable interest i n t h i s young music-
ian and I intend t o use t h i s week's
column i n committing some thoughts about
Richard Rushton, and the group he leads,
to paper.
John Richard Rushton was born i n
Wimsbey and l i k e a l l good Northern lads
his f i r s t musical experience was with the
l o c a l brass band. 0 Daddy, Rush blew
euphonium i n t h i s koo-ool o u t f i t , but i n
spite of t h i s the band h i t the tqps.
This v e r s a t i l e musician s t i l l l i k e s t o
r e c a l l these memories and i s always w i l l -
ing to pick up an o l d battered tuba and
blow the blues. And when this happens
- Man, look outi l i k e i t ' s B i r t h of
Cool.
I t i s said that Rush was b o m inside
a piano, but there i s some doubt as t o
the accuracy of t h i s fact, and even
Leonard Feather i n h i s Encyclopaedia
of Jazz i s non-commital However,
Man, Richard Rushton was digging the o l d
Masters at an early age, and very soon he
was blowing a swinging box. This boy
notched grade 42 i n h i s Eugene Q u i l l s
Academy examinations, when Bop struck;
l i k e - Powl He heard Charles Parker and
Bud Powell blowing up a storm on The
Yolce one night and that was i t . Like
I said Man - l i k e , Pow{
And so i t was l i k e Rush was at the
base of Bop ladder, and a f t e r several
years he has reached the top.
But don't think that t h i s cat's work
i s l i m i t e d to the confines of Bop.
Amongst h i s early idols were Jimmy Yancey,
Meade Lux Lewis, Count Basie and Cripple
Clarence Lofton. And so Daddy, into
those ten d i g i t s of JRR i s squeezed a
complete history of jazz, and out oomes
the s t y l e so personal and so f u l l o f soul.
Richard Rushton uses h i s technique i n the
manner of the late Art Tatum. I n the
hands of a lesser man i t would be expres-
sed as meaningless exhibitionism, but
here i t i s used t o explore the f u l l
p o t e n t i a l i t i e s of the piano, and t o trans-
l a t e an endless flow of ideas i n t o l o g i o -
a l improvisation.
Man, l i k e I d i g the blues
Especially when i t ' s cool.

The combo which Richard Rushton
leads i s completed by John Farnsworth
(bass) and Gordon Pritchard (drums).
John was b o m i n Hemsworth and during h i s
early days he blew a hot c l a s s i c a l box.
He reached the ultimate i n t h i s sphere
and then turned t o strings; he played
g u i t a r i n a Rock o u t f i t and blew a s o l i d
bass i n a S k i f f l e combo. He also bowed
' c e l l o f o r a while at t h i s time. Like,
you might say that t h i s boy's v e r s a t i l e .
Just to prove t h i s John now breathes
plenty plenty soul into a trombone. But
i t ' s that b i g f i d d l e Daddy-O. That mel-
odic walking l i n e that swings l i k e fury,
those bowed ensemble passages i n ballads,
those uppish solos executed with perfect
ease, those ideas that oould have come
from Oscar. Daddy, t h i s boy sets me on
f i r e . Like he swings , «hj*
Gordon P r i t c h a r d i s yet another
Northerner. Now t h i s boy's r e a l l y blue
-hot. His f i r s t tubs were made from
b i s c u i t t i n s and banjo vellums. On
these he practiced blowing skins; here
was a man dedicated to h i s work. And
now such i s h i s standard that he can
oomplete t h i s exciting t r i o . Dig that
stick-work man - every piano idea
competently answered with strokes o.
great nuance. Was that a mammy •daddy
boy? How skins and bass drive together.
When t h i s man blows brushes-then Man,
i t ' s l i k e t h i s combo has wheels.
Man, l i k e play me a
Ana make i t swing.

And so we have three great musicians
each understanding the other's musical
temperament p e r f e c t l y , playing together
as one e n t i t y , a l l dedicated t o t h e i r
a r t . Undoubtedly t h i s i s the greatest
o u t f i t 'Of t h i s type i n the Western Hemis-

At a Union Meeting on Thursday
Deoember 101 J -,-^nded by about 135 people,
Mines Union crushingly rejected I.C.Union's
decision t o impose a boycott on certain
South African goods i n the Union.
K. Warren Proposing "That this Union,
whilst not con'" n: Tg Apartheid should
dissociate i t i ' -rom the Iirperial College
Union.in the master of boycotting South
African Goods," f i r s t o u t l i r s d the con-
ditions under which the vot was taken a t
the I.C. meeting. According to him there
were only just over 200 people present out
of a possible 2500 and 50 of these were
dragged i n out of the corridors of R.C.S.
to make the meeting quarate.
Warren continued by pointing out
that the f i r s t person t o be affected by
an extensive boycott wouia be the African
native, the person we,-were endeavouring
to protect and that no boycotts had been
imposed on Hungarian and Chinese goods
a f t e r the bloodbaths of Hungary and Tibet.
He quoted the paradox of the Ghanaian
Government's boycott of South African
products u n t i l they found that 7 $
of t h e i r mining equipment came from that
area.
N. Seldon seconding, suggested that
a solution to the Apartheid problem would
come only from discussions a t government
l e v e l .
At the vote the above motion was
oarried amidst loud applause by 108
vote3 to 14 with 10 abstentions.
The other main business of the
meeting was the selection of a new mascot.
After some discussion i t was f i n a l l y
decided t o adopt a 1926 Morris Commercial
l o r r y .
