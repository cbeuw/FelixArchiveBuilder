The outstanding item of news i n the
Soooer Club at the moment i s the winning
of a Welsh International Cap by B a s i l
James, the University Skipper and IC Cup
stalwart. The Club, and I am sure the
whole College o f f e r t h e i r congratulations
and hopes that this i s the f i r s t of many
international honours to come h i s way.
Since the l a s t F e l i x report came
out, the Club tour to Germany has taken
place, and on the whole i t proved suo-
oessful i n every respect except one -
ask any member of the tour and he w i l l
give you h a l f a dozen reasons why we d i d
not manage to win a game. The r e a l
reason I suspect i s that the teams we
played were prestige sides f o r t h e i r
respective Universities, and included
some of the be3t student teams i n South-
ern Germany - hence the standard was very
high.
The t r a i n journey to CoLogne passed
unevjentfully, and having spent the night
there the party picked up two VW mini-
buses and drove down the Rhine Valley t o
Mannheim i n bright sunshine. Here we
were entertained royally during a two
day stay, i n spite of the threat of be-
ing chucked out of the hotel on the f i r s t
night. The match here was played on an
icy bone-hard p i t c h , and i n a snow storm,
the oold s p e l l i n Germany having just
started. IC made a bad start and were
3-0 down by h a l f time. A great second
h a l f r a l l y , however, took them to a 4-3
lead, only f o r Mannheim to equalise and
then scored the winner i n the dying
seconds of the game.
The following afternoon we drove
rather unsteadily through Heidelburg,
the Oxford of Germany, soon beguiled by
the vagueislightly off-hand charm of the
town whioh nestles i n a b e a u t i f u l
mountain setting with snow covered
heights on three sides. High up above
the town stood the famous Sohloss or
castle where even the hardiest IC
v i s i t o r s were taken aback by the giant
wine b a r r e l whioh holds 45,000 gallons
and has only been f i l l e d completely 3
times i n 300 veers.
IC f i e l d e d t h e i r weaker team against
Heidelburg thus making sure that every-
one had at least one game to remember -
and how we rememberedl In spite of a
bright sun the temperature was several
degrees below zero and the so c a l l e d
scratch Heidelburg XI included four
semi-professionals. Once again a f t e r a
bad s t a r t i n the f i r s t h a l f IC played
more i n t e l l i g e n t l y and more vigorously
l a t e r and held t h e i r s k i l l e d opponents
to a score of 4 - t .

Some people may have noticed the
peculiar buildings being erected i n
front of Weeks H a l l . These, f o r the
benefit of the l e s s well-informed, are
fives oounts, a g i f t from the Rector to
the Union.
These courts are only intended t o
be temporary, but may be with us f o r
three or four years. I t has been
decided to form a Fives Club as a sub-
section of the Squash Club u n t i l the new
olub can stand on i t s own feet.
The courts should be f i n i s h e d soon,
and i f anyone i s interested, they can
contact me through the Union rack or i n
my room, 62 Weeks H a l l . A l i s t w i l l
also be posted i n the Union. I hope
that the Union may also be persuaded to
provide equipment f o r those people who
ceased to play the game when they l e f t
school.

Reluctantly and with sliinmer wallets
we l e f t Heidelburg having tasted here
what was described as almost the best
beer i n the world and having completely
devastated a fine o l d student drinking
house c a l l e d SeppL with our tuneful ( i )
3inging. Outstanding was a song-and.
-dance routine e n t i t l e d "Green grow the
Rushes, Oh" which was enacted on the
table tops with such fervour that i t
almost l i t e r a l l y brought the house down.
The b r i s k e f f i c i e n c y of the technic-
a l University of Karlsruhe contrasted
strongly with the f a i r y t a l e atmosphere
of Heidelburg. The excellent meals and
the good accommodation situated i n a
splendid sports stadium complete with
grand-stand, indicated how w e l l organised
the Karlsruhe boys were from the sporting
point of view. This they further
demonstrated the following day when a
side including 2 dtudent internationals
and the Karlsruhe professional olub
reserve goal-keeper played extremely neat
simple f o o t b a l l to record a 5-0 win.
The IC team fought hard t o keep the score
to 1-0 at h a l f time but faded somewhat
in the second 45 minutes.
A night on the town meant that some
people arrived back ju3t i n time f o r an
early s t a r t to Cologne at 5 o'olook the
following morning. After a f l a t out
drive along the Autobahn one VW blew up,
about 10 kilometres from Cologne but
c a r r i e d on with just s u f f i c i e n t strength
to get us back to the garage.
After a quiok t r a i n journey we spent
the night i n Brussels, s t i l l resplendent
and l i v e l y from the 1958 E x h i b i t i o n , and
t r a v e l l e d back the following day to
London.
Thanks are due to our German hosts
who treated us so very w e l l and t o a l l
the tour party who aquitted themselves
admirably, and helped maintain IC's
excellent reputation abroad.
Lack of space prevents the i n c l u s i o n
of team reports and r e s u l t s i n t h i s
a r t i o l e , but i t i s hoped that a l l team
members w i l l oontinue the good work and
avidly read about t h e i r mighty and heroic
e f f o r t s i n the next issue.

Although the records may not appear
to be i n d i v i d u a l l y very good the club as
a whole i s comfortably on the c r e d i t side
and s e t t l i n g down to some good steady
dr inking.
Last Wednesday, Jan. 20th, the f i r s t
team played U.C. and l o s t 3-6. As there
appears to be a good chance of I.C. meet-
ing U.C. i n the F i n a l of the Gutteridge
Cup t h i s r e s u l t might cause alarm i n
certain quarters. I don't think however
that This alarm i3 j u s t i f i e d beoause I.C.
was beaten not by a b e t t e r team but by
i t s own lethargy. The following Saturday,
Jan. 23rd, saw I.C. i n completely different
mood i n a game i n which the team showed
complete mastery over a strong Harlequins
"A" teanv
I f i t is possible to pick out i n d i -
viduals i n such a f i n e display then
p a r t i c u l a r mention must be given to the
baok row trio of Fisk-Gllbert-Berger whioh
played outstandingly both i n attack and
defence.
Saturday 23rd Jan. must c e r t a i n l y
be set down as a memorable one for the
I.C. club for out of 3even teams s i x won
and one -drew, a feat which I believe has
been equalled on one other occasion but
never surpassed. The B 3 team brought
about a "near miracle" by beating Charlton
Park with 11 men. I t i s reported that
Baoyn3ki and Carter rampaged and Ludlam
scored a t r y only beoause he was faster
than everybody else.

I.C. WIN TROPHY
The f i r s t f i x t u r e of the term, a
matoh against London Hospital over our
home course at Petersham on Wed. 13th,
soon sorted out those members who had
kept up t h e i r t r a i n i n g during the
Christmas Vacation from those who had
been taking l i f e easy. Notable among
the l a t t e r were the Captain and the Vioe-
Captain. The match wa3 won, however, by
a wide margin, due no doubt t o the opp-
o s i t i o n being i n a s i m i l a r state of f i t -
ness. F i r s t three places were occupied
respectively by John Conway, Dave Hammonds,
find Pete Warren,
The t h i r d team disgraced i t s e l f on
Wed. 20th by l o s i n g to the Royal Veterinary
College second team at Petersham. F i r s t
three places were occupied by members of
the opposition. In fourth plaoe was Brian
B u t l e r followed by Roger Woolf (5).
Reading University and Sandhurst M i l i -
tary Academy provided weak opposition i n
a match held at Sandhurst on the following
Saturday. John Cleator, was f i r s t home f o r
I.C. followed by Pete Warren (4), Dave
Hammonds (5) and Alan Brown (6). F i n a l
scores were I.C. 45; Sandhurst 62; Reading
66.
