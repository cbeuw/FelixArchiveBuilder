The University newspaper world,
to say nothing of the University i t s e l f ,
was shocked l a s t week when one of the
London evening papers published a r i v a l
to Sennet. The idea of such a scheme
passed through i t s embryonic stages t o -
wards the l a t t e r h a l f of l a s t year; and
without any P r e s i d e n t i a l sanction, the
would-be University contacts aided the
London paper i n i t s project.
P r i o r to publication, many thoughts
were expressed on t h i s subject, and the
general concensus of opinion was that
Sennet would not be able to compete
with such a powerful, and v i r t u a l l y
i d e n t i c a l format, newspaper.
What to do? This was the b i g
problem. Boycott, surely the most
over-worked word i n the English
dictionary, came quickly to mind; but
how? The mental picture of a l i n e of
pickets, around the news-vendor, borders
on the r i d i c u l o u s ; we could decide not
to oblige the E d i t o r with IC news, but
this would not deter, l e t alone prove a
stumbling-block to such a large combine,
as u n o f f i c i a l news i s so easy to obtain.
Reactions around IC have been varied,
but on the whole negative. Despite the
fact that we are continually snubbed by
Sennet i t i s the University's only news-
paper, and as such should be supported i n
preference to, what can only be described
as nothing more than a poor taste p u b l i c -
i t y stunt, hatched i n order to boost
sales among the i n t e l l i g e n s i a of the
University C i t y .

Sir,
It i s generally considered to be bad
form f o r any member of a t h e a t r i c a l company
to take issue with a c r i t i c on the subject
of notices, but since I personally was not
concerned i n the Dramatic Society's pres-
entation of "Without The Prince" perhaps
I may be permitted to comment upon your
notice of that production.
Your c r i t i c ' s views on the meaning
of Drama are his own a f f a i r , but I would
venture to s u r e s t th.-t, holding such
views, he would be w e l l advised to r e f r a i n
from dramatic c r i t i o i s m . The f i e l d of
drama i s an exceedingly wide one, ranging
from tragedy to low comedy. Your c r i t i o ' s
tastes may i n c l i n e towards High Drama,
but the Dramatic Society, for i t s part,
considers that a balanced repertoire i s
of more value, and of more interest to
i t s active members, than a repertoire
consisting s o l e l y of plays of s o c i a l
significance. .
Your c r i t i c at least i s quick to
l e a m , f o r a l l but one of the people
whom he singles out as giving perform-
ances "of the nature that one has learnt
to expect" were freshers, appearing
for the f i r s t time at I.C.
As a " l i g h t i n g expert" of some
experience I was p a r t i c u l a r l y sur-
prised by the concluding sentence.
The l i g h t i n g of t h i s production was by
no means simple; i f i t appeared simple
to your c r i t i o , then the l i g h t i n g
designer had indeed done his work w e l l .
But i f your c r i t i c expects a kaleidoscopic
display i n a setting such as t h i s , we s h a l l
continue to disappoint him. I suggest
that he turns his attention to Opera, where
highly mobile l i g h t i n g can be employed with
considerable benefit to the production.
This i s not often the case i n drama.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
A.D.C. Shipley.
R I C C I - R I G H T
Mr. Shipley (of the above l e t t e r )
would appear to be somewhat confused by
the subtle, nay obvious differences
between drama and play acting. Quite
correctly he points out that drama can
range from tragedy to low comedy, from
'King Lear' to 'Bartholomew F a i r ' .
With t h i s I should not argue, but from
t h i s obvious truism, he then takes the
strangely i l l o g i c a l step of saying,
therefore, a l l that i s performed on the
stage i s drama. Perhaps Mr, Shipley
does not feel that drama i s an art form,
perhaps he does not think that i t s purp-
ose i s not b a s i c a l l y to t e l l a story but
to investigate a situation, maybe he
does not consider that i t i s necessary
for a state of c o n f l i c t to e x i s t between
the actors, and that what I c a l l drama
(he c a l l s high drama) i s rather starchy
and long-hairish. I f t h i s i s so,than
naturally 'Without the Prince' i s drama.
To me i t can never be.
From t h i s , he goes on to suggest
that because I do not hold his views,
I should be f o r ever s i l e n t . From a
presumably thinking person, t h i s
suggestion i s so ludicrous and banal
that I don't consider i t worthy of com-
ment.
B l i n d l y gathering speed, he goes
on to t e l l me that I could not have
'expected' any i n t e r p r e t a t i o n , as most
of the performers were freshers. Had
he read a l i t t l e more c a r e f u l l y , he
would have appreciated that I implied
that we received the interpretations
that a l l previous actors and actresses
have used when performing these roles.
Thus stressing that there seens to be
l i t t l e interest from the actor3 point
of view.
As Mr. Shipley i s , as he says a
' l i g h t i n g expert', i t i s not possible
for me to argue with him on this point
and I should l i k e to condidionally
withdraw the statement. I t was
merely my contention that a more i n t e r -
resting play might have, given wider
scope f o r these people.

Dear S i r ,
That f o u l b i l i o u s attack on my
a r t i c l e ' How to play Chesse ' was grossly
inadequate and what's more quite untrue.
How can anybody c r i t i c i s e that most sacred
of a l l games?
It goes without saying that the back-
bone of this or any other nation are the
chest, players. Indeed, suoh i s the disgust
at that l e t t e r printed i n your l a s t issue
that r e p r i s a l s have allready begun. Some
chess players have even sent delegates to
London to lobby their M.P. to propose a
motion i n the House of Commons that "The
sacred game of chess should be i n v i o l e t "
I o a l l on the ohess players of the
country to unite and again march against
dictatorship, as they d i d once before
when there was a shortage of wood.
Once again the peoples of the world w i l l
be able to move about f r e e l y without fear
of being checked, f o r was i t not Shakespeare
who said ' A l l the world i s a chess board
and a l l the people pawns'?
I demand you to resign S i r , and stop
this perpetual checking, f o r i f you do not?
this paper w i l l become a l i t t l e stale, mate.
F i n a l l y , I would l i k e to say that no
member of the chess club belongs to any
group or sub-group, i n faot I sometimes
wonder whether they are a l i v e at a l l .
Yours Resignedly,
J.Hindley.
President of chess olub.

Dear Sir,
I would l i k e to congratulate
the person or persons who i n s t i g a t e d the
rearrangement of the f u r n i t u r e i n the
ground f l o o r lounge.It i s a pleasant
change to get from one aide of the lounge
to the other without disturbing the news-
paper readers,and I f i n d i t equally pleas-
ant not to be disturbed when I am reading
a newspaper. But why,I wonder,did no-one
think of i t before?
Yours Sincerely, .
Henry Mann.
Dear Mr. Barron,

E d i t i o n coming out?
