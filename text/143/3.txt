On Friday January the 22nd, as a l l
readers of the News Chronicle know, a
race between a sedan chair and a sports
oar took place i n the C i t y . The race
was organised by L i l l i p u t and the occup-
ant of the sedan chair was K i s s June
Thorburn. The eight bearers were a l l
lawyers from IC (whatever they may be)
and ran (or staggered) i n relays of two.
L i l l i p u t i n the best traditions of
English sport divided up the route by
pubs into f i v e stages.
After a number of photographs had
been taken, the race was started by the
f i r s t p a i r , Alan Goodliffe and Jim
Carter, who were i n eighteenth century
dress. They carried Kiss Thorburn as
far as "Ye Olde London" (loungers) where
Gerry Ridgeley and Tony G i f f o r d took over.
The f i r s t two were then rushed by car t o
the "Cheshire Cheese" (Free House) f o r
the l a s t pick up. Meanwhile, the sports
oar (Lotus) had disappeared i n the d i s t -
ance. At the next change "The King Lud"
(Whitbread) Peter Kassler and John
Dewey took over. They handed on t o Tim
Dhonau and Brian Young, who dropped the
chair once (and Miss Thorburn) who
arrived at the "Cheshire Cheese" to f i n d
an exhausted next p a i r , Alan Goodliffe
and Jim Carter, awaiting them.
After a short r e s t , these two reach-
ed Dr Johnson's house i n Gough Square
10 seconds before the sports oar. An
altercation between one photographer
and the bearers developed, when, f o r
the purposes of obtaining a b e t t e r
photograph, the bearers were requested
to run the l a s t twenty yards again. A
reception was then held i n Hulton House
whioh surpassed anything seen there f o r
some time. The bearers departed i n a
drunken state and, so f a r as i s known got
back i n safety.
Two comments to end with. Both By-
Miss Thorburn. The f i r s t was, "I'm not
volunteering f o r t h i s sort of thing very
often", and the second, "Nobody w i l l
believe me when I t e l l them where I got
these bruises." Never mind, Miss
Thorburn, we w i l l .

A mighty fanfare on the pub-
l i c i t y trumpets of Fleet Street
heralded the appearance of the
Evening Standard, University of London
E d i t i o n . Four out of the paper's t o t a l
of twenty pages were devoted to the
University, and an analysis of the actual
contents i s illuminating.
On each page of the paper there are
90 column inches, so that the t o t a l
devoted t o the University was 36O column
inches. Of these 74Â«3 column inches
were devoted t o University news, 128.6
Column inches to photographs of students,
an a r t i c l e on Professor Masaey, head of
UC physics department, 4J6.A, oolumn inches
and adverts 68 column inches. The r e s t
of the four pages were taken up by
headings and gaps. These figures, exp-
ressed as percentages of the whole paper
were:-
1) Student news and photographs,
12.72 %
2) A r t i o l e on Professor Massey,
2.58 %
3) Total aclvertisments ( o f the whole
paper) 869.2 oolumn inches, or
48.29 %
The a r t i c l e s "In London Last Night"
and the Society column t o t a l l e d 103
column inches, of which 22 column inches
were devoted to a singularly weak cartoon.
Expressed as a percentage, 5.85 % i I
quote these figures without comment.
standard. The back page consisted of
photographs of students and t h e i r views
on r e l i g i o u s education i n schools; and
that was that.
I f the Evening Standard wishes t o
s e l l t h i s edition regularly, as i s t h e i r
intention, I believe, then they might do
w e l l to remember that monosyllabic
platitudes and t e p i d comment w i l l not
endear them t o students, who, on the
whole prefer l i v e l y discussion and v i g o r -
ous c r i t i c i s m .
One f i n a l comment, Sennet's usual
habit of leaving IC out i n the cold has
spread to Fleet Street. The t o t a l men-
t i o n of Iff, including B a s i l James on the
sports page ran t o 3.1 column inches
(i.e. 1.53 % of the t o t a l ULU newe). IC
I would remind you, eaters f o r about 10 %
of the ULU population.
Since t h i s a r t i o l e was w r i t t e n , the
f o l l o w i n g l e t t e r has been drafted t o the
Evening Standard:-
S i r ,
We would l i k e to express our disgust
at the way you are using our University
as a peg on which to hang your l a t e s t
sales-drive.
Surely you could have given us a
revealing view of the private l i f e of
some "personality", or s e r i a l i s e d yet
another b e s t - s e l l e r , or employed any of
the other tawdry routines used by second
rate newspapers to s e l l more; anything
rather than resort t o the sickening
practice of involving the largest c o l l e g -
iate University i n the world i n oheap
commercialism.
Now l e t us consider the a r t i c l e s i n
d e t a i l , I mean of course, those connected
with the University, f o r the other 16
pages were t y p i c a l of evening newspapers,
and not worth reading. On the front
page was a rambling review of ULU, whioh
reminded me of Shakespeare's ' ' t i s a t a l e
t o l d by an i d i o t , f u l l of sound and fury,
s i g n i f y i n g nothing'. The middle pages
oontained the a r t i c l e about Prof. Massey
which was bearable, an a r t i c l e about
sport, which wasn't, and some jottings
whioh were of the F e l i x Confidential
We suppose i t i s having the desired
e f f e c t since many of us have bought
copies from the men s p e c i a l l y posted out-
side the Union 30 that we could "see our-
selves i n the papers".
We appreciate your desire t o s e l l
your newspaper, but l a y o f f London

L i f e at College, away from the Lec-
ture theatre, i s e s s e n t i a l l y s o c i a l .
Which type of education best prepares the
student f o r this? Is i t the Grammar
School or P u b l i c School?
There are more students i n the
University from Grammar Schools than
Pablio Schools. You may, therefore, be
i n c l i n e d to think that i f the s o c i a l
pattern i s set by the majority, the
majority i s best suited to the s o c i a l
l i f e . You may be r i g h t , but just
b r i e f l y l e t us examine the two forms
of education and t h e i r effects upon a
man's outlook and character.
The essential difference i s that a
Public School i s generally a boarding
school, a Grammar School i s a day school.
So the Grammar School boy spends
part of each day with h i s parents and
family. He KJIOWS tnat a f t e r school
he can go back to the s e c u r i t y of his
home. This cannot help him to develop
self-confidence. On the other hand,
he mixes with a broad cross-section of
society both i n and out of school. He
meets older and more mature people than
himself. At the same time, however, he
becomes acutely conscious of class d i s -
t i n c t i o n s .
The f a c t that the l u b l i c School boy
i s away from home induoes him to provide
his own security by becoming independent.
He has no one to provide sympathy and he
learns to look a f t e r himself. So he
gains a great deal of self-confidence.
He mixes mainly with h i s own type, and
so he i s less aware of clas3 d i s t i n c t i o n .
These a t t r i b u t e s together enable him, on
contact w i t h the world outside his c l o i s -
tered existence to talk with a l l types of
people without embarrassment.
Which type of man moulds most e a s i l y
to University l i f e ?
Is i t the Grammar School boy, who
has mixed widely has a broad outlook,
but who i s not s e l f confident? Or i s i t
the P u b l i c School boy, w i t h his independ-
ence, s e l f confidence and p o l i s h , but
who has not mixed so much?.
I b e l i e v e the self-oonfidenoe of the
l a t t e r overcomes h i s inexperience of
mixing and f i t s him best f o r the arduous
s o c i a l l i f e at College.
I wonder what I.C.W.A. thinks about
this? They should be i m p a r t i a l judges.
