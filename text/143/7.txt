FELIX 7
S K I T R I P
The annual tour of the 1.0. Ski
Olub to the mountsins found us this year
In Saas Fee, & small Tillage some 6000
feet above sea l e v e l i n the Valais
d i s t r i o t b f Switzerland, which proved to
be an excellent choice from every
point of view. Perhaps the most important
advantage was that, unlike Kltzbuhel the
year before, there was snow i n abundance,
and the skiing conditions were excellent.
The majority of the party t r a v e l l e d
by t r a i n , leaving London early on 29th
Deo., and passing through Dover, Ostend,
Basle and Berne on t h e i r way to B r i g .
Perhaps the only major excitement on
t h i s part of the journey was the uninten-
t i o n a l p u l l i n g of the communication cord
by one of the party before the t r a i n l e f t
Ostend, whioh produced not only deep w a i l -
ing and rushes of Mighty Wind from the
bowels of the t r a i n , but also a f l u r r y of
officialdom.
Prom B r i g the party t r a v e l l e d by r a i l
to Stalden, there leaving the route to
Zermatt and enjoying what was perhaps
the most exciting hour of the holiday, i n
the form of a bus journey up the side of
a v a l l e y i n t o Saas Pee. On many occasions
did the party resign i t s e l f to what seemed
an i n e v i t a b l e fate, and discussion centred
on terminal velocities' of f a l l i n g buses.
I t oame as no surprise when, on rounding a
bend, a snow plough was seen t o be blocking
the road, i t s d r i v e r having gone to lunch.
In s p i t e of t h i s and the f a c t that the bus
then ran short of p e t r o l , I.C. turned up
i n Saas Pee apparently l i t t l e the worse
for wear.
The small party »ho t r a v e l l e d by a i r
(that quick, modern, e f f i o i e n t way) landed
at Basle instead of Geneva and had to make
t h e i r own way from there. Reports are
c i r c u l a t i n g that one member of the group
spent his holiday i n Montreux. But most
of them arrived.
Once i n Saas Pee, the party divided
themselves i n t o three Pensions. I t i s
reported that the porter who c a r r i e d the
luggage to the Pension Supersaxo, wearing
a Supersaxo cap, then changed his oap and
performed a s i m i l a r service for the guests
at the Pensions "Alpina" and "Garni des
Alpes." This I caimot deny.
Prom then onwards followed eleven
days of wonderful s k i i n g , enjoyed a l i k e
by beginners and more experienced skiers*.
There was one long run f o r good skiers,
from the Lange Plua Hut, down v i a SPIEL-
BODEN i n t o Saas Pee, a f a l l of 3,500 f t .
I f Saas Pee had some a l t e r n a t i v e long
descents early i n the season; one could
regard i t as a Utopia f o r skiers.
True there were other a t t r a c t i o n s on
the slopes, and everyone w i l l by now have
heard of the young lady who, r e a l i s i n g
that the s i t t i n g position, occupies much
of the beginners time, determined that
she would do so as near as possible t o
her charming instructor, who then had the
e x c i t i n g task of p i c k i n g her up. However,
i n s p i t e of f r i v o l i t i e s , most members of
the party l e f t Saas Pee more p r o f i c i e n t
i n the a r t of s k i i n g than when they a r r i v e d .
Some even gained experience in crossing
glaciers roped together and i n spending
afternoons i n sub-zero mountain huts.
We poor students' found that the
organisers had imported professional
card-sharp3 instead of l a d i e s and Tie
popsy even had her own loaded poke.'
dloe - OhS How do you play i t ? didn't
hold water f o r many nights - d i s c i p l e s of
B i l k o . The party enjoyed some very gay
evenings, among3t which the evening spent
at the Walliserhof will long be remem-
bered, i f only f o r the vast quantities of
wine and Fondue consumed and the im-
promptu piano work by Patsey which had
everyone on t h e i r f e e t , even o l d Peg Leg
Percy, dancing a cunningly executed "Rock."
On several occasions nocturnal rides
were enjoyed on sledges, much to the
oonstemation of the l o o a l p o l i c e . T r i a l s
showed beyond doubt that a sledge travels
faster the more people you have on i t .

But although much research was done on the
matter no s a t i s f a c t o r y method of steering
around 90 degree s t r e e t corners was est-
ablished. Also there seemed to be only
one way of stopping i n a hurry and i t was
very p a i n f u l .
Accidents were few, and s l i g h t , but
for two rather notable exceptions. I n
f a c t skis suffered more than skiers; a
c e r t a i n I.C. man found i t d i f f i c u l t to
steer himself between two narrowly-
spaced trees: he l o s t h a l f a s k i but kept
his l e g , (only to break a bone i n h i s foot
the next day).
The journey home was uneventful,
apart from the annoying delays i n the
t r a i n schedule. But everyone was pre-
pared t o put up with a l i t t l e incon-
venience, considering i t small repayment
for such a f i n e holiday.

Both squash teams got sway to a
good start last Saturday by beating
Cardiff University 1st. and 2nd. teams
5 - 0 and 3 - 2 . The 1st, team matoh
was something of a foregone conclusion
sinoe we had our strongest team out,
and only one game was lost in the five
matches played. The second match,
however,provided one of the most closely
contested for a long time. Most
of the glory goes to John White,
who played last with the score in
matones 2-2. Things went badly to
start with and he found himself 0-2
down in games and 2-7 down in the
last game; whether i t was the voc-
iferous, i r beery support from a much
more crowded gallery than usual, I
don't know, but suddenly he became
inspired, fighting back to win the
game 9-7, then the next game, and
finally the last game to win the
matoh 3-2. Mention should also be
made of Ged Brough, who gallantly
same in at the last moment, and
proved himself to be well! worthy of
the plane, by winning his matoh
suite easily.
On Tuesday our "A" Team reoieved
. crushing defeat from L.S.E. In
est years they have played the 2nd
team, but this year they are partic-
ularly strong and deserve a 1st Team
fixture, whioh we hope to arrange
later this term. Both the Captain
and Secretary played at short not-
ice and were defeated in two good
matches; they were the only people
to get games off their opponents.
The 1st team will have to play
well i f they are going to win, and
I think i t should prove a very olose
matoh, whichever way i t goes.
Next Monday the 1st Round of
the U.L. Individual Championship i s
to be played off at St, Mary's Hosp-
i t a l . Six players are entered -
Messrs Avient, Espig, Odell, Bullock,
Haywood, and Creasy - and we wish
them luok particularly Brian Avient
who has the job of "tripping up"
Mike Kingston, the University
Captain. Also the Club is due to
play U.C. in the 2nd Round or the
Tgleeias Cup - 3 a aids College com
petition - sometime within the next
week or two. This should prove to
be a close match.
Most of the 2nd Round of the
Whitely Cup— College Individual
Championship - have now been played
off, and i t is hoped that the third
round can be arranged for Wednesday
3rd, Feb. There were 4
.
1 entries
this year including two young ladies

, one of whom Brenda White
won her f i r s t round easily and com-
fortably, to be defeated in the sec-
ond by Ronnie Creasy, whom, yH m
glad to say, she made do quite a bit
of running.
